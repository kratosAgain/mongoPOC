Yankee
Dime
and
Other
Reginal
Expressions
Some
years
ago
when
sportscaster
Red
Barber
used
Southern
expressions
like
sitting
in
the
catbird
seat
and
tearing
up
the
pea
patch
there
was
degree
of
national
amusement
Unfortunately
much
of
this
colorful
speech
has
been
lost
as
the
language
has
become
homogenized
through
raido
and
television
Sigmund
Freud
is
not
blameless
Thanks
to
him
we
are
all
nowadays
more
or
less
selfconscious
The
generation
that
came
of
age
in
the
first
two
decades
of
the
century
was
probably
the
last
of
the
unselfconscious
breed
And
because
there
was
much
less
travel
in
those
days
the
regions
retained
their
speechways
much
more
completely
than
they
do
now
Later
however
especially
during
World
War
II
there
was
considerable
mobility
from
region
to
region
Southerners
who
went
up
North
were
quickly
made
aware
of
curiosities
of
speech
like
I'm
fixing
to
do
something
or
go
somewhere
And
there
was
hilarity
among
Northerners
for
instance
when
Southerner
asked
Who's
carrying
you
to
the
dance?
Carry
in
Southernese
meant
escort
Hush
puppies
and
hoe
cakes
were
also
terms
sure
to
attact
attention
fifty
years
ago
but
are
now
in
common
use
Hoe
cakes
originally
baked
on
hoe
and
hush
puppies
allegedly
so
named
because
pieces
of
them
were
fed
to
dogs
to
keep
them
quite
are
variations
of
what
Southerners
call
corn
bread
and
New
Englanders
call
(spider)
johnnycake:
spider
because
it
was
baked
in
spider
black
cast-iron
skillet
And
when
Northern
visitors
to
the
South
first
saw
black-eyed
peas
they
were
puzzled
We
call
these
beans
they
would
say
When
we
say
peas
we
mean
what
Southerners
call
English
peas
or
green
peas
Northerners
were
also
amused
at
Southern
matriarch's
saying
to
tardy
arrival
at
the
dinner
table
We've
waited
for
you
the
way
one
pig
waits
for
another
Those
were
the
days
of
the
enormous
midday
meal
Most
men
worked
close
to
home
and
the
paterfamilias
as
well
as
all
school
children
came
home
for
dinner
It
was
the
custom
to
cook
large
quantities
of
many
vegetables
and
at
least
two
breads
for
this
meal
Yeast
bread
was
called
light
bread
and
corn
bread
was
corn
pone
corn
dodgers
hoecake
or
hush
puppies
Even
in
small
families
large
meals
were
prepared
at
midday
One
could
never
tell
how
many
people
might
drop
in
In
big
families
the
cook
customarily
went
to
her
own
garden
or
to
the
curb
market
now
called
the
farmers'
marker
to
lay
in
big
supply
of
vegetables
and
fruit
Usually
enough
was
cooked
for
supper
too
However
if
everything
came
out
even
with
nothing
left
over
the
meal
came
out
like
Willie
Ross's
fish
If
some
foold
was
particularly
tasty
beyond
delicious
it
was
larruping
If
someone
ate
too
much
he
had
hog's
bait
The
word
bait
used
as
noun
meaning
sufficiency
is
given
in
few
language
references
In
Southern
parlance
bait
ment
more
than
enough
hog's
bait
was
gluttonous
plenty
She
has
more
than
she
can
say
grace
over
was
another
expression
which
seems
to
have
disappeared
Even
though
it
refers
to
grace
before
meat
and
thus
means
that
the
materfamilias
has
more
people
to
feed
than
she
can
manage
the
term
was
used
in
many
situations
of
someone
whose
load
was
too
heavy
If
child
in
early
attempts
at
cookery
made
mess
it
was
mommick
or
begarm
both
of
which
were
used
as
noun
and
verb
However
the
word
bollix
meaning
to
bungle
was
used
only
as
verb
Bollix
is
the
only
one
of
the
three
terms
listed
in
most
language
references
It
is
safe
bet
that
many
who
use
the
term
bollix
(informal)
do
not
know
that
it
is
variant
spelling
of
ballocks
(vulgar)
testes
Before
store-bought
clothing
was
available
homemade
was
the
rule
During
fitting
if
something
was
too
tight
it
was
as
tight
as
Dick's
hat
band
and
would
have
to
be
altered
Girls
learned
to
sew
at
an
early
age
For
some
it
was
slow
and
tedious
business
but
others
picked
it
up
fast
and
sewed
with
red
hot
needle
and
burning
thread
Although
it
is
standard
to
use
the
adverb
directly
for
right
away
it
is
not
used
as
much
now
in
American
English
as
formerly
I'll
be
there
directly
sometimes
contracted
to
treckly
was
frequently
heard
as
was
in
three
shakes
of
dead
sheep's
tail
colorful
hunorous
variant
on
the
usual
in
two
shakes
of
lamb's
tail
bossy
woman
was
the
old
ballyo
(bell
ewe?)
and
of
person
who
put
on
airs
it
was
said
She's
got
b-i-g
place
If
plans
went
haywire
they
went
skywest
and
crooked
Children
were
warned
not
to
go
at
some
task
with
main
strength
and
awkwardness
or
not
to
go
whalestaving
at
some
job
When
youngsters
overdid
some
subject
they
were
told
not
to
make
blowing
horn
of
it
In
the
early
days
of
TV
dancing
groups
blanketed
the
air
waves
This
early
dancing
was
fairly
frenzied
gyrating
which
Perelman
labeled
fire-in-awhorehouse
choreography
Oldsters
called
it
didapping
Why
are
they
didapping
all
over
the
place
like
that
some
would
ask
Few
things
are
as
crude
as
antiquated
slang;
consider
the
terms
dandy-funk
and
hambeaters
circa
1910
Some
men
it
was
said
wore
dandy-funk
on
their
hambeaters
Dandy-funk
is
perfume
and
hambeaters
are
the
long
tails
of
swallow-tailed
coat
widely
worn
during
that
period
Another
relic
of
that
period
not
heard
any
more
is
the
call
to
children
for
household
help:
Come
quick
and
see
old
Ringdie!
The
source
is
unknown;
perhaps
it
originated
when
dog
named
Ring
was
in
his
death
throes
and
the
family
were
being
called
Ringdie
was
said
as
one
word
and
the
call
was
made
if
one
wanted
quick
response
Some
of
the
common
comparisons
were:
slow
as
the
seven-year
itch
mad
as
biting
sow
though
as
withleather
fierce
as
boar
hog
flat
as
flitter
and
hot
as
flugens
Neither
fitter
(in
this
sense)
nor
flugens
appears
in
any
readily
available
American
dialect
reference
nor
do
they
appear
to
be
related
to
German
words
of
similar
sound
Nor
does
the
prized
gold
monkey
If
person
an
employee
for
example
was
highly
valued
it
was
said
His
boss
wouldn't
trade
him
of
gold
monkey
Every
child
learned
the
right
way
to

Mississippi:

The
earlier
generation
of
males
wanted
hot
biscuits
for
breakfast
and
spoke
disparagingly
of
baker's
bread
as
wasps'
nests
Skim
milk
was
blue
John
widely
used
term
Also
common
was
the
term
Yankee
dime
as
in
not
worth
Yankee
dime
This
regionalism
was
used
mainly
at
Christmas:
if
person
wanted
to
make
it
clear
he
had
not
given
friend
(?)
gift
he
would
say
gave
him
Yankee
dime
The
term
means
kiss
but
was
used
disparagingly
as
in
to
kiss
off
Not
in
any
reference
work
checked
it
is
probably
relic
of
Southern
attitudes
after
the
Civil
War
as
is
the
term
gone
to
Lincoln
The
latter
refers
to
property
which
had
been
appropriated
because
the
home
ovwner
had
not
paid
taxes
on
it
The
South
was
indeed
the
Bible
Belt
as
Mencken
labeled
it
However
not
only
the
South
but
the
whole
country
was
caught
up
in
religious
revivalism
during
the
early
decades
of
the
century
The
best-known
national
revivalists
were
William
Jennings
Bryan
and
William
A
Billie
Sunday
But
there
were
hundreds
of
lesser-known
revivalists
whose
teams
blanketed
the
South
These
revivals
usually
lasted
two
weeks
and
were
also
called
rotracted
meetings
During
the
summers
every
city
and
small
town
had
its
revival
tent
where
repentant
sinners
walked
down
the
aisle
the
sawdust
trail
to
the
mourners'
bench
for
prayer
and
sometimes
emotional
repentance
Ordinary
people
especially
children
genuinely
tried
to
be
good
in
word
and
deed
The
children
were
probably
damaged
beyond
repair
because
they
were
not
allowed
to
take
the
Lord's
name
in
vain
or
to
swear
use
words
like
devil
and
hell
Instead
of
devil
they
were
to
say
the
bad
man
and
instead
of
hell
the
bad
place
Churchgoers
were
told
not
to
call
anyone
fool
no
matter
how
justified
the
label
because
there
was
an
injuction
against
it
in
the
Bible
(Matthew
5:22)
Keeping
the
Sabbath
was
also
important
Respectable
people
never
did
washing
on
Sunday
And
as
for
sewing
on
Sunday
the
old
superstition
stated
that
if
person
sewed
on
Sunday
the
devil
would
make
the
sinner
rip
every
stitch
with
his/her
nose
Of
course
no
one
took
this
seriously
However
two
New
England
superstitions
were
taken
seriously
One
known
also
in
Europe
warned
against
giving
knives
as
gifts:
they
would
cut
the
friendship
The
other
warned
against
watching
parting
guest
out
of
sight:
bad
luick
would
ensue
Another
superstition
warned
woman
contemplating
marriage
Change
the
name
and
not
the
letter
change
for
worse
and
not
for
better
In
the
old
days
standard
farewell
was
You
keep
out
of
meanness
hear?
Though
it
was
often
used
jokingly
it
was
the
equivalent
of
the
current
Have
good
day

you

[From
an
advertisement
in
the
Sunday
Telegraph
Submitted
by
Anti-Language
If
the
chief
use
of
language
is
to
communicate
it
might
come
as
surprise
to
note
few
of
the
times
when
language
is
used
specially
to
confuse
and
alienate
Anti-languages
do
just
this:
their
reason
for
existence
is
to
ensure
secrecy
by
being
understood
by
only
small
band
of
people
Once
too
many
people
have
cracked
the
code
most
important
when
those
who
have
done
so
are
in
some
way
opposed
to
the
anti-language's
users
the
language
becomes
obsolete
and
dies
Linguistically
speaking
an
anti-language
is
formed
by
process
of
relexicalization
which
is
substituting
new
words
for
old
The
grammar
of
the
original
language
is
kept
but
distinctive
vocabulary
develops
quite
often
when
referring
to
activities
or
areas
important
to
the
subculture
that
the
creating
the
language
Established
society
usually
has
its
nose
put
slightly
out
of
joint
in
the
process
John
S
Farmer
co-editor
of
Slang
and
Its
Analogues
wrote
in
1890
The
borderland
between
slang
and
the
Queen's
English
is
an
ill-defined
territory
the
limits
of
which
have
never
been
clearly
mapped
out
Other
linguists
who
have
taken
on
the
chalenge
of
doing
so
include
Jonathan
Green
Hotten
Grose
William
and
Mary
Morris
Wentworth
and
Flexner
and
Eric
Partridge
who
published
the
first
edition
of
his
enormous
Dictionary
of
Slag
and
Unconvential
English
in
1937
Further
back
as
long
ago
as
1792
Friedrich

knowledge
that

But
if
the

Convicts

criminal
argot
described
by
James
Hardy
Vaux
as
flash
language
in
his
New
and
Comprehensive
Vocabulary
of
the
Flash
Language
of
1812
Vaux
in
fact
was
criminal
himself
but
also
linguist;
transported
to
the

three
times
he
used
the
journeys
as
opportunities
for

Most
of
the

he

did
not

Possibly

Let
us
look
at
the
modern
underworld
In
friendly
manner
two
men
are
talking
in
the
presence
of
third
man
an
impostor
detective
or
an
investigative
reporter
who
believes
he
has
infiltrated
their
ranks
His
problem
is
that
the
first
two
are
aware
of
his
deception
The
first
man
says
to
the
second
Shall
we
clear
up
this
mess?
No
the
second
replies
we'll
leave
it
for
the
cleaner
Little
does
the
impostor
know
that
he
has
just
been
sentenced
to
death
for
what
was
really
said
was
Shall
we
kill
him?
No
we'll
leave
it
to
professional
cleaner
is
hired
gun
an
assassin
or
at
least
it
was
until
recently
Now
the
definition
is
too
well
known
and
it
will
shortly
be
dropping
away
Cleaner
is
word
which
adheres
to
the
second
principle
of
an
anti-language:
the
word
employed
in
the
process
of
relexicalzation
should
not
itself
be
conspicuous
great
deal
of
argot
appears
to
be
ordinary
language
not
only
in
the
English-speaking
sunderworld
In
india
sentence
that
translates
into
English
as
Go
clean
the
bowl
is
used
by
murderer
to
an
associate
in
front
of
victim
It
means
Prepare
grave
(Note
the
similar
links
between
murder
and
hygiene)
Few
studies
however
have
been
made
into
the
language
of
underground
groups
not
least
because
of
the
dangers
to
researchers
We
know
that
the
language
of
the
Calcuttan
underworld
contains
more
than
forty
words
for
police
and
more
than
twenty
for
bomb
Often
the
meanings
of
such
code
words
are
detected
and
then
they
promptly
go
out
of
use;
sometimes
they
are
not
detected
at
all
The
same
is
true
of
the
anti-language
of
prisoners
Considerably
more
is
known
about
grypserka
the
anti-language
of
Polish
prisoners
than
about
any
English-speaking
system
but
even
that
knowledge
is
incomplete
and
out-of-date
The
alternative
second
life
inside
Polish
prisons
involves
complex
caste
system
of
people
and
suckers
categories
determined
by
the
type
of
offence
involved
and
the
length
of
incarceration
Movement
within
the
hierarchy
depends
on
sticking
to
the
rules
of
game
in
which
grypserka
figures
prominently
An
inmate
is
downgraded
to
sucker
by
breaking
the
rules
one
of
which
is
never
ever
to
reveal
the
secrets
of
the
anti-language
no
matter
what
pardon
or
privilege
is
offered
It
is
concept
well
known
in
all
prison
systems
In
England
prisoner
would
be
grassing
English
prison
slang
is
readily
enough
available
in
any
prison
drama
or
comedy:
screw
is
guard
snout
is
tobacco
nonce
is
child
molester
or
other
sex
offender
and
nick
or
porridge
is
prison
itself
This
is
not
anti-language
for
we
all
understand
it
This
outdated
prison
slang
is
used
almost
nostalgically
in
the
same
way
that
some
people
still
employ
Cockney
rhyming
slag
(which
was
once
itself
an
anti-language)
Anti-language
is
not
easy
to
define
as
it
does
not
have
rigid
rules
to
which
subculture's
inventions
must
conform
Nor
is
it
easy
to
determine
its
origins
although
historically
an
argot
known
as
pelting
speech
was
employed
by
bands
of
ne'er-do-wells
in
Elizabethan
England
There
were
over
twenty
terms
for
varying
types
of
vagabond:
rogue
prigger
of
prancers
horse
thief
counterfeit
crank
and
bawdy
basket
are
but
few
Both
then
and
now
new
vocabulary
in
key
areas
lead
to
finer
distinctions
in
meaning
than
are
found
in
the
parent
language
There
are
many
synonyms
and
for
the
speakers
there
is
the
comfort
that
comes
with
the
freedom
to
discuss
illegal
acts
in
public
places
While
slang
is
not
itself
anti-language
it
exhibits
some
of
its
tendencies
Slag
has
as
many
divisions
as
the
English
language
has
dialects
Youth
slag
soldier
slang
actor
slang
gay
slang
CB
slang
the
list
is
endless
And
every
gang
wants
its
own
argot
test
by
which
potential
recruit
can
be
measured:
if
you
don't
know
the
language
very
often
you
cannot
get
in;
or
if
you
are
already
in
not
knowing
the
latest
key
words
can
be
disastrous
for
your
credibility
Slang
is
means
of
unification;
for
those
who
use
it
it
is
fun
unconventional
and
sassy
What
is
more
it
can
be
witty
picturesque
metaphoric
How
it
differs
from
anti-language
is
that
while
it
often
intends
to
subvert
it
does
so
by
being
understood
(at
least
in
part)
by
the
world
at
large
Where
the

It
is
important
to
remember
however
that
what
survives
of
this
generation's
slang
may
bacome
the
next
generation's
standard
English
Bus
was
the
slang
term
for
omnibus
zoo
for
zoological
gardens
and
piano
for
pianoforte
The
board
slang
once
used
on
Citizens'
Band
radio
has
similarities
with
anti-language
although
even
the
police
more
often
regarded
CB
users
as
eccentric
nuisances
than
criminals
The
users
however
revelled
in
their
outlawed
status;
the
police
were
well
represented
in
the
CB
lexis
They
were
bears
or
smokeys
police
station
bear
cage
or
cave
police
helicopter
bear
in
the
air
Police
using
radar
were
kojaks
with
kadaks
More
confusingly
police
car
was
jam
sandwich
or
bubble-gum
machine
The
way
CB
expressions
run
along
metaphorical
pathways
is
reminiscent
of
pelting
speech
Blood

Teenage
slang
in
England
in
this
decade
has
been
strongly
influenced
by
African
and
American
cultures
by
immigration
and
by
cinema
Wrongly

being
lazy
language
youth
slag
is
in
fact
as
complex
and
rhythmic
as
any
dialect
The
words
man
well
hard
wicked
and
swear-words
are
not
simply
idle
padding
for
sentence
they
are
an
intrinsic
part
of
the
language
That
so
many
adults
disapprove
of
the
way
the
youth
communicate
is
precisely
what
keeps
this
variety
of
slang
going
This
leads
to
the
issue
of
talking
Black
Linguistically
Black
English
has
origins
in
Caribbean
(mainly
Jamaican)
Creole
Black
English
patois
does
not
vary
much
from
region
to
region
and
belongs
to
an
ethnically
defined
social
group
In
Black
sittings
its
use
ensures
soldarity
between
speakers;
in
White
or
mixed
sittings
the
use
of
the
patois
symbolizes
social
distance
from
mainstream
society
and
an
assertion
of
ethnic
identity
The
more
linguistically
distinct
the
sounds
of
patois
the
more
it
can
come
to
symbolize
social
distance
Here
is
approaches
the
status
of
anti-language
For
some
Black
speakers
talking
Black
provides
system
of
resistance
on
linguistic
level
to
powerful
social
order
It
has
long
since
been
noted
that
when
two
people
who
come
from
different
social
backgrounds
meet
there
is
often
tendency
for
their
speech
to
alter
so
that
they
become
more
alike
process
known
as
accommodation
or
convergence
Its
opposite
divergence
occurs
when
people
wish
to
stress
their
personal
social
religious
or
sexual
identity;
divergence
takes
on
position
of
confrontation
though
is
often
said
to
be
result
of
the
speaker's
pride
Anti-language
is
divergence
on
grand
scale
and
most
varieties
of
slang
are
at
least
sympathetic
to
the
philosophy
and
purposes
of
anti-language
Are
we
faced
with
the
paradox
in
which
groups
of
English
speakers
effectively
use
different
languages?
Very
unlikely
But
perhaps
there
will
be
rethinking
of
the
word
communication
and
an
instinctive
scintilla
of
caution
when
communicating
outside
one's
social
group

the
version
given
in
The
Dictionary
of
Contemporary
Slang
by
Jonathon
Green
(Pan
Books
1984
rev
ed
1992):
The
term
originated
in
the
West
Country
specifically
Torbay
where
local
remarked
that
the
stream
of
visitors
to
the
town
resembled
little
Grocks
or
clowns
most
detailed
and
circumstantial
account
of
its
genesis
which
more
than
little
impresses
me
also
traces
its
origin
to
the
Torbay
area
and
comic
but
not
of
the
Grock
variety
This
version
claims
that
grockle
was
the
spontaneous
coinage
of
worker
in
the
southwest
holiday
trade
prompted
by
an
early
memory
of
picture
story
in
children's
comic
Between
1952
and
1960
Arthur
Rivers
then
in
his
twenties
and
Londoner
by
birth
was
in
charge
of
the
boating-lake
at
Goodrington
district
of
Paignton
in
Devon
now
part
of
Torbay
In
the
summer
of
1955
or
1956
Mr
Rivers
saw
among
the
customers
tiny
old
lady
with
beady
eyes
pointed
nose
and
ruddy
weatherbeaten
pinched-up
face
He
was
so
struck
by
her
appearance
that
he
observed
to
his
assistant
that
the
old
lady
was
like
little
grockle
His
assistant
not
surprisingly
replied
What
the
hell's
grockle?
Mr
Rivers
explained
that
he
had
been
reminded
of
figure
from
picture
serial
he
had
once
read
called
Jimmy
and
his
Grockle
The
grockle
was
small
dragonlike
creature
with
magic
powers
Mr
rivers
tells
me
that
he
could
not
recall
the
name
of
the
comic
when
he
had
seen
it
and
even
whether
it
was
British
or
an
American
import
The
old
lady
and
the
three
equally
diminutive
adults
and
two
small
children
in
her
North
Country
group
regularly
visited
the
boating-lake
during
their
holiday
and
the
staff
took
fancy
to
the
expression
Mr
Rivers
had
used
and
would
say
things
like
Your
grockle
family's
here
and
so
on
The
term
survived
the
departure
of
the
originals
and
was
soon
consciously
adopted
for
all
the
holidaying
patrons
mainly
from
the
Midlands
and
North
by
the
large
number
of
seasonal
employees
at
the
lake
Mr
Rivers'
assistant
Freddie
Fly
wrote
an
Ode
to
the
Grockle
and
the
coaches
bringing
the
tourists
were
christened
grockle
wagons
Mr
Rivers
has
emphasized
to
me
that
the
word
was
not
then
used
in
disparaging
way
but
more
as
kind
of
professional
in-joke
with
about
the
same
force
as
the
now
universal
punter
client
customer
part
of
the
verbal
comaraderie
of
lively
band
of
young
workers
The
word
became
current
among
the
families
of
the
boating-lake's
local
staff
and
outlasted
the
season
to
be
acquired
later
by
other
holiday
trade
people
in
the
area
such
as
the
Paignton-born
novelist
and
local
columnist
Brian
Carter
In
an
article
in
Torbay's
Herald
Express
(May
1993)
he
remembered
hearing
grockle
for
the
first
time
in
the
late
1950s
when
working
on
the
Goodrington
promenade
From
there
it
would
inevitably
spread
to
Paignton
and
Torquay
the
towns
which
with
Brixham
now
make
up
Torbay
By
the
early
1960s
Freddie
Fly
had
become
barman
at
Brixham
pub
and
there
met
writer
Peter
Draper
who
was
working
on
screenplay
for
flim
based
on
the
adventures
of
seasonal
workers
in
the
holiday
industry
He
picked
up
Freddie
Fly's
use
of
grockle
to
add
authenticity
to
his
script
The
flim
starring
Oliver
Reed
was
released
in
Britain
in
1964
as
The
System
the
system
being
one
to
pull
birds
and
in
the
US
as
The
Girl-Getters
more
explicit
rendering
of
the
same
idea
This
was
the
first
national
publicity
for
the
hitherto
local

well
as
its

added
about
fifteen
more

the
narrative
with
an

be
that
in

these

played
part
in
the

of
the

during

of

1960s
The
word
was
certainly
hard
to
escape
in
the
Torbay
area
in
the
early
1970s
and
by
then
often
had
derisive
flavour

Arthur
Rivers
who
had
become
the
landlord
of
Paignton
pub
took
part
in
Radio
Four
programme
with
Peter
Draper
Brian
Carter
and
an
OED
representative
At
the
end
the
presenter
handed
Mr
Rivers
photocopy
from
1937
issue
of
The
Dandy
British
weekly
children's
comic
The
page
heading
was
Jimmy
and
His
Grockle
so
Mr
Rivers
was
able
to
validate
and
localize
the
memory
that
had
floated
to
the
surface
of
his
mind
in
the
mid
1950s
Grockle
turned
out
to
be
onomatopoeic
being
all
the
little
dragon
ever
said
The
first
number
of
The
Dandy
published
by
D
C
Thomson
of
Dundee
was
dated
December
1937
when
Arthur
Rivers
would
have
been
six
or
seven
years
old
However
Jimmy
and
his
Grockle
had
started
in
1932
as
conventional
serial
story
in
another
Thomson
children's
publication
The
Rover
before
being
tracslated
into
picture
strip
form
in
1937
It
ran
again
in
the
DC
Thomson
comic
Sparky
from
1966
to
1976
Perhaps
it
was
The
System
that
helped
grockle
to
beome
so
far-flung
and
win
out
over
the
allegedly
more
vivid
but
today
still
Cornwall-confined
emmet
But
personally
would
speculate
that
the
unknown
creator
of
Jimmy
and
his
Grockle
in
the
early
1930s
keew
the
sort
of
word
that
resonates
in
children's
memories
Could
further
reason
for
the
word's
success
be
that
it
rhymes
with
the
name
of
kind
of
edible
molluse
that
is
traditional
feature
of
British
seaside
holidays?
It
clearly
seems
to
have
appealed
to
the
writer
of
some
verses
in
Shooting
Times
Country
Magazine
for
14
August
1975
not
spotted
by
the
OED
which
ran
in
part:
There

here
they
call
them

Latter-day

When
Joseph
Smith
announced
to

in
the
early
19th
century
that
he
had
seen
God
and
gave
to

his
Golden
Bible
(The

of

he
certainly
introduced

cases

on

words)
full
exposition
of
strictly
doctrinal
terms
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
article
because
such
listing
would
entail
detailed
examination
of
Mormon
doctrine
Speaking
of
Mormon
doctrine
the
term
used
as
general-purpose
noun
adjective
and
adverb
as
an
unofficial
designation
for
the
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latter-day
Saints
and
its
adherents
and
comes
from
The
Book
of
Mormon
book
that
Joseph
Smith
claims
to
have
translated
from
gold
plates
goven
to
him
by
an
angle
The
book
claims
to
be
parallel
to
the
Bible
but
pertaining
to
the
New
World
and
relates
the
religious
history
of
several
groups
of
people
Talking
about
the
book
in
scholarly
way
in
somewhat
like
discussing
Tolkien's
works
which
also
contain
richly
developed
cultural
world
In
Tolkien's
case
it
is
self-evident
that
his
Lord
of
the
Rings
trilogy
is
work
of
fiction
and
non-Moromons
would
probably
assign
the
Book
of
Mormon
to
the
same
category;
but
faithful
Mormons
take
its
truth
seriously
(whether
strictly
historical
on
one
end
of
spectrum
to
mythologically
symbolic
on
the
other
end)
albeit
of
faith
This
is
by
way
of
pointing
out
that
Mormon
was
the
name
of
the
major
editor
of
the
book
and
it
was
named
after
him
although
he
did
not
write
the
whole
book
Whether
Mormon
was
historical
figure
or
fictional
Character
is
matter
of
faith
but
many
of
the
names
in
the
book
do
have
roots
in
Near
Estern
languages
for
whatever
reason
Several
of
the
personal
names
in
the
book
are
popular
boys'
names
amongst
Mormon
families
today;
especially
popular
are
Jared
(which
is
also
the
name
of
an
obscure
Biblical
personage
but
the
Book
of
Mormon
character
has
far
greater
profile)
Helaman
and
Nephi
Current
place
names
in
Utah
that
come
from
the
Book
of
Mormon
include:
Bountiful
Lehi
Nephi
Manti
Moroni
and
Deseret
(town
not
the
territory)
There
are
numerous
Biblical
names
as
well:
Paradise
Jordan
River
West
Jordan
Goshen
Ephraim
Zion
National
Park
Joseph
Mount
Carmel
and
Moab
as
well
as
places
named
after
early

and
settlers
Brigham
City
Grantsville
Heber
City
and
others
The
Jordan
River
is
so
called
because
the
geography
of
Utah
resembles
that
of
Palestine:
Lake
Utah
drains
via
the
Jordan
River
into
the
Great
Salt
Lake
just
as
the
Sea
of
Galilee
drains
via
the
Jordan
River
into
the
salty
Dead
Sea
Old
World
Zion
and
New
World
Zion
are
thus
mirror
images
of
each
other
The
names
of
two
towns
American
Fork
and
Spanish
Fork
bear
special
mention
because
of
peculiarity
of
Utah
pronunciation
especially
rural
pronunciation:
locally
these
towns
are
known
as
American
Fark
and
Spanish
Fark
respectively
An
intriguing
example
of
Book
of
Mormon
place
name
is
Desert
which
was
very
popular
name
in
Mormondom
in
the
19th
century
Utah
was
not
allowed
to
enter
the
Union
until
long
after
it
had
achieved
the
minimum
requirements
for
statehood
(1896)
because
Americans
at
the
time
abhorred
the
Mormon
practice
of
polygamy
(called
plural
marriage
in
Latter-day
English)
Having
more
than
one
wife
was
all
right:
Gentiles
(nonMormons)
just
disapproved
of
having
them
all
at
the
same
time!
Speaking
of
Gentiles
there
is
story
(perhaps
apocryphal)
that
the
famous
Israeli
general
and
archaeologist
Yigael
Yadin
once
prefaced
speech
at
the
University

observation
You

The
territory
that
preceded
the
state
of
Utah
(named
after
the
Ute
Indians)
was
called
the
Territory
of
Desert
It
is
term
for
the
promised
land
in
the
Book
of
Mormon
and
is
supposed
to
mean
land
of
the
honeybee
It
has
been
speculated
that
the
word
is
related
to
the
Egyptian
dârt
term
for
the
Red
Crown
of
Upper
Egypt
whose
emblem
was
the
bee
In
the
19th
century
these
was
Deseret
Industries
The
hive
is
the
symbol
of
Utah
and
appears
on
its
coat-of-arms
The
territory
of
Desert
covered
an
area
much
larger
than
the
modern-day
state
of
Utah:
parts
of
Nevada
California
Arizona
Idoho
Wyoming
and
Colorado
were
all
part
of
Desert
at
one
time
non-contiguous
part
of
the
Mormon
empire
is
Mormon
Country
an
area
of
southern
Alberta
Canada
which
was
settled
by
Mormons
in
the
late
19th
century
refugees
from
US
marshals
looking
for
polygamists)
Several
doctrinal
terms
bear
mentioning
Mormons
(or
Latter-day
Saints
as
well
call
ourselves-not
out
of
sense
of
spiritual
superiority
it
is
to
be
hoped
but
because
of
reference
of
St
Paul's
to
the
members
of
the
ancient
church
being
called
saints)
have
two
basic
types
of
religious
buildings:
chapels
and
temples
and
they
are
as
different
as
synogogues
and
temples
are
in
Judaism
chapel
is
meeting
house
but
the
area
of
assembly
for
worship
withinthe
chapel
building
is
alson
called
chapel
Traditionally
there
is
also
cultural
hall
which
serves
as
everything
from
an
overflow
for
the
chapel
basketball
court
an
area
for
dramatic
and
musical
productions
and
hall
for
wedding
receptions
The
main
Sunday
meeting
the
counterpart
to
Catholic
mass
is
called
sacrament
meeting
sacrament
in
the
Mormon
sense
being
one
specific
sacrament
only:
what
other
christians
called
the
Eucharist
temple
is
building
where
as
rule
no
meetings
are
held
but
where
Mormons
go
for
certain
ceremonies
including
vicarious
ordinances
(ordinances
on
be
half
of
one's
ancestors)
for
celestial
marriages
(technically
celestial
marriage
is
the
institution
of
marriage
that
extends
past
death
as
generally
understood
and
the
wedding
ceremony
itself
is
called
temple
marriage
)
and
place
where
one
receives
one's
endowment
An
endowment
in
this
case
is
ceremony
at
which
one
ritualizes
one's
place
in
the
universe
both
with
respect
to
God
and
with
respect
to
one's
extended
family
There
are
also
tabernacles
which
are
large
meeting
places
for
special-purpose
meetings-the
best-known
one
is;
of
course
the
tabernacle
where
the
Mormon
Tabernacle
Choir
is
based
on
Temple
Square
in
Salt
Lake
City
When
Joseph
Smith's
successor
Brigham
Young
founded
Desert/Utah
he
sent
colonists
out
to
places
as
far
away
as
Colonia
Juarez
Mexico;
Cardston
Alberta
Canada;
San
Bernardino
California
and
all
over
Wyoming
Idoho
Nevada
and
Arizona
All
of
these
colonies
were
set
up
in
the
same
way
with
streets
wide
enough
to
ensure
full
team
of
oxen
could
turn
around
The
towns
were

presious
Mormon
colonies
in
the
estern
states
(Kirtland
Ohio
and
Nauvoo
Illinois)
were
into
stakes
and
words
The
image
of
the
stake
comes
from
the
stakes
used
to
hold
up
the
tabernacle
in
Old
Testament
days;
today
it
corresponds
roughly
to
diocese
and
is
collection
of
words
The
word
started
out
as
political
subdivision
just
like
wards
in
most
North
American
cities
but
became
the
equivalent
of
parish
Stakes
are
headed
by

(there
is
no
professional
clergy)
and
wards
are
headed
by
bishop
All
males
from
twelve
years
of
age
are
eligible
to
hold
the
priesthood
ant
it
is
this
semi-universal
priesthood
that
governs
the
church
(with
participation
by
women
in
some
administrative
roles
but
outside
the
context
of
the
priesthood
itself)
and
conducts
its
rituals
The
priesthood
is
divided
into
the
Aaronic
Priesthood
for
young
men
from
twelve
to
eighteen
and
the
Melchizedek
Priesthood
for
adult
males
Each
branch
is
divided
into
three
offices:
Decons
are
12-13;
Teachers
are
14-15;
Priest
are
16-17;
and
the
Melchizedek
Priesthood
is
divided
horizontally
into
three
offices:
Elders
(you
might
have
met
some
awfully

Elders

Seventies
and

Priests
The
imagery
comes
from
the
time
when
Moses
went
up
Mt
Sinai
leaving
group
of
seventy
at
one
point
and
the
edlers
of
Israel
behind
them
Moses
himself
was

Slang
terms
unofficial
terms
and
humour
abounds
within
Mormondom
The
humour
column
of
an
unofficial
scholarly
publication
Sunstone
in
called
Oxymormons
Women
are
referred
to
institutionally
as
the
Relief
Society
after
the
name
of
their
auxiliary
organization
(founded
by
Joseph
Smith's
wife
Emma
it
claims
to
be
America's
oldest
women's
organization)
To
hold
the
priesthood
is
euphemism
for
any
sort
of
physical
affection
displayed
by
women
towards
men
(since
all
men
at
least
in
principle
are
members
of
the
priesthood);
the
Word
of
Wisdom
is
reference
to
Mormons'
dietary
laws
(which
prohibit
smoking
alcohol
drugs
and
caffeine-containing
hot
drinks);
Primary
is
reference
to
children
up
to
the
age
of
eleven
(as
with
the
Relief
Society
this
is
an
example
of
the
name
of
the
organization
being
extended
generally
to
its
members)
Mormonism
has
relatively
well-defined
theology
but
even
in
such
centralized
body
of
thought
there
is
bound
to
be
specturm
of
beliefs
and
social
attitudes
What
Gentiles
would
call
liberals
and
called
liahonas
by
Mormons
and
conservatives
are
called
iron-rodders
both
terms
coming
from
Book
of
Mormon
images
And
finally
what
about
splinter
groups
without
which
no
self-respecting
religious
group
would
be
complete?
Mormons
who
do
not
practice
their
religion
are
called
Jack
Mormons
the
largest
schismatic
group
The
Reorganized
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latter
Day
Saints
(note
the
difference
in
spelling
of
latter-day)
who
did
not
follow
what
they
call
the
Utah
Mormons
out
west
but
stayed
in
Missouri
are
called
Reorganites
and
although
Mormons
have
their
share
of
fundamentalists
to
call
someone
fundamentalist
in
Mormondom
is
to
accuse
him
of
being
closet
polygamist
The
practice
of
polygamy
was
outlawed
just
before
the
turn
of
the
century
but
polygamous
families
persist
down
to
the
present
day
One
has
to
admit
these
terms
represent
an
improvement
over
one
term
that
used
to
be
applied
to
Missourians
during
the
days
of
persecution
in
the
mid-19th
century
(the
Missouri
state
legislature
still
had
an
official
Mormon
extermination
order
on
its
books
until
someone
discovered
it
in
the
archives
in
the
1970s):

The
Meaning
of
Murder
In
the
1991
Gulf
War
supporters
of
Saddam
Hussien
cheered
when
SCUD
missile
fell
on
Tel
Aviv
calling
George
Bush
murderer
for
having
bombed
Baghdad
At
the
same
time
supporters
of
George
Bush
who
had
cheered
when
US
planes
bombed
Baghdad
called
Saddam
Hussein
murderer
for
bombing
Tel
Aviv
Both
sides
agreed
on
what
they
meant
by
the
word
murderer
mut
they
made
opposite
judgments
as
to
whom
it
applied
and
why
How
is
that
possible
and
what
does
it
tell
us
about
how
language
works?
Murder
differs
from
kill
in
involving
the
notion
of
justification
To
say
that
one
person
kills
another
is
to
say
that
the
first
deprives
the
second
of
life;
but
to
say
that
person
murders
another
is
to
say
the
depriving
is
unjustified
This
raises
the
questions
What
does
justified
mean
and
How
does
one
justify
judgments
about
it?
Justified
falls
among
class
of
words
that
also
includes
what
linguists
call
modals
the
most
notable
of
these
are
must
should
and
can
Despite
their
apparent
definiteness
the
meanings
of
such
words
involve
an
element
of
indeterminacy
that
someewhat
resembles
ambiguity
Must
assets
that
there
are
laws
and
facts
that
jointly
necessitate
some
occurrence
either
already
completed
or
yet
to
be
brought
about
without
specifying
exactly
what
those
laws
and
facts
are
For
example
the
context
in
which
sentence
(1)
originally
appears
makes
it
clear
that
the
author
intends
it
to
express
historical
necessity
already
in
place
based
on
the
law
that
time
moves
forward
and
on
the
fact
that
lot
of
time
has
passed

However
the
sentence
could
just
as
well
have
appeared
in
government
report
expressing
an
admonition
to
keep
the
numbers
secret
based
on
the
fact
that
numbers
of
such
magnitude
would
anger
the
slaves'
descendents
and
on
an
assumed
law
to
the
effect
that
sufficient
provocation
caused
people
to
rebel
Neither
must
itself
nor
the
sentence
as
whole
provides
the
slightest
clue
as
to
which
of
these
inter
pretation
is
intended
Only
the
context
makes
that
clear
Should
means
the
same
as
must
except
that
it
leaves
room
for
loopholes
that
avoid
the
asserted
necessity
in

or
unusual
circumstances

(2)
and
(3)

and

interpretations
(2)
Although
precise
figures
should
remain
elusive
(under
normal
circumstances)
major
new
discoveries
of
slave-holders'
journals
and
artifacts
will
enable
us
to
compute
exact
totals

Although

Can

to

in
being
what
logicians
call
its
dual
Whereas
must
says
there

that

some

can
asserts
that
whatever
laws
and
facts

some
occurrence
is
permitted
(or
possible)
One
consequence
of
this
relation
is
the
fact
that
though
can
and
must
have
very
different
meanings
cannot
and
must
not
are
synonymous
For
example
(4)
has
can
where

the

on
the
fact
that

Thoses
who
cheered

instead
of
calling

based
their
judgment
on

In
fact
trans-alphabetism
to
coin
an
appropriate
neolo-
gism
goes
hand
in
hand
with
the
history
of
writing
The
first
known
graphic
system
cuneiform
served
as
the
common
vehicle
of
expression
for
not
only
Sumerian
Akkadian
Babylonian
Assyrian
and
Ugaritic
but
also
Elamite
Hurrian
Old
Persian
and
Hittite
Much
later
the
Greeks
borrowed
foreign
alphabet
Phoenician
and
adapted
it
to
their
needs
The
Greek
alphabet
was
in
turn
used
with
modifications
by
the
Lykians
Lydians
Etruscans
Copts
and
Slavs
Transformed
by
the
Romans
into
the
Latin
alphabet
it
has
since
become
the
most
widely
used
writing
system
ever
in
the
history
of
mankind
Alongside
these
examples
of
mainstream
transalphabetism
are
other
lesser-known
curiosities
From
antiquity
many
such
chameleonic
switchovers
are
preserved
on
papyrus
parchment
stone
and
bone
and
in
clay
Greek
letters
serving
to
write
Demotic
Egyptian
Babylonian
Hebrew
Aramaic
Indian
and
Latin
Conversely
Demotic
Egyptian
signs
and
Hebrew
Armenian
and
Latin
letters
were
sometimes
used
to
write
Greek
Such
trans-alphabetic
texts
are
approximate
phonetic
productions
written
by
or
for
someone
interested
in
but
not
capable
of
reading
particular
language
in
its
proper
alphabet
Thus
numerous
trans-alphabetic
glossariesâGreek-Latin
LatinGreek
Hebrew-Latin
Arabic-Coptic
and
ArabicGreekâonce
thought
to
be
schoolboys'
exercises
are
probably
elementary
aids
for
tourists
pilgrims
and
businessmen
Even
in
10th-century
Europe
it
was
fashionable
to
write
Latin
texts
employing
Greek
letters
Greek
being
far
more
holy
language
than
mundane
Latin
Yet
in
Greek
documents
notaries
appended
their
names
and
formulaic
closing
statements
using
Latin
letters
Furthermore
magicians
deliberately
wrote
such
trans-alphabetic
words
and
texts
on
amulets
in
order
to
project
an
aura
of
mystery
and
impress
credulous
clientele
Thus
one
finds
Egyptian
Hebrew
Aramaic
Greek/Latin
and
other
languages
disguised
in
Greek

Likewise
Hebrew
was
written
in
phonetic
Coptic
Alongside
these
more
pragmatic
productions
trans-alphabetic
texts
are
even
found
lurking
in
literature
both
ancient
and
modern

Apart
from
these
curiosities
are
the
many
quite
standard
instances
of
scripts
serving
to
reproduce
languages
with
which
they
have
no
organic
relationship
whatsoever
Middle
Persian
(an
Indo-European
language)
was
written
in
form
of
Aramaic
(a

Modern

is
expressed
in
Arabic
(Semitic)
letters
Yet
Maltese

is
written
not
in
Arabic
but

Turkish
which
is
neither
Semitic
nor
Indo-European
was
written
using
Arabic
letters
until
1928
when
Kemal
Ataturk
decreed
that
it
thenceforth
be
written
in
Latin
letters
Other
ancient
Turkic
languages
as
Arabic
and
Malayalam
in
India
were
sometimes
written
using
Syriac
(Semitic)
characters

The
Copts

letters;
today
they
read
their

in

Chinese
logographs
have
been
employed
for

and
Annamese
However
present-day
Vietnamese
uses
Latin

as
do
many
African
Asian
Polynesian

around
the

If
the
ancient

were
to
meet

In
her
delightful
study
Theories
of
Discourse
Diane
Macdonell
describes
how
after
the
French
revolution
the
bourgeois
came
to
realize
that
if
the
lower
orders
took
seriously
the
slogan
LibertÃ©
EgalitÃ©
FraternitÃ©
their
wealth
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
wrong
people
The
solution
to
the
problem
was
straightforward
Teach
everyone
French
as
if
it
were
Latin
The
results
were
working
class
who
could
read
directions
but
not
compose
well-formed
composition
in
their
complicated
native
tongue
and
an
educated
class
who
got
to
the
university
used
French
as
they
had
learned
it
at
their
mother's
knee
(naturally
not
as
they
had
been
taught
it
in
school)
and
made
good
use
of
the
grammatical
rules
they
had
been
taught
by
applying
them
to
their
study
of
Latin
nicely
dead
and
therefore
reasonably
systematizable
language
The
British
who
didn't
go
through
the
dislocation
(and
revivification)
of
revolution
simple
allowed
the
gentry
to
establish
the
colloquial
norm
for
those
who
counted
themselves
among
the
educated
and
mined
the
literature
for
texts
to
constitute
canon
that
would
be
taught
as
stylistic
and
as
by-product
grammatical
model
The
result
was
respect
for
proper
English
that
is
to
say
the
English
spoken
by
proper
gentlemen
All
bit
authoritarian
but
reasonable
The
effectiveness
of
the
policy
can
be
seen
by
making
quick
analysis
of
the
language
spoken
by
Oliver
Twist:
Dickens
qua
social
reformer
knew
perfectly
well
that
if
Oliver
hadn't
somehow
come
to
speak
the
Queen's
English
he
wouldn't
have
made
it
(One
might
add
in
passing
that
the
twentieth-century
establishmentarian
feathers
ruffled
by
D
H
Lawrence
with
Lady
Chatterley's
Lover
were
less
the
result
of
Mellors'
seducing
member
of
the
aristocracy
than
his
not
addressing
her
properly.)
This
latest
trend
to
make
use
of
vast
corpus
of
linguistic
data
as
way
to
democratize
the
understanding
of
language
isâand
think
here
you
and
quite
agreeâa
gross
mistake
Not
only
does
it
throw
out
the
concept
of
good
English
but
it
establishes
the
norms
of
language
on
what's
said
(This
is
an
expression
frequently
used
by
my
British
colleagues
and
one
that
in
my
opinion
is
as
silly
as
basing
legal
system
on
what's
done.)
Not
long
ago
when
suggestedâfor
passage
chosen
for
our
entrance
examâthat
an
it
that
referred
back
to
an
unstipulated
topic
of
previous
paragraph
be
changed
to
this
was
told
that
there's
no
need
to
be
so
picky
because
it's
said
The
consequences
of
this
(not
it
have
not
been
such
salutary
effects
as
broadening
of
acceptable
usage
or
loosening
of
the
traditional
schoolmaster's
authority
over
what
constitutes
proper
English
or
diminution
of
class
consciousness
The
resultsâperhaps
totally
unforeseenâhave
rather
been
shift
in
linguistic
authority
away
from
the
gentry
and
Oxbridgians
to
the
media
The
consequences
of
all
this
are
fascinating
We
who
are
in
control
of
the
media
and
therefore
aware
of
the
context
in
which
unclear
English
is
used
know
what's
going
on
(and
therefore
the
meanings
of
the
utterances
used
to
describe
it)
while
the
vulgar
(to
use
Berkeley's
delightful
expression
for
those
with
shaky
grasp
of
vocabulary
and
syntax
who
are
therefore
ill
equipped
to
understand
some
particular
bit
of
newspeak)
are
led
to
believe
when
they
fail
to

Greenbaum
in
his
Grammar
with
its
democratic
what's
said
corpus-based
approach
to
language
unwittingly
am
quite
sure
keeps
the
really
proper
use
of
English
in
the
hands
of
those
who
are
to
the
manner
born
while
allowing
the
media
moguls
to
interpret
or
misinterpret
the
topics
of
public
concern
as
they
will
and
at
the
same
time
disallowing
the
vulgar
from
gaining
firm
grasp
on
the
means
by
which
they
might
enter
the
debate
We
have
here
delightfully
constructed
catch-22:
if
you
don't
study
your
grammar
you're
uneducated;
if
you
do
you've
been
exposed
to
proper
education
by
your
kindly
school
system;
but
when
you
use
one
of
your
grammar
book's
dreadfully
improper
constructions
as
model
you
place
yourself
in
the
class
of
the
obviously
simple-minded
whose
opinions
are
irrelevant
And
please
notice:
when
we
use
the
word
class
here
we
do
so
not
at
all
in
social
senseâoh
dear
me
noâbut
strictly
in
an
intellectual
one
If
you
don't
know
the
difference
between
the
appropriate
contexts
in
which
to
use
two
examples
placed
one
after
the
other
in
your
grammar
book
it's
consequence
of
your
mind's
incapacity
to
grasp
how
things
ought
to
be
correctly
expressed
not
that
you've
had
the
misfortune
of
being
born
into
the
working
class
(To
what
extent
this
is
conscious
agenda
on
the
part
of
the
establishment
and
how
much
it
is
simply
an
ill-conceived
educational
policy
is
matter
for
further
inquiry.)
Rather
than
focusing
our
attention
on
the
establishment
of
universally
applicable
rules
of
grammar
as
way
to
make
more
democratic
society
we
might
better
develop
more
holistic
semiotically
based
curriculum
that
points
our
young
in
the
direction
of
clear
thinking
take
Peirce
to
be
right
when
he
tells
us
that
meaning
(and
therefore
correct
usage
in
the
broadest
sense)
is
always
inseparable
from
context
And
given
that
fact
would
argue
that
as
long
as
the
educational
system
teaches
dictionary
definitions
as
giving
lexical
meaning
and
grammatically
proper
structures
as
carrying
grammatically
meaning
we
will
have
(as
we
do
now)
the
vast
bulk
of
our
population
functionally
illiterate
The
subset
of
semiosis
calledâperhaps
misleadinglyâ
language
comes
into
being
when
there
is
will
to
share
(Searle
would
call
it
an
intention.)
It
works
when
those
involved
share
common
experience
common
set
of
general
rules
for
their
communication
game
and
common
aim
for
their
dialogue
It
happens
best
when
the
experience
has
the
broadest
possible
horizon
the
rules
are
supplemented
by
good
style
and
the
aims
are
the
achievement
of
the
best
possible
degree
of
understanding
To
give
short
shrift
to
any
of
these
three
facets
of
communication
is
to
tear
apart
the
fabric
of
dialogue
Too
much
buck-passing
(usually
in
the
name
of
scientific
rigor)
between
the
experts
on
language
literature
and
history
has
resulted
in
the
sad
fact
that
clear
thought
the
mortar
that
serves
to
create
integrated
human
interaction
has
been
quite
consistently
assigned
to
the
other
guy's
bailiwick
School
systems
teach
systems
But
that
can't
be
the
end
of
the
matter
The
process
that
Bakhtin
calls
Dialogue
is
ultimately
context
based
and
not
system
based
This
is
why
for
example
the
expression
The
teacher
has
it
in
for
me
falls
through
the
cracks
of
lexicon
and
grammar
The
sentence
doesn't
mean
what
the
words
mean
and
if
they
did
why
is
the
verb
have
it
in
for
defective?
I've
never
heard
it
used
in
the
first
person
nor
one
might
add
with
the
Pope
as
subject
Students
would
learn
ten
times
more
about
words
and
how
they
are
used
if
instead
of
being
asked
to
remember
what
is
grammatically
or
lexically
correct
they
were
asked
in
class
to
play
roles
such
as
shoe
salesmen
or
lords
of
the
manor
and
by
doing
so
got
feel
for
what
is
said
by
such
people
in
such
dialoguesânot
just
what
is
said
but
what
is
said
in
such
by
such
people
dialogues
This
kind
of
contextual
sensitivity
(a
sensitivity
that
is
as
yet
not
sufficiently
well
understood)
is
far
more
important
than
that
sort
of
abstract
knowledge
of
the
proper
use
of
language
that
prompts
certain
of
us
to
shiver
at
someone
else's
stumbling
over
shibboleth
Needless
to
say
the
idea
of
abstract
knowledge
isn't
all
that
simple
How
much
of
what
passes
from
Knowing
grammar
is
in
fact
remembering
what
was
said
at
home
or
by
an
author
one
has
read?
Are
grammatical
rules
explanations
of
what
is
said
by
people
like
us?
If
they
are
how
does
the
learning
of
them
help
someone
who
doesn't
speak
like
us?
Does
child
learn
to
walk
by

the
musculature

at

have
studied
English

well
over
half-dozen
years

they

they

answer
Yes

with

this
should
not
be
construed
as
lack
of
grammatical
comprehension
since
if
they
don't
know
the
way
they
invariably
answer
I'm
sorry.)
Somehow
the
proper
understanding
of
how
we
function
semiotically
(I'm
trying
to
avoid
the

for
now)
needs
to
be

The

the

it

of
observations
in
the
review
whether
Strauss's
or
Mertvago's
strike
me
as
dubious
at
best
and
the
translation
of
an
example
as
misleading
do
not
agree
that
the
relative
brevity
of
many
Russian
proverbs
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
Russian
language
has
no
articles
and
also
resorts
idiomatically
to
participial
condensation
by
not
using
oblique
forms
of
the
verb
to
be
What

participle
of

Russian
verb

No
the
form
of
the
Russian
verb
for
to
be
that
is
usually
(but
not
always)
omitted
is
the
present
tense
as
sometimes
in
English:
Terrific
guy
that
Tom!
This
omission
and
the
absence
of
articles
does
lend
certain
pithiness
to
Russian

think
that
the
apparent
brevity
which
depends
in
part
on
whether
you
count
words
or
syllables
is
due
much
more
to
the
heavy
inflection
of
Russian
that
compresses
meaning
in
single
words
The
best
example
of
this
kind
of
semantic
compression
that
occurs
to
me
is
from
Latin
language
that
in
many
respects
is
grammatically
similar
to
Russian:
Romae
romane
which
comes
to
us
in
English
as
When
in
Rome
do
as
the
Romans
do
In
Russian
can
squeeze
this
down
to
Ryme-po-rymski
But
then
in
English
one
can
come
pretty
close
to
both
the
Latin
meaning
and
brevity
with
say
In
Rome
act
(or
be)
Roman
Running
English
proverbs
and
sayings
through
my
mind
seem
to
find
that
although
our
language
has
the
resources
to
be
fairly
pithy
we
are
not
as
attracted
to
pithiness
as
Russians
and
Romans
What
bothers
me
more
however
is
the
translation
of
the
Russian
proverb
Chemu
Vanya
nye
nauchilsya
tovo
Ivan
nye
vyuchit
Literally
leaving
out
the
tovo
as
redundant
in
English
this
proverb
means
What
Johnnie
hasn't
learnt
John
won't
learn
Just
as
in
English
the
nickname
Johnnie
implies
youth
so
the
Russian
nickname
Vanya
implies
boyhoodâbut
only
implies:
Uncle
Vanya
was
not
youngâwhile
the
formal
names
John/Ivan
imply
maturity
By
overloading
the
proverb
with
little
and
old
in
What
little
Johnnie
hasn't
learnt
old
John
will
not
learn
the
translator
(here
traditore
indeed)
has
killed
the
clever
implication
inherent
in
the
play
on
names
perhaps
in
fumbled
attempt
to
bear
out
his
claim
that
Russian
proverbs
are
relatively
brief
Maybe
am
nitpicking
though
The
statement
that
Generally
speaking
the
Russians
make
greater
use
of
proverbs
than
the
Americans
or
the
British
is
doubtless
true
with
the
consequence
that
the
careful
attention
given
Mertvago's
compilation
is
quite
justified
As
for
me
hope
that
my
nitpicking
through
the
articles
you
publish
in
VERBATIM
demonstrates
the
consideration
think
due
these
articles
rather
than
envy
and
pedantry
found
the
following
article
by
my
grandfather
Professor
Walter
W
Skeat
among
some
of
his
papers
The
justification
for
reprinting
it
would
be
that
although
find
his
explanation
totally
convincing
it
is
not
to
be
found
either
in
the
original
edition
of
the
OED
under
the
word
dear
to
which
he
refers
or
in
the
revised
edition
published
in
1989
OH!
DEAR!
It
must
have
struck
many
that
the
very
common
phrase
Oh!
dear
is
after
all
very
senseless
expression
When
we
come
to
try
to
read
sense
into
it
some
might
think
that
it
may
be
contracted
from
some
longer
expression
such
as
Oh!
dear
me
But
this
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
evidence
The
earliest
known
example
of
Dear
me
is
no
older
than
1773
whilst
Oh
dear
occurs
as
early
as
1694
and
is
the
earliest
known
phrase
in
which
dear
occurs
at
all
Dr
Murray
remarks
[in
Volume
IV
of
the
New
English
Dictionary
1897
s.v
dear]
that
several
phrases
occur
such
as
dear
save
us
in
1719
dear
knows
in
1876
dear
help
you
in
1880
and
the
like
which
suggest
that
dear
represents
or
implies
fuller
dear
Lord
thus
dear
knows
is
equivalent
to
the
Lord
knows
and
so
on
But
he
adds
very
justly
that
derivation
from
Ital
Dio
God
resting
upon
the
modern
English
pronunciation
of
dear
finds
no
support
in
the
history
of
the
word
wish
to
draw
attention
to
two
ascertained
facts
The
first
is
that
the
particular
phrase
Oh
dear!
is
the
earliest
of
the
set
as
has
been
already
remarked;
and
secondly
that
there
is
no
trace
whatever
even
in
dialects
of
fuller
form
like
dear
Lord
If
we
are
to
go
by
the
evidence
we
must
recognise
that
the
interpretation
of
dear
by
dear
Lord
or
even
by
Lord
at
all
is
due
to
the
influence
of
popular
etymology
which
could
make
nothing
of
dear
when
it
stood
alone
think
it
is
equally
clear
that
we
must
dismiss
all
thoughts
of
connecting
its
origin
with
the
Italian
Dio
will
now
go
step
further
and
assert
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
for
connecting
it
with
the
adjective
dear
at
all!
It
makes
no
sense
as
we
may
see
by
little
thought
For
dear
means
beloved
affectionate
precious
and
the
like;
but
the
exclamation
Oh!
dear!
is
one
that
denotes
something
very
different
something
that
is
lamentable
or
calamitous
and
very
far
from
being
pleasant
Thus
in
1694
Congreve
makes
one
of
his
characters
sayâOh!
dear!
you
make
me
blush!
In
1769
we
findâOh
dear!
oh
dear!
how
melancholy
has
been
to
me
this
last
week!
And
againâ
Oh!
dear!
shall
die!
And
in
Goldsmith's
She
Stoops
to
Conquer
Miss
Hardcastle
saysâDear
me!
Dear
me!
I'm
sure
there's
nothing
in
my
behaviour
to
put
me
on
level
with
one
of
that
stamp
If
we
will
only
for
moment
consider
this
probability
viz
that
there
is
no
good
reason
for
associating
this
interjectional
phrase
with
well-known
adjective
this
will
leave
us
free
to
look
around
us
and
see
whether
any
other
source
is
possible
And
if
we
do
this
we
have
not
to
look
far
The
phrase
for
instance
makes
no
good
sense
in
English;
and
this
affords
presumption
that
it
was
borrowed
from
abroad
And
whenever
we
consider
the
possibility
of
borrowing
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
our
first
thoughts
turn
as
matter
of
course
to
France
Let
us
see
what
French
will
do
for
us
now
venture
to
quote
some
remarkable
words
from
Cotgrave's
well-known
Dictionary
and
from
the
Old
French
Dictionary
by
Godefroy
Cotgrave
has:â
DeÃ¢
an
interjection
as
DÃ¢
ouy
de^
[the
circumflex
over
the
is
not
mine
but
Cotgrave's]
yes
truly
verily
without
doubt
also
tearme
of
expostulation
[note
this];
as
deÃ¢
qui
vous
mouvoit
why
or
good
God
what
reason
had
you?
or
what
God's
name
moved
you?
It
should
particularly
be
remarked
that
the
sense
coincides
exactly
with
that
of
the
English
phrase
We
can
translate
this
literally
by
sayingâDear
dear!
who
put
you
up
to
it?
It
is
note
of
expostulation
as
Cotgrave
truly
says;
and
it
indicates
despair
rather
than
hope
Godefroy
has:â
Dea
dia
dya
da
sort
of
exclamation
of
astonishment
His
examples
show
that
it
was
sometimes
preceded
by
the
interjection
he
[illegible
character]
as
HÃ©
dia!
or
HÃ©!
dea
which
is
suggestive
of
the
English
phrase
It
was
usually
employed
as
in
English
to
imply
lamentation
or
disaster
as
e.g
HÃ©
dea!
quand
je
fus
nÃ©
quelle
mauditte
estoille
presida
dessus
moy;
i.e
Oh!
dear!
what
an
evil
star
presided
over
my
birth
Dea!
quel
desastre
est
ce
qui
regne
en
France!
i.e
Dear!
what
disaster
prevails
in
France!
It
served
also
as
Cotgrave
notes
to
enforce
an
affirmation
as
in
Ouy
dea
dis
je;
Yes
forsooth
say
I
It
is
worth
while
trying
to
guess
whence
this
expression
came
We
notice
that
Cotgrave
writes
it
with
circumflex
over
the
as
if
it
were
contracted
form
It
is
remarkable
that
the
chief
word
which
in
Old
French
began
with
dea-
or
dia
is
the
too
common
word
deable
or
diable
the
use
of
which
in
expressions
of
lamentation
is
so
prevalent
both
in
French
and
English
It
really
seems
as
if
the
true
sense
of
Oh
dear!
were
Oh!
the
devil!
The
clipping
of
swearwords
is
common
phenomenon
If
this
be
so
the
exclamation
Dear
knows
may
have
originated
in
phrase
which
meant
the
devil
knows
But
as
this
interpretation
was
not
at
all
obvious
or
was
forgotten
the
familiarity
of
many
Englishmen
with
the
Span
Dios
and
the
Ital
Dio
may
really
have
suggested
new
interpretation
in
the
eighteenth
century;
indeed
even
Cotgrave
seems
to
have
had
such
notion
For
the
earliest
example
of
Dear
save
us
is
no
earlier
than
1719;
whilst
on
the
other
hand
the
use
of
dea
occurs
in
Rabelais
and
Godefroy
in
his
supplement
quotes
the
phrase
Dya
dya
houoih
hau
dia
i.e
Dear
dear!
houoih
Oh
dear!
from
book
dated
1561
This
O.F
dea
later
dia
seems
to
be
modern
F
da
The
O.F
disva
diva
i.e
come
along
is
clearly
quite
different
word
Finally
we
may
notice
that
the
double
form
dea
dia
will
suit
either
the
old
or
the
modern
pronunciation
of
the
English
dear
so
that
phonetic
requirements
are
fulfilled
either
way

Contradiction

Given
that

the
world's
principal
form
of
communication
we
can
perhaps
be

for

ourselves
up

so
good

we
do
it
daily
assuming

Calendrical
Sentence
Many
years
ago
came
across
meaningful
sentence
attributed
to
Rabindranath
Tagore
the
only
Indian
writer
to
win
the
Nobel
Prize:
Worship
God
and
attain
soul
devoid
of
anger
passion
and
guilt
Memorize
this
sentence
because
it
is
not
only
meaningful
but
also
useful
in
that
it
will
enable
one
to
find
out
the
day
of
any
date
except
in
leap
years
The
sentence
has
twelve
words
Each
word
is
connected
with
each
month
respectively
that
is
worship
for
January
God
for
February
and
for
March
and
so
on
Here
is
the
method
to
apply
in
finding
the
day
of
any
date
of
any
year
except
leap
years
(Leap
years
are
easy
to
identify:
they
are
any
year
divisible
by
and
centuries
divisible
by
400:
thus
2000
will
be
leap
year
but
1900
was
not.)
India
became
independent
on
15
August
1947
To
find
the
day
of
the
week
on
which
that
date
fell
first
divide
1947
by
4:
the
answer
is
486
(with
remainder
of
3
which
should
be
ignored);
add
this
number:
1947
486
2433
Then
find
the
word
that
stands
for
August
the
eighth
monthâ
of
âand
add
the
number
of
its
letters:
2433
2435
Now
add
the
date
sought:
2435
15
2450
Divide
this
number
by
7:
2450
350
with
remainder
Now
the
days
of
the
week
are
numbered
through
6
beginning
with
Friday:
Friday;
Saturday;
Sunday;
Monday;
Tuesday;
Wednesday;
Thursday
Ergo
India's
Independence
Day
15
August
1947
fell
on
Friday
Take
another
example:

variants
on
the
following
tale:
Tradition
has
it
that
Yankee
farmer
or
fisherman
whose
wife
Anna
was
too
lazy
to
cook
for
him
concocted
the
recipe
On
tasting
the
result
of
his
[sic]
efforts
neighbor
asked
him
what
he
called
the
bread
The
crusty
Yankee
replied
Anna
damn
her!
There
are
other
genuine
New

expressions
in

plenty
of
themâincluding

can

in

dictionary
of

Frederic

including
as
it
happens
the
same
illustrative
quotations
used
in

Talk
plus
some
additional
ones
There
are
also
occasional
perhaps
disingenuous
puzzles
The
entry
for
chism
for
instance
which
reads
in

Heard

or
cream
sauce
It
would
be
useful
to
give
bit
more
information
for
the
guidance
of
the
innocent
and
unwary:
chism
is
variant
of
the
vulgar
slang
term
jism
or
gism
for
semen
so
in
the
reported
use
is
an
indelicate
metaphor
Readers
of
the
dictionary
should
be
warned
that
in
Bangor
restaurant
they
ought
not
ask
for
chism
with
their
roast
beef
The
problem
with
this
book
is
knowing
which
entries
are
genuine
and
which
spurious
To
make
that
discrimination
another

Vyvyan:

So
my
dear
despite
these
deafening
drapes
is
this
lucky
universe
or
what?
Cyril:
In
1974
Dr
Brandon
Carter
theoretical
physicist
at
MIT
posited
"the
Anthropic
Principle,"
asseverating
that
these
coincidences
were
not
just
luck
but
were
rather
necessary
preconditions
for
us
to
be
looking
at
the
universe
After
all
we
are
hardly
likely
to
discover
laws
that
are
incompatible
with
our
own
existence
Vyvyan:
Our
mission
Cyril:
contra
the
laws
promulgated
by
fundamentalists
as
in
Iran
or
the
United
States
Cyril:
How

Vyvyan

Freeman
Dyson

once
said
"The

Vyvyan:
Yep!
Cyril:
Dr
Steven
Weinberg
is
positively
Miltonic
in
his
comments
on
the
universe
which
he
sees
bubbling
progeny
like
yeast

According
to

Dr

of

the

Vyvyan:
My
own
economise

And
you
are
looking
trifle

yourself
Cyril:
Well
if
you
say
so
my
precious
little
fatty
Now
according
to
astronomical
observations
otherwise
undetectable
energy--"dark
energy"--
accounts
for
about
two-thirds
of
the
mass-energy
of
the
universe
today
outweighing
matter
two
to
one
But
according
to
modern
quantum
physics
empty
space
should
be
seething
with
energy
that
would
outweigh
matter
in
the
universe
by
far
far
more
by
factor
of
at
least
1060
Vyvyan:
And
what
to
wear
in
dark
energy?
So
the
speeding-up
of
inflation
lends
more
energy
than
was
thought
to
exist?
And
the
cosmological
constant,
formula
to
account
for
this
discrepancy
must
be
within
ranges
compatible
with
us!
Cyril:
Just
just
so
And
as
we
know
the
logical
consequence
of
this
is
that
we
"queers"
in
our
indolence
have
seen
through
the
canard
of
vulgar
Marxism
We
live
the
principle
that
production
is
not
the
basis
of
human
life.
Instead
it
is
enjoyment!
Fourier!
Vyvyan:
Ergo
my
dear
Cyril
what
all
we
humans
do
is
enjoy
the
impingement
of
this
probably-unique
world
on
us
and
ours

of
Prince
Felix
Youssopoff
the

queen

He

fled

Karen
managed
to
recover
her
grandfather's
Baku
oil
refineries
and
grew
richer
through
the
sale
of
his
Rembrandts
and
suit
against
CBS
Television
that
proved
her
grandfather
actually
did
murder
the
Czarina's
starets.15
She
reads
from
her
commonplace
book
makes
notation
in
her
crabbed
half-Cyrillic
hand
"The
productive-man
notion
of
Marx
'hallucinates
man's
predestination
for
the
objective
transformation
of
the
world
(or
for
the
'production'
of
oneself:
today's
generalized
humanist
theme--it
is
no
longer
question
of
'being'
oneself
but
of
'producing'
oneself
from
conscious
activity
to
the
primitive
'productions'
of
desire16"
Karen
dials
her
message
machine
to
leave
this
memorandum:
"B
quotes
Marx
for
whom
men
'begin
to
distinguish
themselves
from
animals
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
produce
their
means
of
subsistenceâ¦'
Remember
that."
She
asks
Merle
her
Maltese
"Why
must
man's
vocation
always
be
to
distinguish
himself
from
animals?
Is
man's
existence
an
end
for
which
he
must
find
the
means?"
Sliding
back
the
curtain
on
the
sidelight
of
the
door
little
Karen
critiques
the
notion
of
production
of
subsistence:
"it
is
the
instrumentalization
of
nature."
She
summons
up
Marx:
'Labor
is
in
the
first
place
process
in
which
both
man
and
nature
participate
and
in
which
man
of
his
own
accord
starts
regulates
and
controls
the
material
re-actions
between
himself
and
nature
He
opposes
himself
to
nature
as
one
of
her
own
forces
setting
in
motion
arms
and
legs
head
and
hands
the
natural
forces
of
his
body
in
order
to
appropriate
nature's
productions
in
form
adapted
to
his
own
wants.'17"
"How
tedious,"
Karen
sighs
"Why
can't
these
men
see
that
labor
is
not
the
basis
of
human
existence?
Even
Marcuse
for
all
his
slavering
after
erotic
freedom
says
labor
is
grounded
'in
an
essential
excess
of
human
existence
beyond
every
possible
situation
in
which
it
finds
itself
and
the
world
[it]
is
necessary
and
eternally
'earlier'
than
play:
it
is
the
starting
point
foundation
and
principle
of
play
insofar
as
play
is
precisely
breaking
off
from
labor
and
recuperation
for
labor.18'
But
that
is
so
wrong!"
Taking
her
own
version
of
luxury
in
an
Henri
III
(1551-1589)
straight-back
wooden
chair
Karen
tightens
her
black
toque
and
murmurs
"Marx
doesn't
see
that
in
his
symbolic
exchanges
primitive
man
(sic)
does
not
gauge
himself
in
relation
to
Nature
He
is
not
aware
of
Necessity
Law
that
takes
effect
only
with
the
objectification
of
Nature."
"Primitive
'society'
does
not
exist
as
an
instance
apart
from
symbolic
exchange;
and
this
exchange
never
results
from
an
'excess'
of
production
It
is
the
opposite:
to
the
extent
that
these
terms
apply
here
'subsistence'
and
'economic
exchange'
are
the
residue
of
symbolic
exchange
remainder.'
Impatiently
re-telling
her
jet
beads
she
thinks
"survival
is
not
principle
We
have
made
it
one."
She
remembers
Africa
and
her
other
lover
Jean
Baudrillard
saying
"For
the
primitives
eating
drinking
and
living
are
first
of
all
acts
that
are
exchanged:
if
they
are
not
exchanged
they
do
not
occur
It
is
symbolic
exchange
where
the
relation
(not
the
'social')
is
tied
and
this
exchange
excludes
any
surplus:
anything
that
cannot
be
exchanged
or
symbolically
shared
would
break
the
reciprocity
and
institute
power
Better
yet
this
exchange
excludes
all
'production.'"
"Good
old
Jean,"
she
sighs
"stealing
from
Bataille
like
that."
The

With

down
he
tells
Karen
he
is
at
her
service
"My
name
is
Ahmed
Oedipus
Ben
Maas,"
he
says
"and
for
me
'work'
is
something
other
than
laborâ¦The
artisan
lives
his
work
as
relation
of
symbolic
exchange
abolishing
the
definition
of
himself
as
'laborer'
and
the
object
as
'product
of
his
labor.'
"Above
all,"
Karen
adds
lighting

of

the

gash
of
her
mouth
"artisanal
work
is
according

One
Sunday
evening
I'm
relaxing
around
this
musty
French
pool
reminiscing
about
day
in
LA
in
1992
when
some
rich
queen
threw
pool
party
for
People
With
AIDS
up
in
the
hills
within
spitting
distance
of
the
Hollywood
Sign
Boys
with
purple
blotches
all
over
their
backs
and
chests
played
in
the
sunny
water
while
few
long-timers
sat
in
wheelchairs
wrapped
in
bright
blankets
wheeled
mushrooms
in
big
straw
hats
It
was
in
that
pool
that
met
Ferd
Ferd
was
not
the
host--he
had
no
more
money
than
it
takes
to
buy
used
Toyota
pickup--but
he
was
the
big
cheese
because
he
was
the
director
of
the
PWA
group
bubbling
on
the
lawn
with
precious--
tentative--joy
in
the
sunshine
We
all
loved
Ferd
then
He
was
healthy
enough
to
work
for
our
benefit
16
hours
day
he
was
edgy
enough
to
get
our
group
funded
at
the
vanguard
of
sexual
healing
as
both
treatment
and
prevention
strategy
Ferd
was
little
like
our
figurehead
as
we
breasted
the
waves
our
sun
king
as
he
ordered
the
world
with
and
for
us
and
little
like
social
director
who
under
his
bonhomie
was
transparently
terrified
of
friendship
He
slid
into
the
water
next
to
me
and
we
bobbed
up
and
down
smiling
and
cruising
trying
to
assure
myself
was
still
cute
and
attractive
Ferd
called
upon
to
concentrate
so
long
on
one
person
that
sexual
desire
snuck
up
on
him
unbidden--in
fact
he
would
later
say
unpermitted
in
his
job
as
director
and
animator
of
our
clump
of
radical
patients
and
victims
since
sexual
liaison
would
reduce
his
availability
to
"listen
handhold
inspire
cajole
hug
solace"
the
others
he
thought
in
his
care
That
afternoon
he
pulled
himself
out
of
the
pool
with
slight
turgidity
visible
in
the
folds
of
his
floppy
yellow
trunks
and
smiled
as
if
he
expected
to
be
back
to
bob
some
more
with
me
He
didn't
come
back
soon
not
until
after
fended
off
handsome
guy
with
really
bad

"We're
walking

door

The
Huxley
property
explained
our
host
was
really
just

Aldous

took
his
LSD
where
Laura
struggled
on

until
1979
The
Hollywood
Sign
was
so
close
that
the
OOD
took
up
most
of
the
view
on
one
side
Ferd
started
in
about
his
acid
trips
He
had
met
Leary
at
Millbrook
once
in
67
he
had
done
light
shows
at
the
Fillmore
with
Janis
Country
Joe
The
Incredible
String
Band
(one
of
his
fey
favorites)
Sly
and
the
Family
Stone
at
the
Electric
Circus
"I
wish
there
was
still
acid
to
be
taken,"
he
said
"now
that
I'm
not
scared
about
blurting
out
'I'm
gay'
to
some
straight
hippie
companion."
"That
must
have
happened
twenty
years
ago,"
replied
"Surely
you've
come
to
terms
with
all
of
that
by
now
After
all
here
we
are
all
together
having
fun
living
proof
that
God
doesn't
punish
the
wicked
with
anything
more
than
painful
ugly
death
and
stigmatized
suffering."
"Yes
surely
should
feel
cheered
by
your
reminder
of
how
good
we
have
it,"
Ferd
said
"But
let's
don't
call
each
other
Shirley
Actually
take
anti-depressants
now
so
don't
bother
with
scared
or
unhappy
any
more
"I
think
our
consciousness
should
be
altered
early
and
often."
he
told
me
his
good
eye
engaging
mine
"We
need
to
experience
being
without
relation
to
time--escape
from
conception
of
forward
moving
series
of
events
the
most
sense-rich
of
which
felt
as
the
present
and
less
rich
assigned
to
recallable
but
fading
past
Further
the
brain's
capacity
to
take
in
and
re-view
sensory
input
led
to
the
development
of
neural
pathways
that
could
access
and
perceive
or
experience
the
occurrence
of
review
and
cogitate
on
the
process
itself
Sensory
input
is
reviewed
through
the
same
neural
pathways
(or
analogous
or
related
or
proximate
ones)
that
process
raw
sensory
input
It
is
unclear
whether
the
brain
always
knows
the
difference
between
processing
the
sensory
input
we
usually
think
of
as
perception
of
reality
and
processing
the
processing
which
as
mirrors
can
reflect
each
other
can
approach
infinity
as
sense
data
become
perceptions
become
organized
ideas
become
abstract
categories
and
then
categories
of
categories
Given
what
little
is
understood
about
the
brain
it
is
not
possible
to
say
whether
these
processes
are
or
are
not
organized
in
hierarchies
The
brain
may
assign
more
or
less
attention
energy
ranking
by
importance
or
immediacy
or
proximity
or
some
other
order--or
not
"The
result
of
all
this
think
is
that
humans
have
brain
that
processes
sensory
and
internal
mental
phenomena
at
too
many
levels
too
often
too
much
with
inadequate
mechanism
to
turn
the
processing
off
We
have
brains
too
good
for
our
own
good;
we
think
and
abstract
feelings
and
memories
too
much
This
ceaseless
idling
is
what
we
have
learned
to
call
our
feelings
however
remote
the
neural
processing
may
be
from
somatic
reactions
to
events
perceived
as
happening
now
Like
HAL2000
our
brain
(and
by
brain
keep
trying
to
mean
all
the
data
processing
mechanisms
from
senses
to
memory
to
thinking)
thinks
what
it
does
is
real
What
psychological
literature
and
philosophy
have
always
confounded--the
subject
and
object
and
later
the
divided
subject--become
less
compelling
as
explanation
and
certainly
as
concept
to
provide
comfortable
relation
to
'external
reality.'
But
the
brain
is
best
seen
as
actively
seeking
processing
and
thinking
at
all
levels
simultaneously:
consciousness
is
trick
of
our
brains
describing
us
to
ourselves
stringing
processes
and
events
into
self
asserting
to
us
that
the
self
of
today
is
the
same
one
as
any
other
day
selecting
data
and
memories
to
substantiate
itself."
"Yeah
you're
right,"

Reception

While

in
at

Usually

as

on
Wild

she
would
be
irritable
in
pantsuit
that
barely
stretches
across
her
chest
and
chafes
her
crotch
Novy
might
be
musing
about
her
lover
or
daydreaming
about
her
brothers
She'd
not
be
impressed
by
the
small
bald
man
across
the
counter
signing
in
as
Mobe
68
"Will
you
be
needing
any
special
attentions
Mr
Mobe
68?"
"No
just
be
sure
my
car
is
plugged
in
to
the
charger
and
send
up
12
bottles
of
Vichy
water
And
put
Ferd
in
the
room
next
to
mine."
"Very
good
Mr
Mobe
68
And
here
are
the
keys
for
you
and
Mr
Ferd."
She
might
think
to
herself
that
these
two
were
pop
music
has-beens
from
2002;
she'd
put
them
in
the
smelly
suite
on
the
fourth
floor
"Overlooking
the
pool
nice
views."
As
they
walk
toward
the
elevator
the
organ
grinder
might
come
up
to
them
and
ask
"Aren't
you
.?"
"Yes
I'm
Mo
"Ferd?
Remember
me
from
Being
Alive
PWA
parties?"
"Oh
yes
remember
um
Bill
Aldous
Huxley!
And
of
course
you
recognize
my
boss
Mo
."
"Never
mind
just
meet
me
upstairs
Nice
.Bill?"
All
three
would
look
at
their
shoes
(one
pair
of
Pradas
two
pairs
of
canvas
sneakers)
as
Mobe
68
walks
away
"Well
that
wasn't
bit
awkward
So
Bill
how
funny
to
see
you
here
What
are
you
doing?"
Bill
might
be
feeling
little
nonplussed
himself
and
may
already
be
regretting
this
encounter
In
an
attempt
to
make
things
easier
he
might
answer
"I'm
rebuilding
an
organ
at
EuroDisney
and
I'm
running
pretty
late
Can
we
have
drink
later
and
catch
up?"
"Of
course
let's
call
each
other
I'm
up
in
what
they
call
the
Vice-Presidential
Suite
Mo'
is
great
guy
and
more
friend
than
boss
really."
"Cool
Call
you
tonight."
He'd
kiss
Ferd
and
walk
quickly
to
the
Disney
shuttle
outside
Mobe
68
meanwhile
would
have
gone
up
sharing
the
elevator
with
an
middle-aged
Black
man
who
looks
very
familiar
"Are
you
musician?"
"I
was
for
long
time
Chicago
Art
Ensemble
Joseph
is
my
name."
"Wow!
Joseph
Jamaal
saw
you
play
in
Chicago
few
years
ago
Your
chanting
and
clarinet
were
awesome!
With
Leroy
Jenkins
doing
incredible
things
on
the
violin
I'm
Mobe
68."
"Thanks
young
man
I've
heard
your
music
too
Here
to
do
recording
gig?"
"No
man
have
no
plans
at
all
just
travel
now."
At
the
third
floor
an
emaciated
woman
could
get
on
carrying
Maltese
with
rheumy
eyes
and
bad
underbite
as
Joseph
walks
off
saying
"Well
here's
my
floor
Nice
to
meet
you
Mobe
68
but
be
cool--the
past
is
emptiness;
'here
and
now.'19"
The
woman
Countess
Yousopoff-Blitzen
might
not
be
concerned
that
the
elevator
is
going
up
She
would
know
that
her
WTO
colleagues
wait
for
her
in
the
Snivilling
Lounge
She'd
look
up
expecting
mirrored
ceiling
smoothing
her
throat
and
lighting
cigarette
"Excuse
me
don't
think
you
can
smoke
in
here,"
Mobe
68
objects
"Silence,"
Karen
would
croak
and
jab
the
down
button
"This
must
be
your
floor
Please
get
out."
As
Mobe
68
turns
his
key
he
could
be
trying
to
concentrate
on
Christian
compassion
and
the
tasks
ahead
of
him

that

The

He

I:
Not

when
have
nothing
better

Oh
they're
not
here
to
be
watched
Not
at
these

Thirty-five
euros
quarter
whew!
I:
And
how
have
you
been
keeping
yourself?
heard
you
were
hooked
up
with
Dr
Dread
who
runs
the
Red
Hanky
Pavilion
No

there?
HE:
No
he's
turned

into

floor
and
it's
writhing
with
e-trash
heteroid

Now
it's
called

I:
Don't
you
welcome
the
acceptance
of

Imitation
is

HE:
If
that's

fuck

"If

yes

Though
some

the

suddenly
began
to
act
out
his

now
I'm
on

my

I:
It's
no
wonder
you
are
so
abandoned
Marcel
For
that
matter
doesn't
crystal
just
exaggerate
our
fundamental
alone-ness
in
the
world?
HE:
Mr
Philosopher
may
be
tweaking
but
know
my
ontology
"It's
understandable
but
wrong
the
notion
that
each
of
us
is
alone
imprisoned
within
the
individual
cranium
when
in
fact
even
the
physical
universe
of
matter
depends
on
us
to
exist
and
even
more
desperately
the
sperm
and
egg
that
make
us
and
the
genes
and
social
conditions
that
shape
each
of
us
The
other
is
always
before
us
demanding
that
we
be
selves
in
response
It's
fatuous
(no
self-centered
and
delusional)
to
think
we
think
alone
Our
mythologies
of
lost
or
fractured
selves
gluttonize--slobber--over
the
illusions
of
sameness
and
difference
self
and
other."21
I:
You
know
all
of
this
is
artifact
of

Althusser?

When
am

am

the

All

hung
up
on
the
fears
of
alienation
disintegration
that
our
dear
fathers
lived
to
feel
My

All
of
this
is
the
tragedy
of
the
last
Century
WWI
frightened
Europe
out
of
its
class
complacency
and
squelched
important
social
movements
The
Revolution
of
1917
created
hope
and
at
least
pole
of
support
for
liberation
of
the
colonies
The
Great
Depression
frightened
the
world
into
few
Keynesian
reforms
but
then
WWII
sent
all
our
men
to
war
let
them
kill
in
the
company
of
other
men
and
then
sent
them
home
to
individual
suburban
families
None
of
them
knew
how
to
be
with
women
or
children
so
then
came
the
baby
boom
Feeding
on
schedule
or
feeding
on

overfeeding
And
the

were
aflame

Suddenly
Marcel
shouts
Tim
come
over
here
man!
I:
Who
is
this
angelic
youth
with
white
hair
making
toward
us?
HE:
Timmy
Tilden
nephew
of
Bill
Tilden
tennis
star
of
the
20s
and
30s
who
was
imprisoned
twice
for
sex
with
teenage
boys
died
in
1953
Poor
man
his
only
girlfriend
said
he
"felt
things
so
deeply
never
saw
him
with
anybody
who
could
have
been
his
confidant
How
must
it
be
like
that22?"
I:
Can
we
change
our
lives?
HE:
hope
so
She
said
"There
must
have
been
so
many
things
deep
within
him
that
he
could
never
talk
about
suppose
he
died
of
broken
heart."
Anyway
Bill's
younger
brother
hooked
up
with
Tim's
mom--she
was
maid
for
Tracy
Lord
but
the
Tildens
ran
her
out
of
Philadelphia
with
film
crew

story
shortened:
.her
grandson
the
Tilden's
grand-nephew
was
rescued
from

in
Hollywood
and
brought
to
France
by
Mr

He's

into

an

he'll

you
I:
And
why
do
you
have
so
much
to
say
about
this
dangerous
young
man?
HE:
Because
he's
my
young
bud
aren't
you
Timmy?
take
care
of
my
red-eyed
little
polar
bear
TIMMY:
You

Can
you

HE:
I'll
get

Come

military

It's
all
set
up
they
just
called

Joseph
and
His
Brother
Joseph
Jamaal
is
not
completely
enthused
to
be
recognized
as
he
is
fugitive
from
US
justice
accused
(falsely)
of
complicity
in
Black
Liberation
Army
killings
of
police
in
the
1970s
He
is
waking
his
employer
Siegfried
Rheinfahrt
from
his
midmorning
nap
Laying
aside
volumes
of
Lenin
and
Heidegger
he
massages
the
old
man's
knees
until
he
opens
his
ice-blue
eyes
"Ja
aah
In
the
jugness
of
the
jug
sky
and
earth
dwell
..23
"You
are
awake
now
Herr
Siegfried,"
Joseph
says
calmly
"Ahh
Joseph,"
he
croaks
"I
think
understand
Kant
talks
about
things
in
the
same
way
as
Meister
Eckhart
and
means
by
this
term
'thing'
something
that
is
But
for
Kant
that
which
is
becomes
the
object
of
representing
that
runs
its
course
in
the
self-consciousness
of
the
human
ego
The
thing-in-itself
means
for
Kant:
the
object-in-itself
To
Kant
the
character
of
the
'in-itself'
signifies
that
the
object
is
an
object
in
itself
without
reference
to
the
human
act
of
representing
it
that
is
without
the
opposing
'ob-'
by
which
it
is
first
of
all
put
before
this
representing
act
:'Thing
-in-itself,'
thought
in
rigorously
Kantian
way
means
an
object
that
is
no
object
for
us
because
it
is
supposed
to
stand
stay
put
without
possible
before;
for
the
human
representational
act
that
encounters
it.'
It
is
very
materialist
despite
the
awful
neologisms."
Joseph
straightens
Siegfried's
sparse
white
hair
and
tells
him
"The
Buddha
teaches
that
sense
impressions
can
be
understood
as
relationships
of
conscious
being
to
being
The
"categories"
of
Kant
only
interfere
with
this
relationship
Heidegger
is
closer."
"Ja
yes
think
so."
He
reads
'This
appropriating
mirror-play
of
the
simple
onefold
of
earth
and
sky
divinities
and
mortals
we
call
the
world
The
world
presences
by
worlding
Joseph
reads
further
"'That
means:
the
world's
worlding
cannot
be
explained
by
anything
else
nor
can
it
be
fathomed
through
anything
else
This
impossibility
does
not
lie
in
the
inability
of
our
human
thinking
to
explain
and
fathom
this
way
Rather
the
inexplicable
and
unfathomable
character
of
the
world's
worlding
lies
in
this
that
causes
and
grounds
remain
unsuitable
for
the
world's
worlding
Herr
Siegfried
Heidegger
is
saying
what
the
Buddha
says--'As
soon
as
human
cognition
here
calls
for
an
explanation
it
fails
to
transcend
the
world's
nature
and
falls
short
of
it
The
human
will
to
explain
just
does
not
reach
to
the
simpleness
of
the
simple
onefold
of
worlding'
This
is
pretty
good
dharma
teaching."
"Joseph
my
Black
brother
what
can
an
old
Communist
like
me
do
with
this
dharma?
Am
just
disappointed
at
the
end
of
all
believed
in?
Is
there
no
revolution
to
be
made
now?"
"The
wheel
turns,"
Joseph
says
with
compassion
He
helps
his
patient
to
the
bathroom
where
Siegfried
hopes
to
squeeze
few
drops
through
his
urethra
While
Siegfried
sits
and
reminisces
about
Trevi
Joseph
replaces
his
books
and
prepares
him
lunchtime
fentanyl
injection
"Would
you
like
your
yogurt
enema
before
or
after?
can
read
to
you
from
the
April
Theses

if
you
like."

for

The
vitality
of
living
labor
Confronts
the
dead
power
of
capitalist
command
say
autonomist
theory
contrasts
the
vitality
of
living
labor
With
the
dead
power
of
capitalist
command
The
working
people
historically
assert
their
power
to
take
the
structures
in
their
hands
Intrinsic
to
the
capital-relation
Is
the
class
struggle
of
the
working
class
Prior
to
and
more
dynamic
than
capitalist
restructuring
Is
the
class
struggle
that
constitutes
the
working
class
Think
of
the
demand
for
an
eight-hour
day;
it
kicked
the
bosses
in
the
ass
Yes
people
productive
labor
Is
now
that
which
produces
society
itself
Let's
use
the
combination
of
our
productive
labor
To
sieze
freedom
however
momentarily
and
redistribute
wealth
Autonomists
say
we
can
communicate
our
social
inventiveness
and
make
the
world
something
else
The
active
subject
of
production
Is
the
increasingly
undifferentiated
working
class
The
wellspring
of
change
in
production
Is
the
self-autonomizing
working
class
Beyond
mere
resistance
are
moments
of
freedom;
they're
real
but
then
they
pass
Capital's
restructurings
"subsume"
not
only
the
workplace
But
society
as
whole
tell
you
in
its
processes
of
globalization
Reproduction
of
labor
power
occupies
crucial
but
unacknowledged
role
That's
why
welfare
moms
are
threatening
and
they
had
to
end
the
dole
Guerillas
moved
like
fish
in
the
water
Threatening
to
cut
off
resources
and
lands
Oh
yeah
in
Vietnam
Guatemala
and
elsewhere
liberation
fighters
Challenged
resource
allocation
in
the
jungles
and
the
sands
The
fall
of
communism
sadly
demobilized
support
for
progressive
guerilla
bands
Global
capital
then
broke
down
traditional
village
structures
Marched
women
and
children
off
the
farm
to
town
Tragically
capital
emiseration
in
favela
and
shanty
Is
what
happens
when
age-old
geography
breaks
down
But
international
mass
migrations
result
in
newer
combinations
where
resistance
can
abound
Husbands
dead
women
and
children
are
left
with
"free"
choices
To
choose
between
child
laborers
or
whores
prerequisite
for
capitalist
modernization
Is
landless
desperate
anomic
labor
force
War
disease
and
famine
threaten
to
cut
off
food
production
at
the
source
But
struggle
to
create
ourselves
as
subjects
Disrupts
and
tears
apart
systems
of
capitalist
rule
Despite
regimes
of
power
humans
make
themselves
subjects
Sabotaging
rectifying
evading
the
intentions
of
global
rule
Sometimes
distorted
and
mistaken
self-creation
is
quite
evident
among
youth
in
school
In
the
north
abandoned
plants
and
ruined
communities
Where
privilege
is
evanescing
no
longer
so
secure
In
the
south
devastation
and
dollar-a-month
factories
But
then
moments
of
freedom
where
people's
relationships
are
less
obscure
Creative
combinations
of
people
are
what
the
global
dominators
most
fear
The
points
where
operations
can
be
ruptured
Affirm
labor's
fundamental
otherness
from
capital
Let's
put
our
hands
to
the
points
to
be
ruptured
And
assert
that
we
are
sentient
like
any
other
plants
and
animal
We'll
show
the
Blairs
and
Cheneys
that
their
hierarchies
of
power
can
be
overturned
not
just
disrupted!
"Siegfried
did
you
know
it's
taken
me
years
to
be
able
to
sing
blues?"
Joseph
remembers
how
impatient
he
was
in
1965
how
unsophisticated
Otis
Spann
seemed
saying
on
the
radio
"If
you
don't
dig
the
blues
you've
got
hole
in
your
soul."
How
Joseph
and
his
peers
wanted
to
move
ahead
express
the
complexity
of
new
feelings
of
the
new
situation
they
faced
You
had
to
respect
those
bluesmen
but
we
knew
they
couldn't
understand
what
needed
to
be
done.26
"I
didn't
understand
really
was
so
moved
by
James
Baldwin--the
sins
of
our
fathers
We
wanted
the
Art
Ensemble's
music
to
go
further
than
Ornette
or
Coltrane
way
beyond
what
we
thought
good
ol'
blues
could
do
wish
knew
then
what
I've
had
to
learn
so
slowly."

Would
you
like
to
go
to
your
rooms
or
shall
take
you
directly
to

bunker
room?
Any
papers
you
wish
to
prepare?"
"It's
Colonel
South
(USMC
Ret.)
Please
get
me
bottle
of
Absolut
and
some
Vichy
water,"
South
curtly
replies
"You
may
take
me
to
the
Countess."
"I
will
personally
bring
your
drinks
and
Achmed
will
take
you
across
Achmed!"
Inspecting
the
Arab-looking
beauty
through
flat
green
lens
South
presently
says
"OK
You're
clean
Lead
on."
At
age
51
South
retains
the
body
tension
of
US
Marine
of
30
but
the
Christian
fascist
ideology
of
his
more
physical
early
career
has
been
tempered
by
philosophical
acquiescence
to

and
others'
weaknesses

Party
Out
of
Bounds
As
Tim
walks
in
between
sheets
of
black
plastic
Marcel
is
yelling
"Attention!"
at
the
two
jarheaded
men
from
the
HumVees
"Strip
you
maggots,"
Marcel
barks
Tim
is
not
sure
whether
he
should
take
his
own
clothes
off
In
doubt
he
sits
on
one
of
the
mattresses
strewn
about
the
slippery
floor
"Put
these
on
each
other
pigs,"
Marcel
continues
to
shout
throwing
black
latex
jockstraps
at
the
naked
men
"Come
here
Tim,"
he
growls
"Put
these
blindfolds
on
them
and
this
mask
on
your
own
face
And
get
into
those
leather
chaps."
As
Tim
covers
their
faces
Marcel
handcuffs
the
two
and
pulls
chains
down
from
the
rafters
"Hook
these
guys
up
Take
this
belt
and
batter
their
backsides
while
get
some
hits
ready
to
slam
them
up."
The
musty
room
above
the
garages
is
storehouse
for
all
the
junk
and
detritus
left
behind
over
the
75
years
the
hotel
has
accepted
guests
But
tonight
smeary
cubicle
has
been
put
up
with
staple
gun,;
the
party
space
confined
to
the
penumbra
of
tall
white
candle
the
flickering
light
and
mysterious
aroma
of
beeswax
disorienting
the
jarheads
Marcel
adjusts
two
monitors
to
play
continuous
hardcore
porn
to
soundtrack
of
Bartok
and
Lygeti
and
strews
condoms
paper
towels
and
Crisco
cans
all
around
the
mattresses
on
the
plastic-coated
floor
In
baritone
of
arrogated
authority
he
says
to
the
men
stretched
before
him
"We
will
cultivate
'the
self'
by
means
of
an
ascesis
an
'art
of
life.'"
He
shoots
into
their
veins
what
could
not
be
called
'good
drugs,'
but
ones
that
obliterate
the
subject
leaving
only
obsessive
repetitions
of
the
impulses
to
stimulate
nerve
endings
Coughing
and
then
moaning
the
twin
pigs
cry
out
"'Self'
is
not
personal
identity
so
much
as
it
is
relation
of
reflexivity
relation
of
the
human
subject
to
itself
in
its
power
and
its
freedom

Marcel
shoves
Tim
forward
He
urges
Tim
into
domination
postures
and
snaps
latex
gloves
on
his
white
hands

white
and
leather

the

sending
St
Teresa

Tim
shimmers
in
the
light
playing
on
his
lubricated
youthful
muscles
his
masculine
energy
rising
to
the
rhythms
of
Marcel's
rough
power
Together
they
drive
the
men
now
sobbing
and
vocalizing
their
fearful
rapture
to
greasy
black
leather
slings
At
Marcel's
instigation
Tim
utters
these
hypnotic
words:
"You
have
no
identity
here
You
are
only
vessels
for
pleasure
something
which
passes
from
one
person
to
another
It
is
not
secreted
by
identity."
Marcel
speaks
oracular
words
as
his
hands
move
in
profound
violation
of
nature's
fundament:
"I
don't
think
that
this
movement
of
sexual
practices
has
anything
to
do
with
the
disclosure
or
the
uncovering
of
S/M
tendencies
deep
within
our
unconscious
and
so
on
think
that
S/M
is
much
more
than
that;
it's
the
real
creation
of
new
possibilities
of
pleasure
which
people
had
no
idea
about
previously
The
idea
that
S/M
is
related
to
deep
violence
that
S/M
practice
is
way
of
liberating
this
violence
this
aggression
is
stupid
.I
think
it's
kind
of
creation
creative
enterprise
which
has
as
one
of
its
main
features
what
call
the
desexualization
[i.e
the
'degenitalization']
of
pleasure
The
idea
that
bodily
pleasure
should
always
come
from
sexual
pleasure
and
the
idea
that
sexual
pleasure
is
the
root
of
all
our
possible
pleasure--I
think
that's
something
quite
wrong."
Tim
hears
Marcel
saying
"This
is
our
century's
only
'brand
new'
contribution
to
the
sexual
armamentarium
The
19th
invented
myriad
species
of
perverse
sexual
desire
but
virtually
nothing
new
in
the
way
of
sexual
pleasure
had
been
created
for
millennia
We
delve
and
ravage
'the
self'
by
hand
because
'the
self
is
new
strategic
possibility
not
because
it
is
the
seat
of
our
personality
but
because
it
is
the
point
of
entry
of
the
personal
into
history.'
We
perform
'the
crucial
work
of
rupture
of
social
and
psychological
disintegration
that
may
be
necessary
to
permit
new
forms
of
life
to
come
into
being
but
there
is
no
guarantee
that
they
will
come
into
being

We
Might
Be
Together
few
of
us
were
together
We
had
almost-completely
lovely
times
with
our
young
bodies
together
ejaculating
enough
to
clear
the
major
toxins
(leaving
what
were
after
all
only
subsidiary
poisons
of
sexual
deviation
and
guilt
felt
by
some
who
were
out
of
phase
with
cosmic
duality
of
sex
vision)
although
we
went
out/in
on
long
and
fulfilling
trips
together
We
had
gone
to
places
so
sublime
that
difference
was
irrelevant--to
us
at
least
We
also
yearned
to
be
together
with
the
racial
Other
We
could
have
been
together
Then
we
would
have
thought
we
recognized
each
other
together
The
Intellectual
Origins
The
thought
was
that
repression
of
natural
impulses
was
reification
of
the
restriction
to
bare
necessities
for
labor
under
capitalist
relations
of
production
At
first
we
noticed
that
abundance
(not
necessarily
personal
abundance
although
the
post-WWII/Cold
War
takeoff
of
the
US
economy
afforded
better
living
for
much
higher
proportions
of
the
US
population)
was
not
satisfying
to
us
although
it
seemed
to
be
sufficient
for
our
parents
who
had
suffered
serious
deprivation
during
the
Depression
and
then
horrifying
war
(our
fathers
ignorant
men
thrown
together
in
foreign
lands
to
face
death
with
only
each
other's
bodies
for
support--while
longing
for
the
comfort
of
love
and
habit
sent
by
the
women
who
became
our
mothers
in
letters
to
unknowable
islands
and
bivouacs)
Our
dads
came
home
moved
into
nuclear
family
houses
farther
from
their
parents
aunts
uncles
etc
than
ever
before
tried
to
live
with
rectitude
and
diligence
amid
rising
prices
and
elevated
standards
of
liveable
housekeeping
tried
to
be
husbands
and
fathers
to
uncomprehending
wives
and
children
No
wonder
so
many
became
alcoholic
and
silent
no
wonder
so
many
women
secretly
suffocated
in
those
single-family
units
Children's
first
exposure
was
to
Dr
Spock's
kindly
strictures
to
feed
on
schedule
an
agonizing
commitment
for
parents
who
heard
their
babies'
cries
as
echoes
of
their
own
childish
deprivations
and
wanted
to
provide
better
for
their
offspring
The
moms
and
dads
capitulated
to
makeshift
of
indulgence
and
vaccination
hoping
for
clean
healthy
children
who
read
Dick
and
Jane
as
if
they
were
true
As
we
children
of
the
baby
boom
grew
older
we
had
more
free
time
than
any
previous
generation
on
earth
free
time
to
undergo
the
tidal
waves
of
adolescent
hormones
and
to
read
Catcher
in
the
Rye
and
even
On
the
Road
in
study
halls
although
we
also
memorized
Pledges
of
Allegiance
Declarations
of
Independence
and
believed
them
Then
televisions
began
to
show
us
vibrant
Black
children
singing
their
way
to
jail
for
"freedom,"
and
revealed
whole
other
America
that
wasn't
privileged
and
purposeless
We
were
electrified
by
the
righteousness
of
their
new
Black
way
and
the
brutality
of
the
old
segregationist
intransigience
We
were
educated
by
American
Bandstand
to
the
rigors
of
Cold
War
dating
and
those
of
us
who
couldn't
get
dates
understood
that
we
were
inadequate
Our
salvation
came
from
the
post-colonial
British
from
the
Beatles
who
were
able
to
repackage
Black
American
music
to
our
ill-formed
tastes
and
make
us
happy
with
dancing
that
did
not
require
touching
The
Beatles
neat
appearance
belied
their
snotty
grotty
sarcastic
resistance
to
the
parts
of
life
we
agreed
were
uncool
And
the
Rolling
Stones
were
better
than
greasers
almost
evil
but
British
so
they
couldn't
beat
us
up
So
many
of
us
escaped
to
college
We
suddenly
found
friends
who
did
not
think
we
were
inadequate
or
at
least
we
shared
inadequacy
and
fumbled
for
relief
from
restrictions
of
our
behavior
We
read
and
we
shared
Revolver
and
Bob
Dylan
and
we
began
to
grow
hair
to
smoke
pot
and
to
trip
Trips
were
dangerous
explorations
of
cosmic
reality
and
they
were
serious
only
occasionally
joyous
but
so
revelatory
as
to
be
precious
signposts
of
the
fulfillment
we
thought
we
lacked
In
the
swirling
hallucinations
we
also
felt
the
reality
of
our
own
bodies
sweating
breathing
ingesting
eliminating
fucking--thrilling
And
yet
the
world
was
going

Achmed's
Backstory
In
1948
as
war
clouds
darkened
the
deserts
Abra
Maslow
was
at
Petra
"Rose-Red
City
of
Biblical
Edom35,"
with
an
archeological
team
measuring
the
girth
and
length
of
the
columns
of
sandstone
carved
into
the
living
rock
by
the
Natabeans
Abra
was
the
daughter
of
the
brilliant
psychiatrist
Abraham
Maslow
who
worshiped
the
motherless
girl--some
said
he
set
her
on
pyramid
above
all
the
rest
of
womanhood
Her
education
was
strange
one
based
in
Maslow's
reading
of
the
life
of
John
Stuart
Mill
Abra
read
Heraclitus
in
Greek
and
Lucretius
in
Latin
by
age
five
and
besides
her
father's
German
and
English
she
also
was
versed
in
pre-Mohammedan
Arabic
Not
content
with
degrees
in
Pythagorean
geometry
and
Khwarizmi
algebra,36Abra
was
also
famous
hostess
and
cook
Her
salon
and
her
parties
at
the
Dakota
during
the
war
years
attracted
Ruth
Benedict
Margaret
Mead
and
Tallulah
Bankhead
uncorking
fine
vintages
and
feasting
on
Abra's
speciality
an
international
ratatouille
of
whole-roasted
zucchini
Japanese
eggplant
and
spicy
Italian
sausages
alla
putana37
later
copied
by
Alice
Waters
for
Chez
Panisse
One
fateful
day
in
the
blazing
sun
Abra
was
stretching
around
one
of
the
colossal
stones
with
tape
measure
seeking
the
Nabateans
idols
of
the
sun
god
Dushara
whose
symbol
was
an
uncut
black
stone
(Allat
the
great
mother
goddess
of
Arabia
was
his
mother
and
consort.)
All
over
Petra
she
had
opened
carved
niches
containing
pillars
or
large
separate
monoliths
representing
Dushara
She
was
in
front
of
the
Treasury
[Khazneh]
when
troop
of
Bedouins
came
thundering
up
picturesquely
on
their
sleek
Arabian
steeds
Their
muskets
firing
the
Bedouins
surrounded
Abra
and
sent
her
native
helpers
scurrying
into
the
dust
She
fearing
for
her
life
but
resolute
rose
and
turned
to
face
the
crowd
of
swarthy
men
The
tallest--sensually
dark
and
handsome--
dismounted
and
came
in
her
direction
seizing
her
by
the
hand
and
wrapping
his
other
arm
around
her
waist
scream
was
forced
from
her
lips
as
they
were
pressed
against
the
firm
mouth
and
bulging
chest
of
this
man
with
magnetic
dark
eyes
In
an
instant
Abra
was
swept
away
captive
of
the
Sheikh
Making
from
Petra
for
the
Wadi
Arabah
the
Sheikh's
band
had
stiff
climb
down
unloading
and
loading
the
horses
and
pack
mules
where
the
trail
between
rock
cliffs
was
too
narrow
to
let
them
pass
There
at
Wadi
Musa
where
the
rock
finally
opened
these
wild
knights
of
the
desert
paused
and
pitched
their
tents
while
the
erotic
dancing
girls
undulated
rhythmically
As
they
cooled
their
palates
and
ate
their
dates
the
Sheikh's
men
knew
they
could
not
be
followed
as
they
were
the
masters
of
their
desert
domain
An
international
incident
ensued;
the
British
Protectorate
was
forced
to
divert
key
unit
of
men
from
Jerusalem
to
search
for
Abra
thereby
leaving
the
King
David
Hotel
unprotected
But
that
first
night
Abra
faced
her
captor
alone
on
the
moonlit
desert
She
was
carried
into
his
tent
and
bathed
by
three
maidens
who
scented
her
hair
with
jasmine
then
draped
her
in
rich
silks
She
was
thrown
onto
divan
covered
in
priceless
rugs
right
into
the
arms
of
the
young
Sheikh
now
abluted
and
smelling
of
powerful
sweet
musk--although
there
was
also
an
intoxicating
aroma
of
horse
and
sweat
lingering
at
his
thighs
Still
determined
not
to
collapse
in
fear
Abra
sat
up
and
said
in
archaic
Arabic
"Honorable
host
please
treat
this
guest
with
the
courtesies
traditionally
vouchsafed
to
strangers."
His
eyes
widening
smile
brightening
his
sensual
lips
the
Sheik
answered
her
in
Oxbridge
English
"You
will
be
treated
better
than
if
you
were
mere
stranger
Remember
how
receptive
to
strangers
they
were
at
Sodom
which
lies
buried
only
few
leagues
from
here
Now
will
have
kiss!"
Abra
feeling
it
was
more
strategic
not
to
resist
too
much
tried
to
turn
away
but
his
exotic
honeyed
tongue
darted
between
her
lips
before
she
was
prepared
"Ohhh
please,"
she
moaned
"Be
gentle."
The
Sheikh
emitted
low
musical
laugh
and
replied
"I
am
always
gentle
and
always
savage
In
this
case
however
since
you
are
an
agent
of
international
petroleum
prospectors
you
do
not
deserve
much
gentleness
in
this
our
desert
land."
He
pulled
her
roughly
toward
him
and
grasping
her
wrists
extended
her
body
across
the
soft
rugs
and
lay
atop
her
"I
am
scientist
and
virtuous
woman,"
Abra
cried
in
Natabean
but
her
cries
went
unheeded
as
the
moon
and
its
caravan
of
stars
crossed
the
blue
desert
"
."
Less
than
year
later
the
Sheikh
proudly
held
up
Achmed
ben
Maslow-Sheikh
his
beautiful
son
and
named
him
his
heir
commanding
all
the
tribes
of
Bedouins
to
swear
fealty
and
loyalty
to
him
forever
As
they
swore
their
oaths
the
baby's
mother
shot
her
violator
the
father
of
her
child
through
the
heart
and
was
consequently
set
upon
and
butchered
by
the
loyal
Bedouins
Achmed
however
grew
to
manhood
(shortening
his
name
to
ben
Maas)
went
to
Oxford
like
his
father
and
--hurrying
along
this
story--
became
the
chief
accountant
for
Phillips
Petroleum
He
married
the
delicate
daughter
of
Greek
tycoon
and
they
had
four
sons
and--the
deglet
noor
of
his
eye--a
daughter
Oedipa
Raised
in
historic
Baghdad
the
urban
center
of
the
most
sophisticated
Islamic
country
in
the
world
Oedipa
outdistanced
her
girlfriends
and
especially
her
brothers
in
all
games
and
in
learning
Particularly
fond
of
riding
and
polo
Oedipa
was
furious
when
at
thirteen
she
was
no
longer
permitted
on
the
team
She
grew
rebellious
flirted
with
the
Baathists
but
left
them
quickly
and
was
soon
the
leader
of
the
transnational
smarty
set
of
oil-rich
sons
and
daughters
who
outraged
their
parents
with
their
sexual
license
and
intellectual
probing
Oedipa
smouldered
knowing
she
must
achieve
self-actualization
At
fifteen
after
an
incident
at
the
Iraq
Desert
Country
Day
School
where
she
was
nearly
violated
by
US
Army
Baptist
chaplain
Oedipa
ran
away
to
Jerusalem
and
became
dedicated
revolutionary
had
brief
and
fiery
affairs
with
Edward
Said
and
Leila
Khaled
escaped
to
California
and
joined
the
Wymmyn's
Fyre
Brygade
an
anti-imperialist
collective
in
Encino
It
was
from
there
she
helped
Tania
to
run
from
the
bullets
and
where
she
began
her
Transition
taking
testosterone
and
pumping
iron
surgically
molding
breasts
into
hard
pecs
By
age
thirty
he
was
Achmed
an
anti-imperialist
like
his
grandfather
Marxist
Muslim
fighting
global
capitalism
and
sexual
oppression
around
the
world
Hated
by
fundamentalists
feared
by
global
capitalists
Achmed
worked
in
clandestinity
supporting
himself
as
sex
worker
male
or
female
as
the
revolutionary
situation
demanded
Petra
and
Petroleum
Petra
sat
at
the
crossroad
of
two
major
ancient
routes
the
King's
Highway
and
the
Incense
Route
It
was
these
routes
which
were
fought
over
so
violently
between
Solomon
and
the
Edomites
The
wealth
gained
in
their
control
was
fantastic
as
witness
the
stories
told
of
Solomon's
Temple
etc
Its
first
written
history
is
found
in
the
Hebrew
Bible;
for
the
land
about
it
was
Mount
Seir
of
old
(now
Esh
Sera)
home
of
the
Horites
cave
dwellers
whose
progenitor
was
Hori
the
grandson
of
Seir
(Gen.36:20)
These
Horites
are
first
mentioned
at
the
time
of
Abraham
in
connection
with
the
subjugation
of
the
land
by
Chedorlaomer
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
made
war
against
the
children
of
Seir
and
took
Selah
(Petra?
see
argument
above)
smiting
ten
thousand
"And
other
ten
thousand
left
alive
did
the
children
of
Judah
carry
away
captive
and
brought
them
unto
the
top
of
the
rock
and
cast
them
down
from
the
top
of
the
rock
that
they
all
were
broken
in
pieces"
(2Chron
25:
12)
Could
this
"top
of
the
rock"
have
been
Umm
el
Biyara?
The
debate
continue
to
rage
We
know
that
Crusader
King
Baldwin
constructed
at
Petra
castle
called
Selah
the
Bible
name
for
Petra
(2Ki.14:7)
He
was
following
the
old
idea
of
controlling
and
taking
toll
from
the
caravan
routes
money
being
his
prime
objective
in
the
Crusade
Though
Crusaders
constructed
fort
there
in
the
12th
century
they
soon
withdrew
leaving
Petra
to
the
local
people
The
city
died
out
of
men's
memory
and
the
nomads
used
it
as
hideout
living
in
the
nearby
caves
for
thousand
years

Vyvyan
as
the

head
toward
the

"Have

the
Manager
oilily
shoving
Timmy
after
them
Cyril
oboes
"Down

the
far
end

from

Casino
It's

Baring
their
leathery
skin
to
the
sun
Cyril
and
Vyvyan
settle
on
chaises
longues
inviting
Tim
Tilden
to
join
them
He
sits
between
them
on
towel
and
pulls
off
his
shirt
revealing
Hellenic
marble
chest
upholstered
in
white
wool
"How
are
you
gentlemen
enjoying
the
summer?
What
brings
you
to
this
godforsaken
shack?"
He
picks
thoughtlessly
at
scab
on
his
nipple
Vyvyan
replies
"Oh
it's
too
cold
down
in
Namibia
where
we
live
And
we're
always
traveling
anyway--it's
our
work
And
you?
Aren't
you
American?
"African
American,"
says
Tim
"I've
lived
here
since
was
twelve
years
old
See
Mrs
Sithole
brought
me
here
from
Hollywood
'cause
was
an
orphan
My
mom
was
in
the
movies
and
my
great-great
uncle
was
almost
President;
he
won
the
popular
vote
in
the
highly-disputed
Tilden-Hayes
election
of
1877
He
was
defeated
in
the
House
by
radical
reconstructionists
which
was
good
thing
I'm
going
to
study
film
this
year."
"Oh
everyone
will
be
so
proud
of
you
young
man,'
Vyvyan
tells
him
Just
then
stricken
policewoman
rushes
by
carrying
scorched
baby
with
bottle
clenched
in
its
mouth
"Oh
the
poor
child!"
gushes
Cyril
"I
must
see
what
can
do."
Pulling
on
his
shirt
he
dashes
toward
the
front
of
the
hotel
"Cyril
has
such
generous
heart,"
Vyvyan
sighs
lovingly
"God
knows
he's
kept
me
all
these
years
And
was
an
orphan
too
from
the
Blitz!"
"You
were?
guess
he
can
afford
it."
Vyvyan
gaily
retorts
"Oh
we
live
on
nothing--eat
like
two
old
birds
Cyril
got
fantastically
rich
selling
gentlemen's
jimmys--AIDS
you
know
But
all
the
money--750
million
pounds--went
into
the
Burst-Throbbing
Foundation
for
Wayward
Boys
and
Girls
The
BTF
rescues
sex-variant
children
all
over
the
world
Well
mostly
Africa
and
the
Middle
East."
"Another
Disney
operation?"
Tim
sneeringly
asks
"Oh
no
dear
we're
not
Disney
at
all
We're
the
anti-Disney
Phalanx
Sunblock?"
"Uh
thanks
need
it."
As
Vyvyan
lubricates
Tim's
alabaster
muscles
he
exclaims
"What
entrancing
eyes!
You
have
eyes
like
Siberian
Husky;
underneath
the
red
they
are
ice
blue."
"Yeah
guess
it's
the
albinism."
Cyril
bustles
back
to
say
"My
stars
Vyv
That
baby
was
nearly
electrocuted
in
the
Casino
They're
searching
for
its
mother
now."
"Oh
Cyril
you're
very
flushed
Sit
under
the
shade
Here
take
valium
and
calm
down."
"Um
can
have
one
too?"
asks
Tim
as
winningly
as
he
can
"Maybe
you
two
would
like
to
relax
upstairs
with
massage?
I'd
better
get
out
of
the
sun."
"Speak
up
dear
boy--Cyril
and
are
both
deaf
as
posts
Ohh
no
thank
you
We're
meeting
nice
musical
artist
here
for
lunch."

"Hello
Uncle
Vyvyan,"
said
Mobe

"You
look
beautiful
in
the
sun."
"Oh
you
dear
boy!
Sit
here
beside
me
Ferdie
you
sit
there
next
to
Cyril
so
he
can
feel
you
up
No
sense
fiddling
with

who
still
thinks
he's
'jam38'."
Hi
Cyril
How
are
you
love?"
asked
Mobe
kissing
his
uncles
on
both
cheeks
"I'm
so
happy
to
be
here
and
not
in
Ubud
We
got
out
just
before
the
summer
Hindu
surfers
arrived."
"What
are
you
reading
Ferdie
dear?"
Cyril
asked
him
"Would
you
boys
like
drink?
Vyvyan
call
Achmed
over
Mobius
we
have
wonderful
news!
We
just
ran
into
your
Aunt
Karen!"
"Ugh!
Please
don't
tell
her
I'm
here
yet
Cyril
can't
take
another
session
with
the
photo
albums
Ferd
you
better
go
to
the
desk
and
leave
her
message."
"That's
right
love
And
we
need
few
minutes
tete
tete
with
Mobe
Be
dear
and
tell
Achmed
we'll
have
Svack
before
lunch--the
round
bottle
tell
him
And
watercress
sandwiches
for
four?"
As
Ferd
walked
away
Cyril
bent
nearer
his
nephew
to
say
"We
have
two
exciting
assignments
for
you!
We've
been
so
busy!
Caprice

for

struggling
to
maintain

in

that
is
too
cold
and
wet

too
hot
and
dry
It
is
patient
in
the

It
tells
Merle
"The
existence
of
reciprocal
relationships
of
things
implies
that
each

existing
in

makes
some
contribution
to
what
the

as

is

that
cannot

to
the

I--as

also

evidently
that
no

can
have
complete
autonomy
in
its

since
its

characteristics
must
depend
on
its
relationships

therefore

putting

That

How
did
love
to
hear
the
winds

Thy

without

all

It
seasoned

Though

thee

thee
her

came

shook
thee

Summers

thy

sought
thee
in

shade

made

of

The

sang
and
felt

alone
While
in

not

Thou
owned

Deeper

And

now
what's

"In

he

"with

The
Buddha
is
the
chief
of
living
beings
who
include
the
yakkhas
and
other
related
non-human
beings
that
figure
in
tovil
Although
they
have
the
power
to
make
their
victims
ill
in
various
ways
--
such
as
by
possession

etc
--
they

are
made
to
them
Even
the
mere
mention
of
the
Buddha's
virtues
is
enough
to
frighten
them
Moreover
the
chief
of
the
yakkhas
Vessavana
(Vesamuni)
is
one
of
the
four
regents
of
the
universe
(maharaja)
and
as
such
devoted
follower
of
the
Buddha
The
ordinary
yakkhas
that
trouble
human
beings
have
to
obey
his
commands
Thus
in
all
rituals
connected
with
tovil
it
is
in
the
name
of
the
Buddha
and
Vessavana
that
the
yakkhas
are
commanded
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
exorcist
And
in
the
rich
folklore
that
deals
with
tovil
there
are
many
anecdotes
that
connect
every
ritual
or
character
with
some
Buddha
of
the
past

with

Buddhist
deity."
Into

The

Ritual
Merle
yips
the
growing
crowd
into
silence
He
knows
that
first
one
must
recite
the
Metta
Dhajagga
and
Ratana
Suttas
He
does
so
"We
will
dispense
with
the
armed
guard
and
getting
the
patient
to
offer
me
seat
and
go
directly
to
the
paritta
the
offering
of
flowers
and
lamps
to
the
dagaba
and
the
recitation
by
the
bhikkhu
(me)
of
set
of
benedictory
stanzas
called
(Maha)-mangala-gatha.[24]
He
summons
full
assembly
of
the
deities
Then
he
barks
out
orders
to
the
evil
spirit
to
say
his
name
"I
am
the

details,"
is
heard
coming
from
the
blue
lips
of
the
baby
The
compassionate
Dog
tenderly
licks
the
burned
face
of
the
baby
and
tells
the
devil
firmly
but
respectfully
"the
merits
of
offering
incense
flowers
alms
etc
are
all
transferred
to
you;
the
mangala-gatha
just
referred
to
have
been
recited
in
order
to
appease
you
(pannaharatthaya:
as
gift)
and
you
should
therefore
leave
the
patient
in
deference
to
the
Sangha
(bhikkhusangha-garavena)."
This
is
the
dangerous
point
as
Merle
knows
well
If
the
spirit
still
refuses
to
leave
the
deities
must
be
informed
of
his
obstinacy
and
the
Atanatiya
Paritta
will
be
recited
after
declaring
that
as
the
spirit
does
not
obey
them
they
are
carrying

If
can
now
remember
them

some
down
Our
brains
seem
to
work
through
chemical
and
electrical
circuits
that
first
register
bodily
impressions--whether
presented
from
outside
through
the
senses
or
internally
from
nerves
monitoring
the
body
or
nerves
monitoring
the
thought
processes
and
memory
The
mind
develops
as
consciousness
that
our
brain/body
is
actively
involved
in
the
process
of
processing
The
mind
is
somehow
tricked
into
believing
that
it
is
continuous
and
identical
to
itself
despite
the
ocurrence
of
different
sense
impressions
and
different
sentient
responses
at
each
moment
of
our
lives
We
seem
to
want
to
believe
we
are
the
same
from
day
to
day;
hence
the
creation
of
"self"
as
vessel
of
continuity
of
identity
Of
course
this
"self"
is
inflected
by
genetic
and
cultural
factors:
21st
US
gay
white
male
self
is
not
just
biological
but
historical
This
"self"
comes
to
dominate
our
reception
of
input
and
processing
of
reactions--feelings
and
thoughts
There
is
some
speculation
that
because
women
are
subjected
to
much
more
biological
change
on
periodic
basis
they
have
less
investment
in
the
rigid
maintenance
of
continuous
self-identical
"self."
In
any
case
most
of
Western
history
explains
things
on
the
basis
of
continuities
individual
or
social
and
the
interruptions
to
continuity
Our
"self"
tries
to
hold
things
together
in
the
midst
of
ongoing
chaos
by
assuming
continuities
and
asserting
it
can
and
must
integrate
different
responses
to
similar
and
even
wildly
divergent
processes
that
happen
to
the
body
and
the
mind
One
of
the
ways
it
asserts
this
attempted
integration
is
to
believe
the
individual
thoughts
that
pass
through
our
minds
(scientists
concerned
with
thoughts
and
consciousness
say
thought
passes
through
in
around
20
seconds
and
that
new
one
occurs
at
least
as
often)
are
connected
to
each
other
although
they
are
not--in
fact--connected
by
anything
except
the
assertion
of
their
connectedness
take
from
this
the
conclusion
that
desire
to
integrate
different
impressions
feelings
or
impulses
into
self
is
based
on
an
illusory
belief
that
it
is
even
possible
and
therefore
that
the
attempt
to
integrate
is
always
failure
That
failure
results
in
feeling
of
inadequacy
that
is
the
genetic
consequence
of
the
fact
that
our
brains
are
too
sophisticated
for
our
own
good
An
individual
human
feels
inadequacy
(basic
shame)
not
because
he/she
isn't
as
good
as
others
but
because
no
human
is
capable
of
integrating
what
is
not
integrate-able
Nor
is
any
human
capable
of
reconciling
autonomy
vs
doubt
of
her
capabilities
love
vs
hate
like
vs
dislike
or
any
other
thing
we
see
as
dichotomous
bifurcated
opposite--because
binaries
are
also
inadequate
to
contain
the
complex
variability
of
situations
and
lead
to
rigid
distinctions
about
what
is
inside
and
what
is
outside
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
what
is
functional
and
what
is
dysfunctional
Human
society
functions
through
the
confusion
of
our
connections
and
disconnections
with
others
and
ourselves
pretending
we
are
individual
identities
and
creating
power
networks
that
pervade
every
distinction
Sexuality
is
one
of
the
confusing
connections/disconnections
that
is
infused
with
power
and
powerlessness
and
is--like
all
other
processes--actually
not
composed
of
self
and
other
in
and
out
good
and
bad
creative
and
destructive
because
these
binaries
are
inadequate
but
just
about
as
far
as
our
brains
can
go
with
the
delusions
of
continuity
and
self-identity
20th-21st
gay
men
in
the
US
inherit
American
culture
and
struggle
with
it
burdened
like
all
other
humans
with
the
delusion
that
it
is
possible
to
integrate
impossibly
divergent
feelings
impressions
impulses
into
coherent
"self."
Since
we
can't
we
feel
shame
Others
feel
shame
too
but
our
shame
is
inscribed
with
the
dichotomies
and
hierarchies
of
masculine
power
in
our
own
particular
gay
male
way
as
constructed
by
the
social
processes
(gender
class
race
geographic
accident)
of
the
last
several
centuries
So
why
not
decide
that
shame
is
inevitable
that
everyone
feels
it
in
her/his
own
body
and
that
therefore
it
is
not
useful
to
do
anything
with
it
except
ilaugh
at
it
and
move
on
We
ignore
the
fact
that
we
can't
fly:
we
don't
feel
shame
at
not
being
able
to
overcome
gravity
We
do
invent
airplanes
and
banana
peel
jokes
We
also
invent
philosophies
psychologies
and
religions
that
help
transcend
the
blame
and
depression
that
are
reactions
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
human
brain
We
even
invent
anti-depressants
most
of
which
are
pretty
crude
at
this
stage
Wild
sex
is
one
of
the
incommensurable
feelings
bodily
and
social
processes
that
sometimes
breaks
through
the
rigidities
of
"self"
and
allows
us
the
relief
of
dis-integration
of
non-identity
It
can't
last
because
our
mind/body
cannot
continue
without
the
assertion
of
identity
Ecstasy
means
(from
Greek)
outside
the
self
But
nothing
we
have
invented
can
overcome
the
basic
problem
that
we
can't
integrate
un-integrate-able
differences;
we
want
wild
sex
and
we
want
domestic
comfort
They
can
be
made
to
coexist
but
they
can't
be
made
into
one
stable
thing
The
recent
history
of
gay
sex
through
sexual
experimentation
to
the
search
for
transcendence
and
blowing
our
minds
to
AIDS
to
post-AIDS
ennui
and
depression
is
think
evidence
of
our
biological
and
social
limitations
Two
20th
gay
white
American
men
were
talking
together
One
asked
the
other
"Do
you
smoke
after
intercourse?"
The
other
replied
"I
don't
know
I've
never
looked."
The
Other
is
of
course
non-identical
different
from
me
and
different
from
itself
We
all
think
poop
smells
but
each
of
us
thinks
our
own
poop
actually
smells
pretty
ok
We
like
its
familiarity
and
hope
it
is
the
same
every
time
We
like
sameness--men
particularly
like
sameness
and
they
seek
to
be
the
same
all
the
time
They
also
like
other
men
because
they
are
the
same
familiar
to
the
senses
It
is
possible
for
man
to
imagine
how
another
man
feels
pooping
sweating
running
eating
laughing
being
hurt
being
afraid
Since
he
seeks
to
integrate
his
contradictory

he
looks
to

for
help
and
for
models
of
how
to
do

Hang
around
any
schoolyard
in
Germany
or
college
campus
in
Indonesia
and
it
becomes
clear
that
the
recording
industry's
problems
with
the
illegal
online
distribution
of
music
in
the
United
States
pale
beside
the
rampant
piracy
that
goes
on
overseas
The
industry's
biggest
hurdle
may
be
cultural
As
is
the
case
among
many
young
people
in
the
United
States
swapping
files
and
burning
tracks
on
CD's
are
viewed
in
most
countries
as
routine
not
renegade
behavior
After
all
the
most
popular
file-sharing
software
KaZaA
was
dreamed
up
by
Swede
and
written
by
three
young
Estonians
"I
adored
Leslie
Cheung
but

he
made

honestly
speaking,"
said
our
contestant
referring
to
the
late
gay
Taiwanese
pop
star
whose
songs
are
actively
swapped
over
the
Internet
Piracy
of
course
affects
more
than
pop
star's
paycheck
Sales
of
recorded
music
have
plunged
more
steeply
in
several
European
and
Asian
countries
than
in
the
United
States
because
of
combination
of
file
sharing
home
CD
burning
and
the
mass
production
of
knock-off
disks
In
Germany
Europe's
largest
and
hardest-hit
market
sales
have
fallen
by
third
in
the
last
five
years
They
are
projected
to
decline
another
20
percent
this
year
compared
with
12
percent
first-half
decline
in
the
United
States
These
examples
leave
out
China
where
piracy
exists
on
an
entirely
different
scale
Nine
out
of
10
recordings
in
China
are
pirated
according
to
the
International
Federation
of
the
Phonographic
Industry
an
umbrella
group
for
46
national
industry
organizations
File
sharing
appears
to
be
as
cross-
cultural
as
any
other
type
of
piracy
The
amount
of
swapping
in
country
generally
correlates
to
the
number
of
people
who
have
PC's
with
high-speed
Internet

The
United
Nations
said
today
that
American-financed
aerial
eradication
of
Colombia's
vast
coca
fields
is
starting
to
pay
big
dividends
and
released
estimates
that
show
the
size
of
the
crop
dropping
by
32
percent
in
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
Production
of
coca
the
main
ingredient
in
cocaine
is
increasing
slightly
in
Peru
and
Bolivia
But
the
sizable
reduction
in
Colombia's
crop
means
that
for
the
first
time
overall
coca
production
in
the
Andes
is
dropping
at
rapid
pace
The
new
estimates
from
the
United
Nations
Drug
Control
Program
show
that
coca
fields
in
Colombia
fell
to
170,430
acres
on
July
31
from
251,940
acres
last
December
At
this
rate
the
United
Nations
said
Colombia's
coca
crop
will
be
reduced
50
percent
by
the
end
of
the
year
The
American
Congress
is
debating
whether
to
provide
another
$700
million
in
aid
to
Colombia
on
top
of
$2.5
billion
that

The
new
data
though
are
sure
to
encourage
supporters
of
eradication
"Many
people
who

couldn't
be

in

past
are

to

their

Mr

the

We
the
All
speak
and
make
tools
beautifully
All
do
not
merely
"produce,"
as
in
productive
labor;
All
are
fully
modern
but
have
not
had
to
distinguish
the
infrastructural
"labor"
of
acquiring
and
cooking
food
from
the
superstructural
"leisure"
of
talking
after
eating
or
"ritual"
of
singing
It
would
be
mistaken
to
see
the
life
of
All
through
the
(Marxist)
Western
lens
of
"the
production
of
the
material
necessity
of
life,"
since
All
linvest
our
prodigious
cognitive
and
emotive
skills
in
everything
we
do
and
have
developed
complex
society
in
which
connections
to
each
other
and
to
the
rest
of
the
world
are
felt
very
strongly-more
strongly-felt
through

than
through
individual
sensoria
Living
is
not
easy
for
All:
glaciers
and
the
dangers

narrow
our
world;
but
All's
painters
singers
and
dancers
express
and
symbolize
our
cognitions
in
complex
somatic
verbal
and
plastic
form
It
is
important
to
note
that
All
artists
are
not
"representing"
reality;
as
Gog
says
"All
dance
in
trance
Send
Gog
to
look
and
mark
Gog
paint
allow
animal
to
emerge
from
rock
live
with

Gog
enjoy
primary
(limbic)
consciousness
like
eat
sleep

Gog
experience
secondary
(cerebral)
consciousness
as
difficult
like

don't
like
make
anxious
or
regretful
In
her
award
presentation
Miss
Welch
states
"For
All
the
cerebral
cortex
is
(relatively)
newly-evolved
toolset
without
an
owner's
manual
and
its
habit
of
focusing
attention
on
the
processes
of
feeling
and
cognition
has
brought
in
train
the
dis-ease
of
narrating
stitching
transitory
sense
impressions
and
feelings
into
coherent
but
sometimes
worrisome
speculations
on
causation
Gog
like
the
others
has
legitimate
fear
of
cave
bears
and
cave
tigers
But
All
tend
to
over-interpret
dark
as
fearful
mentally
narrating
the
fear
threaded
with
memories
of
past
attacks
and
predictions
of
possible
future
pain
that
may
obscure
the
core
brain
state
of
efficiently
living
in
the
present
This
tendency
in
the
darkness
of
life
is
brightened
by
voluntary
surrender
to
the
shared
ecstasy
of
safety
and
worship
of
fecundity
envisioned
in
the
shape
of
woman-as-Goddess
Since
evidence
of
the
need
for
and
chromosomes
is
invisible
to
them
All
experience
sexual
contact
without
deducing
its
role
in
reproduction
or
imposing
the
standard
of
reproduction
on
the
sexual
activity
All
like
the
bonobos
have
sex
with
same
and
other-gender
partners
All
see
that
children
are
born
from
the
bodies
of
women
Their
groups
might
be
as
matrifocal
as
bonobos'
as
well."

Dear

Your
description
of
Gog
and
Magog
was
noted
here
Some
of
the
views
(fictionalized
assume
by
the
author)
were
inaccurate
Please
see
the
following
actual
quotations
from
individuals
in
the
Chauvet
Cave:
"My
body
moves
to
the
singing
and
drumming
the
bone
flutes
the
holy
waters
shared
the
bodies
all
around
me
in
the
resonating
chamber
of
the
cave."

"I
come
to

state
where
embrace
all
of
us
as
one
where
our
people
feel
special
and
right

and
each
one
of
us
is
full
of
light
and
power."

The
above
are
thoughts
notated
by
myself
Trzz
an
ethnobiologist
from
the
region
of
Altair
(Krell
people)
have
spent
10,000
revolutions
of
Earth
around
its
star
watching
these
homo
sapiens
sapiens
I
Trzz
herself
am
immaterial
which
enables
me/her
to
eavesdrop
on
spoken
and
unspoken
language
taking
on
such
forms
as
lichens
on
cave
walls
cave
bear
assailants
on
the
attack
earwax
of
old
people
exchanging
formulas
to
ward
off
decrepitude-whatever
form
necessary
to
record
the
descriptions
the
humans
generate
as
they
experience
their
ritual
life
I
Trzz
believe
that
the
humans
she/I
observe
seek
two
categories
of
holiness
One
is
the
state
or
process
of
transcendence
knowing
the
ultimate
stepping
out
of
self
through
pain
ecstasy
whatever
into
feeling
of
unity
wholeness
of
uniting
with
higher
levels
of
being
These
modes
of
transcendence
are
more
or
less
known
and
knowable
and
can
be
correlated
with
the
levels
of
brain/mind
consciousness
The
other
category
is
the
recognition
and
embrace
of
Immanence
beyond
epistemology
not
category
of
knowing
but
one
derived
from
the
logic
of
inner
and
outer
self
and
other
I
Trzz
note
"I
reject
the
possible
correlation
of
these
two
categories
with
the
sexual
division
of
labor
among
humans
and
ultimately
with
gender
stereotyping
By
the
time
of
the
High
Paleolithic
or
Neolithic
cultures
of
these
caves
societies
had
evolved
far
beyond
the
basic
divisions
of
child
rearing
and
other
tasks
have
witnessed
the
fact
that
women
provide
adequately
for
themselves
and
their
children
and
share
the
surplus
through
food
gathering
and
hunting
of
small
nearby
animals
Given
the
consequent
fact
(as
have
observed
here
in
30,000
BC)
that
social
structures
rather
than
necessity
selected
for
hunting
conclude
that
men
developed
hunting
as
supplement
as
something
helpful
but
not
usually
necessary
something
to
do
to
exercise
their
brains
and
to
take
more
active
role
Cooperation
and
language
had
already
been
established
through
experience
of
gathering
sharing
and
maintaining
food
and
the
health
of
mother-child
groupings
All
of
these
activities
could
be
performed
with
the
brain
of
Neanderthal
as
Trzz
has
observed
among
the
Neanderthal
groups
who
lived
nearby
the
sites
of
the
more
sapient
cave
users

Dear
Trzz
have
seen
your
comments
on
this
matter
Consider
the
following
propositions:
1.The
opening
to
immanent
holiness
in
existence
could
be
related
to
the
evolution
of
the
cerebral
cortex
and
therefore
to
an
unknowable
knowing
performed
by
the
complex
bundling
of
neural
pathways
but
unavailable
to
consciousness

The
wonder
felt
at
the
"thusness"
of
everything
might
have
its
holy
origin
in
the
processes
the
brain
uses
to
monitor
its
own
active
consciousness
without
transmitting
them
to
the
conscious
mind

"Life
is
business
whose

far
from
covering
the

Let
us
merely
look

it;
this

continue
for

merely
by
devouring
one

pass
their
existence
in
anxiety

often
endure
terrible
affliction
until
they
fall
at
last
into
the
arms
of
death."
"If
the

were
paradise
of
luxury
and
ease
men
would
either
die
of
boredom
or
kill
themselves
If
children
were

alone
would
the

Would

of
those
crazy
'Free
Spirits.'
Back
in
1400
barely
escaped
from
the
Black
Death
in
severely
depopulated
Europe
they
called
themselves
'poor
good
youths'
and
'good
daughters.'
They
rejected
the
sacramental
system
without
worrying
about
excommunication
They
said
'I
am
poor
boy
or
girl'
instead
of
'I
am
poor
man
or
woman'
to
emphasize
their
humility
(?)
and
spoke
impersonally:
'it
is
said
to
you'
instead
of
'I
say
to
you.'
They
all
were
'followers
(and
imitators)
of
Christ
and
the
Apostles,'
which
was
way
of
indicating
they
disdained
Church
hierarchies
and
followed
their
own
collective
mystical
inspiration."

Manatees
have
one
type
of
teeth
molars
They
are
the
type
used
for
grinding
and
work
well
for
the
foods
the
manatees
eat
The
teeth
in
front
wear
down
as
the
manatee
gets
older
But
new
teeth
form
in
the
back
of
the
jaw
moving
forward
to
replace
them
That
tooth
movement
is
called
the
"marching
molars"
Manatees
are
plant
eaters
They
feed
on
all
sorts
of
sea
plants
An
average
manatee
may
eat
100-150
pounds
of
food
each
day
They
swallow
sea
squids
or
mollusks
that
may
be
attached
to
the
seagrasses
they
eat
Also
sand
is
often
mixed
with
the
food
they
eat
The
gritty
sand
wears
down
the
teeth
Brain
eyes
ears
whiskers
are
some
of
the
body
parts
that
help
the
manatee
sense
the
world
The
manatee
ear
bones
are
large
and
their
hearing
is
believed
to
be
good
They
make
sounds
under
water
to
"talk"
to
each
other
The
sounds
are
like
chirps
whistles
or
squeaks
Most
of
the
sounds
they
make
are
too
low
frequency
for
humans
to
hear
Their
eyes
are
small
but
manatees
have
fairly
good
vision
They
can
tell
differences
between
sizes
of
objects
and
different
colors
and
patterns
The
manatee
snout
is
covered
with
whiskers
They
are
sense
organs
but
their
purpose
is
still
not
clear
It
is
believed
that
manatees
are
smart
To

Their
brain
is
very
large
and
has
lot
of
gray
matter
The
gray
matter
is
where
thinking
occurs
Manatees
can
learn
tricks
Breathing:
Although
manatee
can
stay
under
water
for
up
to
20
minutes
it
must
come
up
to
the
surface
to
breathe
air
When
the
manatee
reaches
the
surface
you
can
hear
the
air
blown
out
of
the
mouth
with
big
burst
of
air
Poof
Then
you
can
hear
the
fresh
air
being
sucked
in
Manatees
may
live
up
to
60
years
of
age
or
more
The
oldest
manatee
now
living
is
about
50
years
old
Manatees
have
no
natural
enemies
Sharks
and
alligators
do
not
usually
hunt
them
Most
premature
deaths
occur
from
cold
weather
and
disease
Fast-moving
boats
usually
kill
several
manatees
every
year
Fossils
of
manatees
found
in
Florida's
springs
have
been
estimated
to
be
about
45
million
years
old
Fossils
found
in
other
parts
of
the
world
may
be
as
old
as
60
million
years
The
modern
manatees
evolved
from
four-footed

Cyril

Vyvyan
Cy
is
supine
on
the
floor
of
the
Jebel

having
fainted
while

with
Vyv
all
the

"Cyril,"

"Ohhh,"
he
moans
as
he
recognizes
Vyv
"My
dear
was
in

like

and
everything
smelled
so
astringently

Cy
and
Vyv
had
been
arguing
about
Cyril's
obsession
that
others
think
he
smells
bad
After
an
11-hour
flight
from

his
rumpled
mind
confused
the
oliferous
perspiration
of
bodies
in
the

and

with
morbid
preoccupation
with
his
own
age-specific
putrefaction
"Ever

dithers
Vyvyan
to
the

but
uncomprehending
young
guard
who
kneels
with
him
at
Cyril's
side
"He's
bonkers
about

On
the
flight
Cyril
was
seated
next

Manatees
Dugong
and
Sea
Cow
This
order
of
aquatic
mammals
contains
two
Recent
families:
Dugongidae
for
the
genera
Dugong
(dugong
one
species)
and
Hydrodamalis
(Steller's
sea
cow
one
species
extinct);
and
Trichechidae
for
the
single
genus
Trichechus
(manatees
three
species)
The
dugong
inhabits
coastal
regions
in
the
tropical
parts
of
the
Old
World
but
some
individuals
go
into
the
fresh
water
of
estuaries
and
up
rivers
Steller's
sea
cow
occurred
in
the
Bering
Sea
being
the
only
recent
member
of
this
order
adapted
to
cold
waters
Manatees
live
along
the
coast
and
in
coastal
rivers
in
the
southeastern
United
States
Central
America
the
West
Indies
northern
South
America
and
western
Africa
Sirenians
are
solitary
travel
in
pairs
or
associate
in
groups
of
three
to
about
six
individuals
Generally
slow
and
inoffensive
they
spend
all
their
life
in
the
water
They
are
vegetarians
and
feed
on
various
water
plants
They
are
the
only
mammals
that
have
evolved
to
exploit
plant
life
in
the
sea
margin
(Anderson
1979)
The
ordinal
name
Sirenia
is
related
to
the
supposed
mermaidlike
nursing
of
dugongs
(thought
to
be
the
origin
of
the
myths
of
the
sirens)
and
manatees
The
only
reliable
observations
of
nursing
in
manatees
however
have
revealed
that
the
young
suckle
while
the
mother
is
underwater
in
horizontal
position
belly
downward
P
K
Anderson
(1984a)
reported
that
suckling
in
the
dugong
is
somewhat
similar
but
that
the
calf
usually
is
in
an
inverted
position
The
Sirenia
often
are
classified
together
with
the
Proboscidea
and
Hyracoidea
in
the
mammalian
superorder
Paenungulata
The
geological
range
of
the
order
Sirenia
is
early
Eocene
to
Recent
The
earliest
fossils
are
from
Hungary
and
India
By
the
middle
Eocene
the
order
was
present
in
southeastern
North
America
the
West
Indies
southern
Europe
northern
and
eastern
Africa
and
south-central
Asia
and
three
distinct
families--the
Dugongidae
Prorastomidae
and
Protosirenidae--had
evolved
(Dawson
and
Krishtalka
1984;
Domning
Morgan
and
Ray
1982)
These
aquatic
mammals
were
apparently
more
abundant
from
the
Oligocene
to
the
Pliocene
than
they
are
now
Their
comparative
scarcity
at
the
present
time
probably
results
from
climatic
changes
in
the
Pliocene
and
Pleistocene
and
more
recently
exploitation
by
humans
for
food
hides
and
oil
The
number
of
individual
sirenians
remaining
in
the
world
perhaps
60,000
is
far
smaller
than
that
of
any
other
mammalian
order

barely
escaped
from

Death
in

Europe
they
called
themselves
'poor

'good

They
rejected
the
sacramental
system
without
worrying
about
excommunication
They
said
'I
am
poor
boy
or
girl'
instead
of
'I
am
poor
man
or
woman'
to
emphasize
their
humility
(?)
and
spoke
impersonally:
'it
is
said
to
you'
instead
of
'I
say
to
you.'
They
all
were
'followers
(and
imitators)
of
Christ

the

which
was
way
of
indicating
they
disdained
Church
hierarchies
and
followed
their
own
collective
mystical

Terror
in
Cologne2
In
the
crypt
under
the
cathedral
at
Aachen
under
torture
Siegfried
confesses:
He
knew
it
was
the
anti-depressants
the
SSRIs
but
he
couldn't
remember
when
he'd
last
enjoyed
sex
He'd
gotten
off
the
plane
in
Havana
was
met
by
Dionisio
and
had
taken
him
to
bed
as
soon
as
they
got
to
's
casa
particular
Dionisio
rubusto
in
his
piel
de
canela
rubbed
his
penis
against
him
kissing
deep
as
he
could
and
masturbated
himself
to
orgasm
feeling
embarrassed
at
how
long
it
took
and
how
his
descending
balls
were
thrown
around
by
the
rapid
and
almost-painful
flying
grip
That
was
more
than
year
ago
and
he'd
only
jerked
off
few
times
since
He
was
occasionally
surprised
by
spacetime
warps
of
desire
And
what
had
love
felt
like?
"Keep
him
awake
all
night,"
Ollie
growls
"He's
going
to
give
up
all
of
it!"
As
he
thought
about
it
now
he
thought
his
sexual
appetite
had
never
lasted
more
than
about
fifteen
minutes
at
time
He'd
had
that
fifteen
minutes
with
thousand
men
but
that
had
been
about
it-what
satisfied
him
as
well
as
he
could
remember
The
sex
he
first
had
was
with
himself
R___
G___
had
taught
him
to
jack
off
around
age
13
and
he'd
refused
to
69
with
Ricky
T___
and
that
other
kid
V___
because
he
didn't
like
the
smell
of
V's
crotch
Now
he
confessed
the
smell
was
his
own
He
had
grown
increasingly
concerned
about
his
own
smell
worried
about
whether
his
gas
leaks
and
pissy
underwear
offended
others
as
he
was
certain
the
tobacco
odors
of
packs
per
day
did
"Try
stripping
him
and
leaving
him
in
cold
shower
for
while-that'll
get
him
singing,"
says
the
man
in
black
He'd
always
had
boyish
way
that
drew
stronger
protective
types
He'd
enjoyed
that
so
much
that
he'd
never
learned
to
be
anybody
else
He'd
always
been
drawn
himself
to
the
iron-willed
drag
queen
Tanye
and
others
who
were
boldly
exotic
They
were
badges
he
would
put
on
to
make
himself
authentic/
Years
of
criticism
and
self-criticism
had
made
him
more
adept
at
the
presentation
of
self
as
sympathetic
friend
to
women
to
Blacks
and
Latinos
He
took
seriously
the
generosity
with
which
Others
(especially
Black
women)
granted
him
the
right
to
exist
Race
and
position
in
hierarchy
of
gender/sexuality
had
always
been
the
most
important
markers
in
his
sexual
adventures
He
was
glad
he'd
had
them
but
anxious
when
he
asked-or
was
asked-whether
he
had
any
authentic
self
of
his
own
"We're
not
sure
this
old
guy
has
any
authentic
self
of
his
own,"
reported
the
junior
black-suit
to
Ollie
South
"He's
telling
us
great
deal
but
his
guilt
is
hard
to
prove."
"Never
mind
the
proof
that's
for
sissies
and
appeals
courts,"
South
tells
the
interrogators
"Just
keep
him
talking
Try
the
drugs."
He
knew
by
now
the
question
had
to
be
answered
with
yes;
after
all
he
did
choose
within
the
limitations
of
history
and
genetics
And
he
also
knew
the
question
and
its
answer
taken
together
were
trap
sucking
him
into
an
illusory
comparison
of
selves
reifying
an
idea
that
did
him
no
good
and
could
only
add
to
all
the
negative
feelings
of
deficiency
he
confused
himself
with
He
knew
there
is
no
authentic
self
as
there
is
no
God
as
ther
is
no
deep
reality
as
Niels
Bohr
used
to
tell
him.l
But
it
was
hard
work
to
remember
there
is
no
authentic
and
his
political
comrades
and
their
revolutionary
project
had
helped
keep
all
that
at
only
barking
distance
He
couldn't
remember
anymore
what
it
was
like
to
love
anyone
let
alone
love
the
people
"His
consciousness
is
clearly
shattered
under
the
yage,"
South
was
certain
"Now
for
the
sodomizing
humiliations."
He
wasn't
sure
he
could
remember
how
people
talk
to
each
other
He
was
always
impatient
with
friends'
recitations
of
their
daily
ins
and
outs-who
did
them
wrong
and
how
they
recouped
their
self-regard
or
not
He
thought
such
talk
was
trivial
and
tried
to
not
tell
such
tales
even
to
himself
It
was
difficult
for
compulsive
repeater
who
was
used
to
saying
over
and
over
some
phrase
or
song
that
caught
in
his
mind
He
understood
now
that
nothing
happened
unless
he
wanted
it
to
The
humblings
must
have
been
something
he
wanted
and
the
unhappinesses
he'd
thought
stemmed
from
his
deficiencies
were
feelings
he'd
obviouswly
cultivated
And
somehow
few
years
ago
he
began
to
take
the
pills
and
everything
changed
He
was
no
longer
so
sure
he
was
an
unhappy
person;
in
fact
he
felt
pretty
richtig
most
of
the
time
and
his
brain
was
freer
to
think
and
play
If
that
happened
because
he
swallowed
an
organic
chemical
it
must
mean
his
mind
in
its
ceaseless
processing
must
have
been
interpreting
in
particular
way
way
that
he
no
longer
had
to
experience
His
unhappiness
was
an
interpretation
that
was
not
necessary;
he
could
just
as
well
be
patient
and
observant
mindful
of
how
his
narration
of
the
extended
recent
time
did
not
require
that
he
feel
his
life
was
unhappy
He
tried
to
say
"I'm
doing
ok
things
are
ok."
He
tried
to
say
"I
notice
that
feel
down
that
the
world
seems
futile
and
tiring
especially
in
the
morning."
And
"I
notice
that
my
mind
is
engaged
and
ticking
more
productively
later
in
the
day."
And
"I
notice
that
sleep
lot
and
maybe
that
is
compensation
for
reduced
REM
or
deep
sleep
on
account
of
sleeping
pills."
And
"

My

have
been
reading

about
you
and
the
old
man
named
Mr
Siegfried
Rheinfahrt
We
are
writing
to
ask
you
to
stop
torturing
him
and
to
to
release
Mr
Rheinfahrt
and
Mr
Joseph
Jamal
They
are
good
people
and
you
should
not
be
abusing
them
Mr
South
know
you
worked
for
the
US
Government
in
Iran
and
Nicaragua
and
now
help
our
Brave

by
questioning
people
in
Kabul
Guantanamo

But
you
are
not
helping
Our

by
taking

of
the

with

Sex
should
be

always

that
we
say
"Okay"
before
we
have
sex
with
him
or
go
to
the
basement
for
chastisement
(By
the
way
it
is
done
the
right
way-nuns
whip
the

and

whip
the
girls.)
When
they
put
The
Question
to
us
always
answer
"Yes"
politely
so
get
the
cat
o'nine
tails
which
feels
lot
more
fun
than
the
cane
think
you
should
follow
our
example
And
then
let
them
go
because
they
have
always
said
"Okay"
to
having
sex
maybe
even
with

confronted
with
photo
of
himself
naked
simulating
receptive
anal
sex
with
Jamal
atop
the
supine
body
of
Rheinfahrt
In
very
large
capitals
the
accompanying
text
reads
US
Pull
Out!
Apologize
to
the
Sodomized!
Moral
Is
as
Moral
Does!
"Let
Jamal
go,"
he
barks
to
the
assistant
lapping
his
thighs
Release
him
drugged
and
well-dressed
at
the
ramp
to
the
Autobahn
No
German
will
give
him
ride
They'll
think
he's
Turkish."
"What
about
the
old
man?"
Memory
floods
the
synapses
with
message
once
sung
to
him
(by
or
or
?):
Yes
it's
love
offer
you
and
hope
that
you
will
keep
This
love
you
see
is
true
from
me;--but
no-it
is
to
weep
For
you-pale
white-cannot
trust
love
from
whom
you've
loved
too
long
And
yet
deride
with
untaught
pride-myh
love
is
far
too
strong
So
what
thing
can
offer
you?
What
gift
is
there
to
give?
Not
even
dreams
or
so
it
seems-for
you
refuse
to
live
So
this
offer
now
to
you
is
weak
with
right
and
wrong-
Half
dark
half
light
half
black
half
white-a
truly
Bastard
Song.60

Siegfried
as

In

he
and
his

during
their

writhing
with
Heisenberg
they
agreed
on
the
Copenhagen
Interpretation:
The
world
we

around
us
is
real
enough
but
everyday
phenomena
are
themselves
built
not
out
of
phenomena
but
out
of
an
utterly
different
kind
of
being
Wernie
Heisenberg
told
me
'The
hope
that
new
experiments
will
lead
us
back
to
objective
events
in
time
and
space
is
about
as
well
founded
as
the
hope
of
discovering
the
end
of
the

in
the
unexplored
regions
of
the
Antarctic.'

"In

"Freddie

as

he

having

in
an

They

away
from

The

to

of

and
imagine

Timmy
is
more
taken
with
the

and
self-portrait
of

in

photographed
around
1892
However
his
absorption
in
the
eyes
of
Edvard
is
disrupted
when
he
hears
of
the
abduction
"The
old
German
and
Joseph
Jamal?
What
happened?
Are
they
ok?"
"Herr
Rheinfahrt
was
found
at
death's
door
under
the
apse
at
Aachen
but
Joseph
is
still
missing
We
sent
letters
to
the
security
company
asking
them
to
release
him
He's
wanted
fugitive
so
we
can't
contact
the
police."
"I've
got
to
find
him
He's
the
only
one
who
can
possibly
tell
me
what
happened
to
Ana
K."
"Yeah
the
story
of
her
previous
life
was
just
picked
up
by

over
here."
"So
where
is

What
am
gonna
do?"
"Get
to
Cologne
that's
the
closest
city
There
can't
be
that
many

Timmy
is
frantic
through
the
fog
of
majoun
so
generously
provided
by
the
Sheikh
who
insists
on
being
called
Beaky
("It's
short
for
something
you'd
never
be
able
to
pronounce
my
dears.")
Unclear
about
geography
he
accepts
his
uncles'
guidance
and
suitcase
full
of
opium
and
flies
off
to
Cologne
Marcel
stays
behind;
the
Sheikh
and
his
friends
love
to
watch
his
fair
Gallic
skin
get
sunburned
and
peel
Meanwhile
Joseph
is
picked
up
by
vanful
of
Turks
on
their
way
to
the
Eau
de
Cologne
factory
with
load
of
bergamot
oranges
"We
thought
you
were
one
of

shouts
the

over
the
roar
of
five
lower
gears
"What
is
the
matter
with
you?
You
smell
like
fried
chicken
Is
that
blood?"
After
lengthy
and
difficult
explanations
in
pidgin-German
Joseph
is
taken
to
guestworkers'
hostel
in
the
suburbs
and
cleaned
up
As

"Oh

You

"Lots

we

"Anyway

Timmy

"But

"All

As
he
falls

Timmy
wants

Dedicated
to
the
Memory
of
Siegfried
Rheinfahrt
My
memory
is
really
bad
appreciate
your
dedication
The
thing
most
can't
remember
is
how
woman
feels
inside
I've
felt
nothing
lower
than
my
heart
for
years
64
The
author
admits
he
made
Siegfried
Rheinfahrt
up
Siegfried
isn't
even
his
real
name
He
was
christened
in
St
Nicholas
Church
in
Leipzig
in
1908
as
just
ordinary
John
Jacob
Jingelheimer
Schmidt
but
people
would
all
shout
at
him
As
chorister
the
boy
would
have
sung
the
works
of
the
Church's
most
famous
kappelmeister
JS
Bach
He
often
referred
to
this
music
as
the
"architecture
of
life,"
meaning
that
Bach
provided
structure
for
his
understanding
during
the
complex
changes
he
was
to
face
throughout
long
and
difficult
The
first
documentary
evidence
of
his
name
change
is
in
his
membership
card
in
Der
Eigene
physical
strength
group
with
intellectual
ties
to
Goethe's
seminal
romantic
novel
Werther
His
youthful
enthusiasm
for
camping
and
nude
swimming
left
him-although
not
his
liaisons
with
English
upper-class
homosexuals
one
of
which
is
thinly
disguised
in
Spender's
The
Temple--
as
Deutschland
grew
darker
His
thought
as
recorded
in
his
journals
during
his
years
at
the
University
in
Freiberg
was
first
inflamed
by
the
cult
around
Stefan
Georg
but
far
more
illumined
by
Hesse's
Journey
to
the
East
Although
his
philosophical
studies
show
his
great
love
and
aptitude
for
Heidegger
then
professor
soon
to
be
Rector
at
Freiberg
remembers
an
increasing
discomfort
with
H's
"swooning
for
leader"
who
would
throw
himself
and
the
people
into
the
Dasein
He
is
said
by
classmate
to
have
urinated
on
the
library's
holograph
of
Also
Sprach
Disenchanted
unwilling
to
accept
"the
hysterical
mystifications
of
right-wing
graecophiles,"
Rheinfahrt
left
his
studies
and
under
the
swaying
of
Christopher
Caudwell
he
joined
the
Communist
Party
in
1928
Comrades
from
that
time
equivocate
but
refuse
to
agree
to
his
description
of
himself
as
physically
repellent;
they
note
his
honey-blond
hair
worn
slightly
too
long
and
asking
for
the
discipline
of
good
brushing
well-developed
physique
and
mind
quick
to
discern
tactical
opportunities
in
the
contestations
with
the
emerging
Nazi
movement
Viewers
may
catch
glimpse
of
him
as
he
speaks
to
crowd
of
Berliners
evicted
from
their
homes
in
Brecht's
semi-documentary
Kuhle
Wampe
Unlike
many
of
his
peers
Siegfried
was
convinced
by
1932
that
the
Nazis
would
take
state
power
in
order
to
save
capitalism
for
the
German
bourgeoisie
and
its
English
investors
He
disappeared
faking
his
death
at
the
hands
of
Brown
Shirts
in
riot
in
Berlin
and
embarked
for
Moscow
for
military
and
political
training
Although
independent
corroboration
is
not
to
be
had
journal
entry
in
1936
makes
evident
that
he
was
back
in
Germany
involved
with
Lutheran
minister
whom
we
know
only
as
Dietrich
B___
His
recollection
is
that
"Dietrich
and
worshiped
with
great
fervor,"
although
he
smiles
as
if
to
ssay
this
is
not
to
be
taken
seriously
from
Comintern-trained
atheist
It
may
reflect
S's
disquiet
about
his
sexual
proclivities:
he
writes
sad
record
of
longing
and
vacillation
in
his
two-year
courtship
of
certain
Karen
Danish
psychoanalyst
and
his
almost
immediate
divorce
from
her
after
their
marriage
in
1938
Despite
considerable
effort
expended
by
the
author
no
clarity
as
to
the
identity
or
subsequent
fate
of
Karen
can
be
offered
here
The
precipitous
rejection
may
have
been
followed
by
more
dangerous
events
as
Karen
is
said
to
be
of
Russian
perhaps
Jewish
extraction
The
name
Siefried
appears
frequently
after
that
time
in
the
Soviet
archives
of
clandestine
operatives
Recently
released
and
decoded
the
papers
indicate
leading
role
for
Rheinfahrt
in
the
armed
resistance
to
the
Nazis
within
Germany
Some
scholars
may
denigrate
the
efforts
and
the
role
of
the
Communists
in
the
resistance
but
the
prominence
of
Rheinfahrt
is
certainly
the
reason
why
he
was
to
emerge
as
major
figure
in
the
liberated
Democratic
Republic
of
Germany
What
marks
Rheinfahrt's
activity
in
the
Party
and
Government
in
(East)
Germany
is
the
frequent
criticisms
and
self-criticism
he
underwent
Apparently
was
not
enthusiastic
about
the
transfer
of
industrial
assets
to
the
Soviet
Union
and
he
is
probably
the
unnamed
party
leader
who
was
sent
twice
for
proletarian
internationalist
education
to
Moscow
He
returned
each
time
chastened
but
quickly
involved
in
new
controversies
During
debates
over
development
of
Leipzig's
huge
chemical
plants
is
known
to
have
said
"We
don't
want
to
stink
up
our
country
for
all
future
generations."
He
was
finally
sent
to
Lubeck
on
the
Baltic
coast
where
he
oversaw
harbor
and
shipping
operations
He
married
his
cook
after
she
sustained
cerebral
infarction
in
1974
Much
of
his
writing
of
the
time
speaks
fondly
of
Helga:
My
shriveling
crabapple:
am
fond
of
you
Your
coffee
and
cigarettes
smell
dirty
to
me
And
regret
that
am
inadequate
in
love
It
is
not
difficult
to
discern
hidden
in
this
little
poem
an
expression
of
great
regret
that
he
felt
himself
inadequate
in
love
Found
among
the
secret
file
of
his
papers
is
photograph
from
1973
taken
on
beach
of
nude
young
man
draped
over
Trabant
photo
that
he
must
have
treasured
as
he
brought
it
with
him
into
exile
when
he
left
Germany
in
1980
He
has
lived
in
series
of
residential
hotels
since
that
time
eking
out
his
days
with
faithful
friend
as
he
nears

Whales
were
first
terrestrial

Who
intelligently
abandoned
Dusty

Freed

Until

Greedy

Now
the

Venison
Bride
becomes
prophet
Born
in
December
of
1948
Venison
Bride
grew
up
in
the
Cornish
section
of
Manistique
spending
most
of
his
youth
looking
dreamily
from
the
cliffs
over
Lake
Superior
vaguely
persuaded
that
something
special
was
coming
his
way
"The
Wells
Fargo
Wagon"
always
had
special
poignancy
for
him
as
did
the
underwear
ads-no
any
ads
for
men's
clothing
(few
in
True
and
Argosy
but
plentiful
in
Esquire.)
He
was
precociously
literary
having
found
Clifton
Fadiman's
Lifetime
Reading
Plan
at
age
11
in
revolving
paperback
display
at
the
drugstore
while
awaiting
his
orthodontist
appointment
He
read
all
the
Great
Books
dutifully
racing
to
find
out
how
each
ended
annoyed
at
the
peculiarities
of
style
that
made
Stendhal
different
from
Balzac
or
Homer
from
Virgil
He
learned
from
another
volume
in
the
same
display
that
his
sexual
fantasies
about
the
crew-cutted
athletes
in
his
school
were
not
normal
and
that
they
had
name;
in
fact
he
was
most
devastated
to
learn
that
his
urinary
appendage
had
name
and
different
function
and
he
cried
in
embarrassment
upon
learning
"penis"was
the
accepted
name
for
what
he
and
his
brothers
were
taught
to
call
the
"wetter."
And
"vagina"
was
too
confounding
altogether
Having
no
sisters
never
having
caught
his
mother
without
her
girdle
he
was
not
so
sure
where
this
vagina
was
located
or
what
it
did
Ignoring
it
all
was
by
far
the
best
course
he
concluded
Venison
was
named
by
his
mother
who
thought
her
son
had
"freakish
gamey
look."
His
father
sarcastic
reformed
drunk
predicted
that
"he'd
have
an
odd
taste
not
like
ordinary
meat,"
and
it
was
true:
like
all
Scandinavians
his
sweat
was
sharp
and
acrid
combination
of
genetics
and
overindulgence
in
rutabagas
and
lutefisk
He
exhibited
only
the
qualities
of
meat
from
the
town's
frozen
food
locker
none
of
the
grace
or
equanimity
of
the
live
animal
and
had
the
look
of
one
larded
with
strips
of
fat
through
his
flesh
and
ready
for
roasting
He
spent
all
his
summer
days
in
the
woods
moving
from
mossy
stumps
to
damp
rocks
He
liked
the
uprightness
of
the
third-generation
piney
woods
following
deer
trails
he
would
look
up
to
the
cathedrals
of
the
forest
with
longing
to
worship
something
even
the
spare
sunlight
between
the
rain-laden
clouds
scudding
over
from
the
Lake
His
reading
had
brought
him
to
Alan
Watts
and
he
imagined
himself
Zen
hermit
sketched
with
sumi-e
brush
in
fuzzy
lines
in
woody
cleft
between
limestone
walls
Far
better
to
think
of
himself
as
hermit
in
bosky
seclusion
than
rejected
overweight
and
soggy
egghead
In
his
dreary
high
school
Ven
felt
himself
isolated
and
befriended
only
his
teachers
making
mentor
and
confessor
out
of
recent
graduate
of
the
heavily-Finnish
Houghton
Tech
who
taught
physics
and
chemistry
Mr
Nuola
wore
his
flaxen
hair
in
flattop
and
neglected
to
shave
the
fine
hairs
that
grew
at
the
top
of
his
Mongolian
cheekbones
rendering
him
more
manly
in
Venison's
eye
and
even
less
resistible
in
the
eyes
of
the
a-line
skirted
girls
who
gazed
with
confusing
desire
at
the
porcelain
skin
revealed
in
the
hollow
between
his
clavicles
under
starchy
not-quite-expertly
ironed
collars
and
too-narrow
bow
ties
Chemistry
was
Venison's
meat
He
loved
making
banana
smells
of
esters
and
quickly
moved
on
to
more
complicated
organic
molecules
It
was
short
run
from
there
to
the
distillation
of
epinephrine
from
Drixan
inhalers
and
growing
taste
for
perspiring
gasping
conversations
with
his
only
friend
Ambrose
Broussard
very
dark
French
Canadian
originally
Indian
farmboy
Ambrose
suffered
from
obsessive-compulsive
tendencies
often
walking
backwards
for
miles
to
erase
what
had
happened
earlier
on
the
same
route
It
was
he
who
led
Venison
to
the
loft
above
the
horse
stalls
for
long
heart-to-hearts
and
masturbation
as
summer
rains
raised
the
smells
of
damp
hay
and
animal
excretions
Ven
and
Amby
wrote
away
for
morning
glory
seeds
and
explored
their
higher
consciousness
with
the
aid
of
IFIF
and
the
Native
American
Peyote
Church
to
which
Ambrose
had
legal
claim
to
belong
trudging
through
deep
snows
out
onto
the
ice
crags
to
peer
into
the
fluorescent
blue
water
unfrozen
underneath
It
was
while
staring
into
the
impossibly
deep
waters
of
Lake
Superior
that
Venison
received
the
first
intimations
of
his
special
mission
and
of
mankind's
aquatic
mammalian
peers
He
learned
that
humans
were
hairless
because
they
were
originally
aquatic
apes
able
to
evolve
into
standing
bipeds
with
the
aid
of
the
buoyant
waters
of
the
ages
when
they
first
emerged
from
the
arboreal
ecosystems
that
had
limited
them
to
chimp
socialities
In
his
speed-reading
he
also
happened
on
early
studies
of
neuro
anatomy
and
found
himself
zeroing
in
on
the
hypothalamus
(hÂ´Â´pthlÂ´ms)Â (KEY)Â 
an
important
supervisory
center
in
the
brain
rich
in
ganglia
nerve
fibers
and
synaptic
connections
It
is
composed
of
several
sections
called
nuclei
each
of
which
controls
specific
function
The
hypothalamus
regulates
body
temperature
blood
pressure
heartbeat
metabolism
of
fats
and
carbohydrates
and
sugar
levels
in
the
blood
Through
direct
attachment
to
the
pituitary
gland
the
hypothalamus
also
meters
secretions
controlling
water
balance
and
milk
production
in
the
female
The
role
of
the
hypothalamus
in
awareness
of
pleasure
and
pain
has
been
well
established
in
the
laboratory
It
is
thought
to
be
involved
in
the
expression
of
emotions
such
as
fear
and
rage
and
in
sexual
behaviors
Despite
its
numerous
vital
functions
the
hypothalamus
in
humans
accounts
for
only
1/300
of
total
brain
weight
and
is
about
the
size
of
an
almond.66
How
exciting
to
think
that
part
of
the
human
brain
was
evolved
from
the
fish
and
how
plausible
looking
past
the
gnostoc
into
the
cold
waters
of
the
Lake
that
humans
would
be
happier
if
they
lived
there
without
the
elaboration
of
aggressive
behaviors
exhibited
by
the
savage
boys
in
gym
class
How
much
better
to
be
without
these
functions
and
to
live
as
the
sturgeon
once
did
in
these
waters
HIAWATHA'S
DEPARTURE
By
the
shore
of
Gitche
Gumee
By
the
shining
Big-Sea-Water
Level
spread
the
lake
before
him;
From
its
bosom
leaped
the
sturgeon
Sparkling
flashing
in
the
sunshine;
On
its
margin
the
great
forest
Stood
reflected
in
the
water
Every
tree-top
had
its
shadow
Motionless
beneath
the
water
Â Â O'er
the
water
floating
flying
Something
in
the
hazy
distance
Something
in
the
mists
of
morning
Loomed
and
lifted
from
the
water
Now
seemed
floating
now
seemed
flying
Coming
nearer
nearer
nearer
Â Â Was
it
Shingebis
the
diver?
Or
the
pelican
the
Shada?
Or
the
heron
the
Shuh-shuh-gah?
Or
the
white
goose
Waw-be-wawa
With
the
water
dripping
flashing
From
its
glossy
neck
and
feathers?
Â Â It
was
neither
goose
nor
diver
Neither
pelican
nor
heron
O'er
the
water
floating
flying
Through
the
shining
mist
of
morning
But
birch
canoe
with
paddles
Rising
sinking
on
the
water
Dripping
flashing
in
the
sunshine;
And
within
it
came
people
From
the
distant
land
of
Wabun
From
the
farthest
realms
of
morning
Came
the
Black-Robe
chief
the
Prophet
He
the
Priest
of
Prayer
the
Pale-face
With
his
guides
and
his
companions.67

The
World's
Best
Shopping
"We
can
outfit
any
expedition
here
Dubai
has
the
world's
best
shopping,"
said
Cyril
to
Timmy
and
Joseph
as
they
walked
through
the
marble
and
gold
portals
of
Jebel
Ali
Free
Zone
"Complete
with

you

them

Mobe

"You

of

carried
on

King
of
Khush
If
we
could
hire

strapping
Mameluks
that
would
be
the
ticket!"
exclaimed
Vyvyan
"How
nice
of
the
Canadians
to
make
vehicle
much
more
comfortable
than
the
Bradley--safer
too!
And
Timmy
will
be
out
of
the
sun."
"David
and
Bathsheba!"
"What's
that
one
with
Omar
Khyyam?"
"Cleopatra!
We're
doing
Egypt
not
Persia
silly
old
pig!"
"Fayyum!
Let's
have
encaustic
portraits
done!
Big
eyes!
Like
Keane!"
"Where
are
we
going?"
asked
Tim
"Nairobi
of
course,"
Cyril
answered
"Mobe
has
some
work
to
do
there
so
he
and
Ferd
have
to
fly
We
will
be
on
safari
following
the
path
of
Stanley
and
Livingston
Here
we
are
the
offices
of
Empire
Sattelite
Uplinks
and
Security
You
remember
Bikki
from
Oslo
don't
you?"
Timmy
thought
he
recognized
the
pretender
to
the
throne
of
Onan
changed
out
of
his
gold
lame
shorts
now
djellaba-ed
and
kaffiya-ed
who
greeted
Cyril
and
Vyvyan
with
firm
handclasp
and
bow
"You
can
get
nice
date
milkshake
and
we'll
join
you
at
the
pearl-encrusted
fountain
over
there
in
little
while
Timmy
dear."
Whispered
Vyvyan
shooing
Timmy
toward
Akbar
and
Jeff's
Majoun
and
Date
Oasis
next
door
"And
Joseph
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
ask
the
Medecins
Sans
Frontiers
people
upstairs
how
much
food
we
are
taking
to
Darfur
for
them?
How
much
water
how
much
dry
tonnage
and
how
many
security
guards
we
will
need?
We
can
go
to
El
Geneina
if
they
wish
but
that
area
is
said
to
be
stifling
under
Janjaweed
Thanks
ever
so
."
Suddenly
they
were
thrown
to
the
ground
by
the
Sheikh's
bodyguards
who
started
firing
their
automatics
at
two
men
in
black
Prada
suits
across
the
way
"Get
down
get
down!
It's
WSO!"
Flipping
forward
in
the
air
the
Prada
men
came
on
raking
the
area
overhead
with
uranium-jacketed
bullets
shattering
the
glass
fronts
of
the
Empire
SUS
offices
Mall
security
guards
and
the
Sheikh's
men
surrounded
their
master
as
well
as
Cy
Vyv
and
Joseph
pulling
back
toward
the
elevator
to
the
bunker
underground
grenade
rolled
Prada-wards
and
exploded
deafening
everyone
and
spraying
expensive
black
microfibers
through
the
pierced
and
gilded
ceramic
arabesque
gratings
at
the
doors
of
Akbar
and
Jeff's
Tim
was
struck
by
portion
of
one
WSO
assailant's
head
When
the
bloody
lump
rolled
to
the
floor
Tim
recognized
the
remaining
profile
from
the
night
of
sex
at
the
Hotel
Real
Desert
He
wondered
again
how
all
these
people
were
connected
"Well
dears,"
said
Bikki
"I
think
we
had
better
rethink
the
plans."
Cyril
was
firm
"No
it's
much
safer
in
the
desert
than
across
the
Straits
and
through
Iran
to
Karachi
But
Timmy
and
Joseph
we're
so
sorry
but
you
will
have
to
miss
the
safari
think
How
about
this:
you
go
back
to
Paris
and
help
our
friends
get
their
daughter
to
Buenos
Aires?
The
Sheik
agreed
adding
"I
will
send
couple
of
men-Neddy's
brothers
Chesterfield
and
Butterfield-along
just
in
case
As
for
you
my
old
schoolmates
mightn't
it
be
better
to
make
your
way
through
Yemen
and
then
ferry
across
to
Djibouti?'
"Oh
had
such
good
weekend
in
Djibouti
years
ago
of
course,"
sighed
Vyvyan
in
reminiscence
"Remember
dear
the
French
fort
and
the
French
letters?"

Observations
of
the
Omniscient
Narrator
Ferd
Eggan
the
author
not
the
character
in
this
novel
sits
naked
at
the
computer
He
finds
his
writing
blocked
It's
always
something!
My
eyes
hurt
and
they're
blurry."
He
smokes
many
cigarettes
He
wants
to
write
clear
exhortation
to
his
peers:
voting
for
Kerry
is
only
an
unpleasant
first
step
in
genuinely
worthwhile
project:
he
wants
to
argue
that
world-historical
changes
require
that
we
accede
to-nay
accelerate-the
decline
and
fall
of
the
United
States
as
global
power
Pulling
the
last
puff
on
Marlboro
Menthol
Ultra
Light
before
the
filter
burns
he
thinks
"My
idea
is
complex
and
it's
hard
to
make
this
argument
coherent."
He
stubs
out
the
cigarette
and
clicks
on
the
draft
of
No
Matter
Who
Gets
Elected
"I
should
cut
away
all
the
digressions
here,"
he
breathes
out
with
the
thin
smoke
He
doesn't
have
much
time
today
as
his
friend
Mary
(a
model
for
MonaLisa
of
the
Desert)
is
coming
down
from
the
central
coast
and
Walt
another
friend
may
join
them
for
dinner
"Walt's
always
making
plans
and
canceling
always
cancel
too
so
shut
up."
He
looks
at
the
draft
"I
liked
that
little
recitative
by
Ilia
in
Idomeneo.68"

But

cannot
deny
his

up
more
Is
it
me
or
what?
Back
to
the
draft."
After
trip
to
the
toilet
and
worry
about
bladder
problems
he
sits
down
and
lights
another
cigarette
Here
he
looks
at
the
draft
of
his
argument
America
Over69
Yeah
yeah
we
should
act
to
vote
out
the
Bush/Cheney
war-mongers
but
let's
act
for
something
better
and
bigger
Iraq
is
not
just
waste
of
lives
over
an
oilfield
Iraq
is
strategic
battlefield
where
ordinary
young
Americans
hoping
for
education
and
escape
from
the
suffocation
of
ordinary
American
lives
fight
young
Iraqis
who
hope
for
something
very
similar
Inexperienced
naive
fighters
are
pitted
against
each
other
one
side
to
maintain
the
present
corporate
world
order
and
the
other
to
replace
it
And
it's
not
fight
just
between
Iraqis
and
Americans
Global
market
conflicts
overwhelm
any
national
power:
look
at
Sudan
Russia
Indonesia.70
No
matter
who
gets
elected
on
Nov
2
neither
Kerry
nor
Bush
will
ever
dare
to
address
the
most
important
issue:
what
is
America?
Our
homeland?
No
it's
military
and
political
shield
operating
to
dominate
the
global
market
market
that
doesn't
care
what
ordinary
Americans
want
Bush
and
Kerry
both
use
the
rhetoric
of
American
security
and
American
power
but
neither
will
admit
that
it's
not
even
about
this
country
America
as
great
nation
is
over
We
were
maybe
maybe
weighing
the
ideals
(and
the
failures)
of
Jefferson
and
Lincoln
and
all
country
that
embodied
greatness
once
But
we
are
not

Hey
What
Happened?
We
the
people
who
used
be
so
productive
were
lulled
out
of
our
vitality
by
corporate
grasping
and
by
big
demand
for
US
goods
and
US
dollars
until
the
stock
market
took
its
dreadful
dive
in
2000-2001
Prosperity
was
of
course
not
spread
equally
among
us:
the
average
income
declined
but
corporate
income
skyrocketed
to
the
top
Most
American
working
people
have
clung
to
belief
in
future
that
afforded
home
college
for
the
kids
insurance
even
for
domesticated
partners--until
the
US
economy
was
converted
from
production
of
goods
to
production
of
money
and
financial
equities
That
future
was
little
like
an
LA
garden
all
exotic
plants
tended
and
watered
by
people
and
resources
brought
from
across
the
borders
Now
not
just
our
jobs
but
even
our
money
has
gone
overseas-to
countries
that
actually
produce
things
All
America
can
offer
is
flex-time
service
work
that
only
immigrants
can
afford
to
take
Even
the
soldiers
are
taking
pay
cuts
because
of
outsourcing
It
Looks
Bad
So
instead
of
despair
over
the
loss
of
good
old
America
let's
take
compassionate
look
at
the
whole
planet:
living
creatures
nearly
ruined
cherished
moral
and
religious
ideals
perverted
into
family
values
and
competing
hostile
forces
that
nations
can
not
control
stronger
more
secure
America
is
nostalgic
fantasy
And
we
cannot
expect
to
negotiate
our
way
out
of
continual
wars
either
because
we
blindly
let
corporations
sell
our
birthright
for
mess
of
oil
and
silicon
chips--they
use
up
all
the
bargaining
chips
Neither
Kerry
nor
Bush
neither
good
cop
nor
bad
cop
can
pacify
let
alone
rectify
this
mess
What
do
we
do
now?
Voting
out
Bush
and
Cheney
could
stimulate
worldwide
ideals
of
freedom
democracy
and
peace
We
will
be
more
secure
if
we
dismantle
America
and
open
the
whole
garden
We
can
fight
for
global
order
that's
fits
for
this
earth
based
on
the
desires
we
share
with
all
people
everywhere
Things
worth
fighting
for
right
now:
No
Borders!
(no
border
defense)
Free
Health
Care
for
Everyone!
(nobody
will
need
insurance
companies)
Free
Child
Care
for
Everyone!
(any
mother
or
father
can
work
and
every
child
can
feel
secure)
Never
mind
that
these
are
utopian
ideas:
the
demands
themselves
move
people
to
realize
that
if
these
basic
human
needs
were
met
then
competition
for
scarce
resources
would
diminish
And
they
can
be
met
abundantly
from
the
incalculable
wealth
we
produce
together
on
this
earth
"I
hope
this
says
something,"
Ferd
says
to
himself
"I
grant
that
it
does
matter
whether
it's
an
avowed
fundamentalist
Christian
militarist
or
liberal
who
might
be
more
malleable
on
issues
but
Christ
Almighty!
What
poop
Kerry
is!"
He's
not
confident
that
his
argument
addresses
what
he
feels
is
an
underlying
problem;
he
wants
to
show
that
it's
ok
to
love
this
place
while
fighting
for
new
global
order
that
does
away
with
American
superpower
It's
sad
isn't
it?
What
we
love
is
here
in
this
place
Where
we
are
alive
we
learn
to
love
the
scene
the
settings
in
which
we
are
conscious
Unnoticed
all
the
people
and
trees
and
sidewalks
make
place
country
which
we
consider
central
to
the
experiences
we
have
Their
centrality
might
be
illusory;
after
all
what
we're
really
attached
to
is
our
consciousness
our
aliveness
But
mental
processes
become
affect
our
bodies
and
our
brains
do
that
in
this
place
and
we
call
our
place
America
We
need
to
find
some
way
to
keep
the
love
but
to
give
up
the
fatal
connection
to
power
to
glory
The
republic
of
liberty
at
least
the
hope
and
the
struggle
for
liberty
that
marked
the
best
of
American
days
is
no
longer
to
be
We
mistook
our
best
ideals
for
dominance
Maybe
our
canny
self-reliant
spirit
our
ready
smiles
and
readier
cash
overwhelmed
what
possibilities
of
mutual
aid
and
sympathy
we
possessed
early
on
We
leave

plain
"You

"I

In

under
Manistique

Venison
is
listening
to
the
intercepted
conversation
between
Oedipa
and
Lemmy
He
has
been
suspicious
of
her
since
she
began
to
show
signs
of
what
he
was
convinced
was
male
mind
She
was
bold
logical--nothing
like
the
females
he
wanted
for
Sirenia
The
insights
he
had
won
from
his
explorations
of
consciousness
made
Venison
very
clear
about
enemies:
he
summoned
Amby
and
the

of
Sirenia
bodyguards
"Get

Venison

BBC
World
News
tells
our
heroes
that
Kenyan
officials
have
no
intention
of
following
Mugabe's
example
in
Zimbabwe
Uprooting
the
ranchers
government
officials
said
would
be
disastrous
for
the
economy
which
relies
heavily
on
Western
assistance
and
on
tourism
major
source
of
hard
currency
On
top
of
that
acceding
to
the
Masai
might
encourage
similar
demands
by
the
scores
of
other
ethnic
groups
in
Kenya
many
of
which
have
historic
grievances
of
their
own
officials
added
In
special
program
produced
by
FOX
News
Africa
the
blustery
correspondent
interviews
wealthy
Kenyan
farmers
"The
young
warriors
move
in
and
cut
the
fences
and
bring
in
their
cattle,''
said
one
white
rancher
describing
the
recent
raids
in
northern
Laikipia
"You
get
between
5,000
and
10,000
head
of
cattle
on
your
land.''
He
called
for
firmer
action
against
the
trespassers
some
of
whom
are
from
the
related
Samburu
tribe
"The
police
need
to
be
harsher,''
he
said
"There
have
been
too
many
warnings
There
need
to
be
more
arrests
We
need
quicker
more
forceful
action.''
But
CNN
correspondents
praised
the
government:
"The
government
has
adopted
cautious
approach
to
land
reform
new
constitution
that
is
being
drafted
proposes
that
the
long
leases
granted
to
some
wealthy
ranchers
some
of
which
exceed
950
years
be
reduced
to
99
years
"Happy
Anniversary,"
Mobe
tells
Ferd
"It
seems
the
land
controversy
started
this
month
around
the
100th
anniversary
of
an
agreement
reached
between
British
colonialists
and
some
Masai
elders
The
deal
pushed
the
Masai
far
from
their
traditional
turf
in
the
Rift
Valley
where
railway
was
being
built
into
reservations
on
far
less
desirable
land
"Yes,"
replies
Ferd
booting
up
the
computer
plans
of
the
hospital
they
target
for
the
rescue
operation
"Signed
on
Aug
15
1904
with
the
illiterate
Masai
using
thumbprints
the
document
said
the
Masai
leaders
'of
our
own
free
will
decided
that
it
is
for
our
best
interests
to
remove
our
people
flocks
and
herds
into
definite
reservations
away
from
the
railway
line
and
away
from
any
land
that
may
be
thrown
open
to
European
settlement.'''
Mobe
asks
"Exactly
what
did
the
Masai
leaders
received
in
exchange?
As
the
years
have
passed
and
the
Masai
population
has
grown
(and
more
and
more
of
Africa
becomes
desertified)
rangeland
has
become
more
scarce
and
the
Masai's
precious
cattle
have
had
far
less
land
on
which
to
graze
Masai
leaders
say
the
agreement
ought
to
be
invalidated
because
their
predecessors
were
clearly
taken
advantage
of
by
the
white
settlers

in
moving
onto

"the

have
not
seized

But
they
have
destroyed
the

He

After

"Oh

shouts
Mobe
"It's
my
great-great
aunt
Karen!
If
she's

that
means
our

must
be

to
them!"
Karen
representing
WTO
tourist
interests
indicates
that
Kenya's
fragile
tourist
industry
has
been
hurt
in
the
past
by
fears
of
insecurity
The
Laikipia
area
is
growing
tourist
area
with
vast
private
game
ranches
Karen
tells
the
viewers
"The
Masai
have
played
an
essential
role
in
Kenya's
terrorism-I
mean
tourism--strategy
Of
Kenya's
50-odd
ethnic
groups
the
Masai
with
their
red
tunics
and
traditional
ways
are
the
best
known
They
perform
dances
at
lodges
across
the
country
in
which
they
chant
in
unison
and
leap
vertically
to
seemingly
impossible
heights
Tourists
also
frequently
visit
Masai
villages
that
highlight
their
age-old
way
of
life
in
which
all
land
is
considered
communal
and
cows
are
the
measure
of
wealth-very
ethnic,"
Karen
concludes
But
the
Masai
who
are
among
the
poorest
Kenyans
complain
"We
see
little
profit
from
tourism
and
that
many
of
the
people
who
dress
as
Masai
at
lodges
are
actually
from
other
tribes."
"We're
associated
with
wild
animals,''
complains
Roselinda
Soipan
Masai
lawyer
who
appeared
in
court
on
Tuesday
to
defend
some
of
the
protesters
rounded
up
in
Nairobi
"If
tourist
comes
to
Kenya
and
doesn't
see
Masai
it's
like
they
didn't
see
an
elephant
or
rhino
We're
human
beings
and
we
have
right
to
agitate
for
our
rights.''
We'd
better
hurry
with
our
plans,"
says
Mobe
"Our
little
caper
is
taking

dream
you
may
stray
and
lose
your
way
home
You
ask
someone
to
show
you
how
to
return
or
you
pray
to
God
or
Buddhas
to
help
you
but
you
still
can't
get
home
Once
you
rouse
yourself
from
your
dream-state
however
you
find
that
you
are
in
your
own
bed
and
realize
that
the
only
way
you
could
have
gotten
home
was
to
awaken
yourself
This
[kind
of
spiritual
awakening]
is
called
"return
to
the
origin"
or
"rebirth
in
paradise."
It
is
the
kind
of
inner
realization
that
can
be
achieved
with
some
training
You
would
be
making
serious
error
however
were
you
to
assume
that
this
was
true
enlightenment
in
which
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
nature
of
reality
You
would
be
like
man
who
having
found
copper
gives
up
the
desire
for
gold

Background:
As
young
man
Johannes
Brahms
was
close
friend
of
Robert
and
Clara
Schumann
They
socialized
publicly
and
Johannes
was
often
in
the
Schumann
home
When
Robert
Schumann
died
Johannes
continued
his
friendship
with
Clara
Clara
Schumann
herself
renowned
pianist
gave
concerts
that
showcased
her
late
husbandÃ­s
work
to
support
herself
and
her
children
It
is
not
known
whether
Johannes
had
always
loved
Clara
or
if
the
affection
sprang
from
the
relationship
that
grew
after
RobertÃ­s
death
History
does
tell
us
that
Brahms
professed
his
love
for
Clara
though
they
never
married
For
more

each
of
these

Assignment
Choices:
1
Write
dialogue
that
might
have
taken
place
between
Clara
and
Johannes
after
RobertÃ­s
death
Begin
the
conversation
with
Brahms
confessing
to
Clara
that
he
loves
her
Use
your
imagination
Here
are
some
questions
to
get
you
started
thinking:
What
might
Brahms
say
to
Clara
to
first
open
up
the
subject
of
his
love
for
her?
Does
Brahms
propose
marriage
or
is
it
he
who
never
asks
rather
than
she
who
refuses?
What
might
have
been
ClaraÃ­s
reasons
for
not
marrying
Johannes
Brahms?
Was
she
still
in
love
with
Robert?
Did
Clara
fear
that
if
she
married
Brahms
that
it
would
be
too
awkward
to
continue
concertizing
with
RobertÃ­s
pieces?
Or
was
there
some
other
reason
she
refused
BrahmsÃ­
affection?

If
you
play
an
instrument
create
an
original
short
piece
that
Brahms
might
have
written
for
Clara
Consider
the
emotions
of
love
and
how
they
might
be
conveyed
through
the
music
Would
the
tempo
be
slow
and
the
tone
sad
because
love
is
unrequited
or
might
the
tempo
be
fast
and
furious
to
show
the
frustration
of
two
souls
that
never
connect?

"If

and

us
and
each

to

we

cause
the
implementation
in

which
the

True
democracy

are
here
in

tremendous
gathering

In

to
find
it
we
Africans
must
first
achieve
the
right
to
elect
our
own
representatives
That
is
surely
the
first
principle
of
democracy
We
are
the
only
race
in
Kenya
which
does
not
elect
its
own
representatives
in
the
Legislature
and
we
are
going
to
set
about
to
rectify
this
situation
We
feel
we
are
dominated
by
handful
of
others
who
refuse
to
be

God
said
this
is

Land
in

we

We
are
not
worried
that
other

are

with

in

we
insist
that
we
are

INITIATION
OF
BOYS
AND
GIRLS
THE
CUSTOM
of
clitoridectomy
of
girls
which
we
are
going
to
describe
here
has
been
strongly
attacked
by
number
of
influential
European
agencies-missionary
sentimental
pro-African
government
educational
and
medical
authorities
We
think
it
necessary
to
give
short
historical
background
of
the
method
employed
by
these
bodies
in
attacking
the
custom
of
clitoridectomy
of
girls
[Here
Jomo
Kenyatta
political
leader
of
Kenya's
independence
describes
the
context
in
the
integral
Kikiyu
culture
of
the
custom
of
clitoridectomy
of
girls
and
other
rituals
surrounding
it
as
well
as
initiation
ceremonies
for
boys
He
makes
it
clear
that
these
customs
functioned
to
make
young
people
part
of
community
religious
and
social
life
and
compares
them
to
Jewish
circumcision
He
also
makes
plain
the
contemptuous-and
contemptible-efforts
of
the
Scottish
Mission
to
destroy
all
"pagan"
customs
of
the
Kikyu
people.]
However
this
urge
for
abolishing
people's
social
custom
by
force
of
law
was
not
wholeheartedly
accepted
by
the
majority
of
the
delegates
in
the
Conference
General
opinion
was
for
education
which
would
enable
the
people
to
choose
what
customs
to
keep
and
which
ones
they
would
like
to
get
rid
of
It
should
be
pointed
out
here
that
there
is
strong
community
of
educated
Gikuyu
opinion
in
defence
of
this
custom
In
the
matrimonial
relation
the
rite
de
passage
[rite
of
passage]
is
the
deciding
factor
No
proper
Gikuyu
would
dream
of
marrying
girl
who
has
not
been
circumcised
and
vice
versa
It
is
taboo
for
Gikuyu
man
or
woman
to
have
sexual
relations
with
someone
who
has
not
undergone
this
operation
If
it
happens
man
or
woman
must
go
through
ceremonial
purification
korutwo
thahu
or
gotahikio
megiro-namely
ritual
vomiting
of
the
evil
deeds
few
detribalised
Gikuyu
while
they
are
away
from
home
for
some
years
have
thought
fit
to
denounce
the
custom
and
to
marry
uncircumcised
girls
especially
from
coastal
tribes
thinking
that
they
could
bring
them
back
to
their
fathers'
homes
without
offending
the
parents
But
to
their
surprise
they
found
that
their
fathers
mothers
brothers
and
sisters
following
the
tribal
custom
are
not
prepared
to
welcome
as
relative-in-law
anyone
who
has
not
fulfilled
the
ritual
qualifications
for
matrimony
Therefore
problem
has
faced
these
semi-detribalised
Gikuyu
when
they
wanted
to
return
to
their
homeland
Their
parents
have
demanded
that
if
their
sons
wished
to
settle
down
and
have
the
blessings
of
the
family
and
the
clan
they
must
divorce
the
wife
married
outside
the
rigid
tribal
custom
and
then
marry
girl
with
the
approved
tribal
qualifications
Failing
this
they
have
been
turned
out
and
disinherited
[Some
Aspects
of
the
Ceremonies]
Late
in
the
afternoon
an
arch
of
banana
trees
and
sugar-canes
is
built
at
the
entrance
of
the
homestead
of
the
matuumo
.To
start
the
race
ceremonial
horn
is
blown
At
this
point
the
girls
who
are
not
allowed
to
participate
in
the
race
start
out
walking
to
the
tree
escorted
by
group
of
senior
warriors
and
women
singing
ritual
and
heroic
songs
When
the
girls
are
near
the
tree
the
ceremonial
horn
is
again
sounded
this
time
indicating
that
it
is
time
for
the
boys
to
start
the
race
The
boys
then
start
running
in
great
excitement
as
though
they
were
going
to
battle
The
truth
is
it
is
really
considered
sort
of
fight
between
the
spirit
of
childhood
and
that
of
adulthood
ceremonial
racing
(
.)
determines
the
leader
of
that
particular
age-group
The
one
who
reaches
the
tree
first
and
throws
his
wooden
spear
over
the
tree
is
elected
there
and
then
as
the
leader
and
the
spokesman
of
the
age-group
for
life
It
is
believed
that
such
one
is
chosen
by
the
will
of
the
ancestral
spirits
in
communication
with
Ngai
and
is
therefore
highly
respected
The
mogumo
ceremony
occupies
only
short
time
As
stated
above
the
boys
climb
the
tree
break
the
top
branches
while
the
girls
collect
leaves
and
twigs
dropped
on
the
ground
These
are
later
tied
into
bunches
and
carried
back
to
the
homestead
to
keep
the
sacred
fire
burning
the
whole
night
and
also
to
be
used
in
other
rituals
especially
in
making
the
initiates'
beds
The
songs
rendered
by
the
relatives
and
friends
round
the
foot
of
the
tree
generally
pertain
to
sexual
knowledge
This
is
to
give
the
initiates
an
opportunity
of
acquainting
themselves
with
all
necessary
rules
and
regulations
governing
social
relationship
between
men
and
women
At
the
completion
of
kunna
mogumo
(breaking
of
the
sacred
tree)
the
boys
and
girls
are
lined
up
according
to
the
order
of
their
adoption
Here
ceremony
of
taking
the
tribal
oath
(muuma
wa
anake)
is
conducted
by
the
elders
of
the
ceremonial
council
The
initiates
promise
by
this
oath
that
from
this
day
onward
they
will
in
every
respect
deport
themselves
like
adults
and
take
an
responsibilities
in
the
welfare
of
the
community
and
that
they
will
not
lag
behind
whenever
called
upon
to
perform
any
service
or
duty
in
the
protection
and
advancement
of
the
tribe
as
whole
Furthermore
they
are
made
to
promise
never
to
reveal
the
tribal
secrets
even
to
member
of
the
tribe
who
has
not
yet
been
initiated
The
songs
they
sing
on
the
homeward
march
are
directed
towards
denouncing
all
things
that
are
not
fit
and
proper
for
any
adult
member
of
the
community
to
do
Moreover
the
phrases
embodied
in
these
songs
are
to
encourage
the
initiates
to
become
worthy
and
honourable
members
of
the
adult
community
into
which
they
are
to
be
graduated
At
the
end
of
the
ceremony
the
boys
and
girls
are
free
to
go
to
their
respective
homes
to
rest
until
next
morning
Care
is
taken
to
protect
them
from
anything
that
might
inflict
wounds
upon
them
as
the
shedding
of
blood
is
regarded
as
an
omen
of
ill
luck
The
initiates
are
guarded
the
whole
night
by
senior
warriors
against
outside
interference
In
every
home
ceremonial
doctor
(mondo-mogo
wa
mambura)
is
assigned
by
the
traditional
council
(njama
ya
kirera)
to
protect
the
initiates
against
any
possible
attacks
from
witchcraft
and
also
against
any
temptation
or
enticement
to
indulge
in
sexual
intercourse
.[
After
The
Girl
is
Operated
On]
At
the
time
of
the
surgical
operation
the
girl
hardly
feels
any
pain
for
the
simple
reason
that
her
limbs
have
been
numbed
and
the
operation
is
over
before
she
is
conscious
of
it
It
is
only
when
she
awakes
after
three
or
four
hours
of
rest
that
she
begins
to
realize
that
something
has
been
done
to
her
genital
organ
The
writer
has
learned
this
fact
from
several
girls
(relatives
and
close
friends)
who
have
gone
through
the
initiation
and
who
belong
to
the
sane
age-group
with
the
writer
This
signifies
that
the
children
have
now
been
born
again
not
as
the
children
of
an
individual
but
of
the
whole
tribe
The
initiates
address
one
another
as
"Wanyu-Wakine,"
which
means
"My
tribal
brother
or
sister."
When
the
ceremony
is
completed
all
burst
into
ritual
song
They
bid
farewell
to
one
another
and
then
leave
the
homestead
under
the
escort
of
their
relatives
On
the
arrival
at
their
respective
homes
sheep
or
rat
is
killed
by
the
parents
to
welcome
them
home
again
and
anoint
them
as
new
members
of
the
community
(koinokai
na
kohaka
mwanake
or
moiretu
maguta)
At
this
ceremony
the
parents
are
provided
with
brass
ear-rings
as
sign
of
seniority
This
is
done
when
the
first-born
is
initiated
With
such
limited
knowledge
as
they
are
able
to
acquire
from
their
converts
or
from
others
who
invariably
distort
the
reality
of
the
irua
in
order
to
please
them
these
same
missionaries
pose
as
authorities
on
African
customs
How
often
have
we
not
heard
such
people
saying:
"We
have
lived
in
Africa
for
number
or
years
and
we
know
the
African
mind
well."?
This
however
does
not
qualify
them
or
entitle
them
to
claim
authority
on
sociological
or
anthropological
questions
The
African
is
in
the
best
position
properly
to
discuss
and
disclose
the
psychological
background
of
tribal
customs
such
as
irua
etc.
and
he
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
acquire
the
scientific
training
which
will
enable
him
to
do
so
This
is
point
which
should
be
appreciated
by
well-meaning
anthropologists
who
have
bad
experience
in
the
difficulties
of
field-work
in
various
parts
of
the

Primeval
After
manfully
squeezing
his
nose
to
unseat
particularly
intractable
blackhead
pressing
the
flesh
to
the
tearful
point
where
he
was
forced
to
consider
that
the
incipient
rosacea
there
might
be
making
the
rhynodermis
too
thick
tougher
that
it
had
been
when
he
was
quite
frequently
used
to
squeeze
in
his
lubricated
more
comedogenic
youth
Ambrose
Broussard
pulled
down
his
underwear
kicked
when
the
briefs-as
they
always
did-caught
on
his
moccasins
and
sat
down
on
the
toilet
His
buttocks
seemed
to
hurtle
past
their
usual
resting
point
and
collided
with
little
padding
to
diminish
the
impact
as
his
flesh
had
gone
the
way
of
lipodystrophy
with
the
cold
white
rim
of
the
toilet
man
alone
can
easily
neglect
to
lift
the
seat
although
Ambrose
had
recently
replaced
the
unhygienic
seat
left
behind
by
the
previous
tenant
with
pristine
pink
one
which
he
thought
made
whimsical
match
with
the
pink
tiles
on
the
bathroom
walls
yet
he'd
never
been
moved
to
harmonize
the
blue
color
of
the
floor
tiles
perhaps
because
he'd
painted
above
the
tile
wainscoting
in
semi-gloss
aubergine
he
thought
was
further
inspired
choice
When
he
hit
the
rim
he
was
pleased
that
he
was
able
to
ejaculate
"Holy
Shit!"
within
microseconds
of
contact
congratulating
himself
on
the
miniscule
time-lapse
between
pain
signals
and
an
apposite
rejoinder
Having
feared
just
this
kind
of
undignified
clapping
of
tender
skin
onto
the
chilly
and
narrow
porcelain
he
was
wont
to
leave
the
seat
down
until
recently
when
it
became
redolently
clear
that
tiny
droplets
of
urine
were
deliquescing
to
burden
the
air
with
the
fug
of
public
latrine
There
was
no
completely
agreeable
solution
except
permanent
vigilance
In
any
case
after
replacing
the
seat
and
spreading
his
anal
pore
his
disappointment
at
the
quantity
and
texture
of
the
waste
he
pushed
out
was
mollified
only
when
very
organized
plume
of
gas
was
emitted
followed
by
much
more
gratifying
elongated
extrusion
of
shit
and
final
firm
fart
that
enabled
the
distended
belly
to
regain
some
smoother
roundness
The
unhindered
egress
of
his
excreta
permitted
Ambrose
moment
of
reflection
regarding
the
toilet
as
the
biological
altar
where-not
unlike
the
deep
connection
with
Nature
inherited
from
his
Native
American
forebears--through
autonomic
muscular
contractions
and
flexions
of
the
organism
one
performed
the
ritual
of
self-worship
in
which
the
very
alimentary-eliminative
tubular
configuration
of
the
human
body
was
experienced
most
to
resemble
that
of
other
animals--fundamentally
In
fact
the
coincidence
of
the
English
adverb
connoting
radical
excavation
of
the
underlying
ground
of
animal
life
with
the
noun
denoting
the
bottom
part
of
the
human
body-not
counting
the
lower
extremities-entered
his
mind
spiced
with
mild
frisson
of
pride
at
the
"primitive"
adaptation
that
efficaciously
coordinated
involuntary
peristaltic
motion
and
voluntary
bearing
down
and
pushing
to
achieve
evacuation
The
sensation
of
clean
unopposed
extrusion
along
with
the
bombast
of
flatulence
and
the
highly
parabolic
presentation
of
urine
through
the
manually
guided
penis
was
pleasurable
in
the
extreme
wreathed
with
smells
that
one
could
not
deny
were
olfactory
tokens
of
life
of
healthy
inward-
and
out-ness
although
only
one's
own
could
be
granted
this
status
and
exempted
from
the
general
disgust
others'
bodily
excrescences
could
awaken
in
one
if
they
originated
from
any
of
the
rest
of
us
Ambrose
had
like
many
warriors
of
the
spirit
had
occasion
to
taste
this
matter
but
his
palate
rejected
the
ugly
bitter
flavor-so
surprisingly
intolerably
different
from
its
fetid
and
rich
olorousness--and
he
concluded
that
despite
the
alluring
abjection
it
most
theatrically
might
otherwise
offer
coprophagia
would
never
be
his
choice
at
the
banquet
table
of
infantile
sexual
fixations
Meditating
on
the
high
estimation
Pascal
placed
on
frequent
and
copious
defecation
enjoying
especially
the
more
vernacular
version
of
the
triadic
encomium
to
"good
shoes
?.
and
warm
place
to
shit"
(what
was
that
other
priority
he
couldn't
remember?)
Ambrose
turned
his
attention
to
more
rigorous
exigencies
of
the
present
situation
That
is
he
remembered
he
was
entrusted
by
the
Big
Humpback
Himself
to
bring
in
the
suspicious
Oedipa
for
testing
Hopping
over
the
cold
tiles
disregarding
creeping
neuropathic
foot
pain
attributable
once
again
to
what
were
blithely
called
medication
side-effects
he
therefore
gave
himself
shake
eschewed
wipe
preferring
the
prospect
of
warm
lavage
and
turned
on
the
shower
lighting
cigarette
to
enhance
the
waiting
time
while
the
hot
water
made
its
way
from
the
distant
heater
to
his
bathroom
When
all
was
right
he
tossed
his
butt
into
the
toilet
and
lathered
and
scrubbed
Ambrose
Broussard
knew
about
what
were
called
"two-spirited"
among
the
anthropological
queers
who
wanted
to
authenticate
their
own
proclivities
and
choices
and
he
felt
strong
antipathy
at
the
prospect
of
eliminating
Oedipa
Moreover
his
early
support
for
his
sworn
blood-brother
Venison's
visionary
schemes
had
diminished
sharply
in
the
last
several
months
as
the
white-turbaned
flocks
of
converts
increased
and
Ven
took
on
the
vocal
tones
of
incipient
madness
Ambrose
stalked
out
to
his
vehicle
feul-cell
equipped
hybrid
Hummer
roared
to
the
edge
of
the
compound
and
swept
Oedipa
away
with
minutes
to
spare
before
the
Fruit
of
the
Sea
armed
security
arrived
"What
the
fuck
are
you
doing?"
demanded
Oedipa
"Let
me
out
of
here!"
"The
Killers
are
coming
for
you
and
me
too
now
that
I'm

We'll

"That's
ridiculous,"
Oedipa
shot
back
"What

What
for?
And
there
is
no
train
any
more."
"I
mean
we'll
drive
to
Seney
through
Blaney
Park
and
ditch
the
car
at
Seney
That's
what
mean."
"What
are
you
talking
about?
don't

and
I'm
not

you

Take
me
back
to

"Look
don't
go
all
ignorant
on
me
I'm
Ambrose
The
Killers
are
Venison's
Fruit
of
the
Sea
They're
after
you."
"Why
would
they
be
after
me?"
Oedipa
asked
"Yeah
wonder,"
Ambrose
was
getting
impatient
"They
might
want
to
check
out
Sirenia
disciple
who
wasn't
what
she
said
she
was?"
When
there
was
no
answer
to
that
he
asked
"Just
who
are
you
anyway?
You're
really
guy
eh?"
"No!"
she
retorted
"What's
it
to
you
anyway?"
"I'm
sick
of
Venison
and
I'm
saving
your
ass
That's
what's
it
to
me."
They
said
nothing

until
they
stopped

at

The
Killers
The
door
of
Henry's
lunchroom
opened
and
two
men
came
in
They
sat
down
at
the
counter
"What's
yours?"
George
asked
them
"I
don't
know,"
one
of
the
men
said
"What
do
you
want
to
eat
Al?"
"I
don't
know,"
said
Al
"I
don't
know
what
want
to
eat."
Outside
it
was
getting
dark
The
streetlight
came
on
outside
the
window
The
two
men
at
the
counter
read
the
menu
From
the
other
end
of
the
counter
Ambrose
Broussard
watched
them
He
had
been
waiting
for
Oedipa
in
the
bathroom
"Fuck
it
give
us
four
fried
egg
sandwiches
to
go
We
gotta
go
Al."
"Fuck
it
ok
but
want
fries."
"Two
fries
four
fried
egg
sandwiches
right?"
George
asked
"Say
you're
pretty
bright
boy
eh?
Yeah
And
hurry
up
We
gotta
get
to
Manistique
fast."
Al
lit
cigarette
"Give
me
cup
of
coffee
now
though
"he
said
He
turned
toward
Ambrose
"What's
up
Chief?"
he
asked
Ambrose
"Nothing,"
Ambrose
picked
up
his
mug
and
swallowed
coffee
It
was
too
hot
but
he
swallowed
anyway
He
could
feel
it
burning
all
the
way
down
"That's
three-twenty-five,"
said
George
wrapping
the
sandwiches
in
waxed
paper
"Plus
twenty
five
for
the
coffee
three-fifty."
The
man
turned
back
to
look
at
the
paper
bag
of
sandwiches
"You
got
quarters
Al?"
Al
paid
and
the
men
left
Oedipa
came
out
from
the
bathroom
behind
the
counter
opposite
the
door
She
sat
on
the
stool
next
to
Ambrose
"Don't
look
now
don't
turn
around
Those
guys
are
The
Killers,"
Ambrose
said
"We're
lucky
they're
Florida
guys
and
don't
know
me
bet
they
know
what
you
look
like
though."
She
took
their
coffee
and
sandwiches
across
to
booth
She
motioned
for
Ambrose
to
sit
on
the
same
side
of
the
booth
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
George
the
counterman
to
overhear
"OK
um
Ambrose,"
she
said
Here's
the
deal
So
they're
after
me
I've
gotta
get
to
Sault
Ste
Marie
and
across
to
Canada
I'll
pay
you
to
drive
me
there."
"Nope
no
no
Soo
I've
got
powerboat
in
Deer
Park
We'll
go
across
the
Lake
to
Batchawana
Bay
And
you'll
pay
all
right."
"Whatever
you
want."
She
dropped
her
spoon
into
her
coffee
"Can
we
leave
now?"
As
they
walked
along
the
road
to
where
the
Hummer
was
hidden
Ambrose
pursued
his
questions
"Start
by
getting
real
with
me
No
forked
tongue
with
Indian!"
Oedipa
sighed
cleared
her
throat
and
began
"Get
in
start
the
car
I'll
be
right
there."
As
the
engine
turned
over
the
passenger
door
opened
Ambrose
barely
turned
to
see
her
Then
he
heard
startling
new
voice
"This
is
real
The
real
is
Achmed
Oedipus
bin
Maas
was
sent
here
to
stop
Sirenia
In
my
laptop
here
is
enough
to
send
Venison-and
you
if
you're
not
straight
with
me-to
hell."
"Hey
no
need
for
threats
ok."
I'm
here
right
saving
your
ass?
I'm
taking
you
to
Canada
right?"
"No
I'm
saving
your
ass
Deer
Park
is
out;
they
already
know
you'd
go
there
We're
going
to
Newberry
and
my
associates
will
be
waiting
in
Lake
Superior
Forest
Hit
the
road
Ambrose."
The
reader
is
here
instructed
to
imagine
these
two
as
if

were

characters

various

about
Nick
Adams

in

about

Pretend
"Big

is
an
idyll
in
the
escape
of
Ambrose
and
Achmed
Since
the
reader
is
undoubtedly
going
to
be
successfully
imaginative
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
detail
their
time
in
the
woods
Also
pretend
that
they
are
Atala
and
Rene
in
the
eponymous
novel
by
Chateaubriand
that
helped
start
the
romantic
revolution
in
literature
This
pretense
will
lend
the
present
narrative-and
by
metonymic
conjunction
the
romantic
novel
in
general--a
same-sex
erotic
charge
Last
pretend
that
they
embody
but
contradict

thematic

But

disproportionate
male-female
ratio
at

aquarium
some
of
the
females
flirt
profusely
and
dump
their
partners
for
single
males
with
better
nests
Wendell
and
Cass
however
take
no
part
in
these
cunning
schemes
They
have
been
completely
devoted
to
each
other
for
the
last
eight
years
In
fact
neither
one
of
them
has
ever
been
with
anyone
else
says
their
keeper
Stephanie
Mitchell
But
the
partnership
of
Wendell
and
Cass
adds
drama
in
another
way
They're
both
male
That
is
to
say
they're
gay
penguins
This
is
not
unusual
"There
are
lot
of
animals
that
have
same-sex
relations
it's
just
that
people
don't
know
about
it,"
Mitchell
said
"I
mean
Joe
Schmoe
on
the
street
is
not
someone
who's
read
all
sorts
of
biology
books."
One
particular
book
is
helpful
in
this
case
Bruce
Bagemihl's
Biological
Exuberance,87
published
in
1999
documents
homosexual
behavior
in
more
than
450
animal
species
The
list
includes
grizzly
bears
gorillas
flamingos
owls
and
even
several
species
of
salmon
"The
world
is
indeed
teeming
with
homosexual
bisexual
and
transgendered
creatures
of
every
stripe
and
feather,"
Bagemihl
writes
in
the
first
page
of
his
book
"From
the
Southeastern
Blueberry
Bee
of
the
United
States
to
more
than
130
different
bird
species
worldwide
the
'birds
and
the
bees,'
literally
are
queer."
In
New

it's
the

At
the
Central
Park
Zoo
Silo
and
Roy
two
male
Chinstrap
penguins
have
been
in
an
exclusive
relationship
for
four
years
Last
mating
season
they
even
fostered
an
egg
together
"They
got
all
excited
when
we
gave
them
the
egg,"
said
Rob
Gramzay
senior
keeper
for
polar
birds
at
the
zoo
He
took
the
egg
from
young
inexperienced
couple
that
hatched
an
extra
and
gave
it
to
Silo
and
Roy
"And
they
did
really
great
job
of
taking
care
of
the
chick
and
feeding
it."
Of
the
53
penguins
in
the
Central
Park
Zoo
Silo
and
Roy
are
not
the
only
ones
that
are
gay
In
1997
the
park
had
four
pairs
of
homosexual
penguins
In
an
effort
to
increase
breeding
zookeepers
tried
to
separate
them
by
force
They
failed
said
Gramzay.88

"Aggressosexual
behavior,"
the

explains
way
of
establishing
dominance
They've
been
keeping
it
from
us:
There
are
homosexual
and
bisexual
animals
ranging
from
charismatic
megafauna
like
mountain
gorillas
to
cats
dogs
and
guinea
pigs
There
are
transgendered
animals
transvestite
animals
(who
adopt
the
behavior
of
the
other
gender
but
don't
have
sex
with
their
own)
and
animals
who
live
in
bisexual
triads
and
quartets
Bruce
Bagemihl
spent
10
years
scouring
the
biological
literature
for
data
on
alternative
sexuality
in
animals
to
write
Biological
Exuberance:
Animal
Homosexuality
and
Natural
Diversity
768
pages
about
exactly
what
goes
on
at
"South
Park's"
Big
Gay
Al's
Big
Gay
Animal
Sanctuary
The
first
section
discusses
animal
sexuality
in
its
many
forms
and
the
ways
biologists
have
tried
to
explain
it
away
The
second
section
"A
Wondrous
Bestiary,"
describes
unconventional
sexuality
in
nearly
200
mammals
and
birds
--
orangutans
whales
warthogs

chaffinches.89
It
is
fundamental
Darwinian
principle
that
traits
and
behaviours
cannot
spread
over
evolutionary
time
if
they
reduce
an
individual's
personal
reproductive
success
To
be
more
precise
an
imaginary
species
consisting
only
of
individuals
with
an
exclusive
and
life-long
homosexual
behaviour
will
be
extinct
in
one
generation
Parthenogenetic
(virgin
birth)
species
do
exist
in
nature
they
consist
of
100%
females
but
100%
homosexual
species
has
never
been
found
Such
species
cannot
exist
Just
as
sterile
species
cannot
exist
What
does
exist
in
nature
are
species
with
up
to
10
percent
of
homosexuals
according
to
Bagemihl
But
even
this
is
puzzle
If
those
individuals
do
not
reproduce
evolution
theory
predicts
that
the
percentage
in
the
population
must
decrease
continuously
down
to
level
that
is
produced
by
new
mutations
But
we
observe
more
than
that
So
how
should
the
excess
be
explained?
One
possibility
is
bisexuality
the
combination
of
homosexual
and
heterosexual
behaviour
in
the
same
individual
But
this
cannot
be
the
answer
either
because
bisexual
individuals
will
produce
on
average
less
progeny
than
full-time
heterosexuals
So
the
existence
is
still
unexplained
Bagemihl
skilfully
demolishes
variety
of
explanations
for
homosexuality
proposed
by
biologists
This
is
one
of
the
best
and
interesting
parts
of
his
book
Probably
few
people
have
the
encyclopaedic
knowledge
of
homosexual
behaviour
in
animals
to
be
able
to
refute
the
variety
of
hypotheses
to
explain
(away)
homosexuality
In
the
end
Bagemihl
concludes
somewhat
surprisingly
that
homosexuality
has
no
function
it
just
is
Homosexual
behaviour
has
an
intrinsic
value.90

(12
Nov
Kenya
Times)
Witnesses
say
the
girl's
body
levitated
up
toward
the
ceiling
'Her
knees
were
bent
upwards
her
legs
still
spread
apart
her
arms
falling
limp
behind
her
as
the
sterile
drape
slipped
off
and
slithered
to
the
floor,'
reported
surgical
nurse
"I
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
make
my
ritual
incision,"
commented
Mrs
Adowe
Kikuyu
clan
leader
and
indigenous
medicine
practitioner
"Suddenly
the
ceiling
parted
and
she
went
to
heaven,"
her
aunt
said
sobbing
"It
was
miracle-God
called
her
to
prevent
my
niece
from
going
under
the
knife
in
that
godless
custom
don't
know
what
my
sister
and
brother-in-law
were
thinking
to
make
the
girl
go
through
with
such
thing
in
this
day
and
age.'
The
doctor
in
charge
was
not
available
to
speak
with
The

Cyril
put
down
the
Kenya
Times
and
chortled
little
in
his
glee
"Well
Vyv,"
he
said
"we've
done
it
By
now
she'll
be
in
the
air
heading
to
Paris
and
on
her
way
to
the

Real

"Caprice
Sithole
will
make
sure
she's
all
right,"
added
Vyvyan
"And
it's
time
we
got
back
there
too
hope
the

is
still
alive
as
we
can
be
very
helpful
to

think."
What
happy
reunion
they
all
made
back
at
the

Caprice
prepared

Cy

spent
an

before

by

Timmy
relieved
to

shouted
"God

But
not
everyone
was
as
blessed
as
Timmy
might
have
wished
He
learned
that
Herr
Siegfried
was
still
missing
presumably
in
Germany
somewhere
and
as
for
Joseph
well
Joseph
had
been
unmasked
as
an
impostor
just
after
leaving
Dubai
Apparently
an
operative
of
World
Security
Operations
had
been
transformed
through
complicated
cosmetic
surgery
and
planted
to
spy
on
them
all,
Vyvyan
said
tartly
"He
was
discovered
when
he
was
found
to
have
no
recollection
of
the
chord
changes
in
'Sophisticated
Lady.'
The
bad
news
however
is
that
the
real
Joseph
has
disappeared."
"No
I'm
afraid
not,"
Neddy
interjected
"Look
at
this
news
from
Fox-Europe."
There
on
the
television
was
Joseph
manacled
his
legs
in
shackles
being
led
off
an
airplane
in
Chicago
Illinois
The
Attorney
General
was
then
shown
announcing
that
long-time
fugitive
undoubtedly
connected
with
international
terrorism
had
been
caught
and
extradited
back
to

charges
in

The

thanked
Mr

Colonel)
Oliver
South
for
his
work
in
apprehending
"this
white-hating
cop-maiming

The
BBC
featured
Kenya
news
as
well
The
winner
of
the
Nobel

Prize
was
announced
to
be
Wangari
Maathai
Kenyan
activist
who
"founded
an
Africa-wide
movement
that
empowered

confronted
corrupt
officials
and
planted
millions
of
trees
in
ravaged
forestland
"Never
mind
that
she
thinks
AIDS
is
man-made
plague
to
kill
Africans,"
sneered
Caprice
"Sadly
she's
right
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
"It's
killing
us
and
the
conspiracy
is
among
the
rich
nations
(too
selfish)
and
the
poor
nations
(too
corrupt)
to
pay
for
medical
care
And
we
have
the
Catholics
and
the
Protestants
who
can't
agree
on
anything
united
in
condemning
people
for
their
sexuality
spit
on
Mugabe
and
Nujoma
and
all
of
those
fools!"
"Mama,"
her
daughter
Xoliswa
cried
"It's
because
of
the
history
of
colonialism
Kenya
and
Zimbabwe
have
the
same
problem
with
whites
robbing
us
of
our
land
And
Christian
values
are
what
we
need
All
the
Highlanders
football
stars
are
Christian
now."
"Ugh,"
Neddy
grunted
"My
uncle
was
Reverend
but
he
would
never
have
acted
like
Mugabe
And
he
would
have
negotiated
better
land
deals
He's
just
whipping
up
poor
farm
laborers
to
riot
because
he
won't
fight
the
agribusiness
giants
that
own
all
the
land
Same
as
in
Kenya."
"Affairs
in
Zimbabwe
are
our
task
Neddy
not
the
children's
They
are
practically
French
by
now,"
said
Caprice
bending
her
husband's
elbow
to
bring
the
champagne
glass
to
his
lips
again
In
attempting
to
turn
the
gathering
back
toward
festivity
she
urged
everyone
"Let's
leave
political
strategies
for
another
day
Look
we
have
little
Timmy
back
Cy
and
Vyv
are
well
our
new
niece
was
saved
from
cutting
And
hear
there
may
even
be
hope
for
Little
Baby
Nell."
"Heavens,"
invoked
Vyvyan
"we
have
to
appreciate
our
small
victories
and
work
to
expand
the
power
of
the
multitude
That
remains
our
mission
expect
we'll
soon
hear
from
some
friends
with
news
of
Lemmy
and
Achmed
as
well
for
one
will
breathe
an
effeminate
sigh
of
relief
when
this
go-round
is
over
and
we
can
move
on

The
feds
are
spying
on
and
harassing
political
activists
with
fury
not
seen
since
the
1960s
EARLY
THIS
MONTH
the
federal
government
launched
the
latest
crude
offensive
in
its
so-called
war
on
terror
Titled
the
October
Plan
the
program
called
for
"aggressive
even
obvious
surveillance"
of
wide
range
of
individuals
(regardless
of
whether
or
not
they're
suspected
of
any
criminal
wrongdoing)
until
the
Nov
presidential
election
according
to
an
internal
document
leaked
to
the
press
The
plan
collaboration
between
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
and
other
agencies
involves
renewed
scrutiny
of
mosques
and
interrogations
of
people
whose
national
origin
religious
faith
or
political
leanings
might
in
the
eyes
of
the
feds
indicate
even
the
most
far-flung
relationship
to
"terrorism."
Immigrants
and
others
interviewed
by
the
FBI
have
been
"questioned
about
immigration
status
theirs
and
others'
and
about
their
political
and
religious
views,"
the
National
Lawyers
Guild's
Stacey
Tolchin
said
at
an
emergency
press
conference
called
by
the
San
Francisco
branch
of
the
American
Arab
Anti-Discrimination
Committee
the
Bay
Area
Association
of
Muslim
Lawyers
the
NLG
and
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
of
Northern
California
For
staffers
at
these
organizations
responding
to
these
kinds
of
crackdowns
has
become
alarmingly
routine
This
is
the
fifth
round
of
FBI
"informal
interviews"
targeting
immigrants
based
on
their
national
origin
religion
and
increasingly
their
political
views
No
one
knows
just
how
many
have
been
deported
as
result
of
the
interviews
or
of
the
various
dragnets
conducted
over
the
past
three
years
Local
NLG
attorney
Nancy
Hormachae
reported
that
at
least
13,000
people
were
forced
into
deportation
hearings
as
the
result
of
the
notorious
Special
Registration
program
alone
And
the
fact
that
none
of
these
campaigns
has
proffered
single
al-Qaeda
operative
hasn't
deterred
the
Bush
administration
bit
So
far
immigrant
Muslims
and
those
from
the
Middle
East
and
Central
Asia
have
suffered
the
brunt
of
the
Bush
administration's
attacks
on
civil
liberties
But
as
NLG
immigration
attorney
Mark
Van
Der
Hout
told
me
"Going
after
immigrants
is
just
the
first
step
towards
going
after
U.S
citizens."
Indeed
look
at
the
past
three
years
shows
that
Attorney
General
John
Ashcroft's
offensive
has
widened
to
include
range
of
citizens
whose
only
real
crime
is
their
opposition
to
the
Bush
administration's
policies
The
FBI
comes
calling
President
George
W
Bush
Aschroft
and
company
have
made
it
easier
to
spy
on
everyday
citizens
without
probable
cause
of
criminal
activity
even
allowing
for
the
indefinite
detention
of
Americans
dubbed
"enemy
combatants,"
without
charges
or
access
to
lawyer
They've
eviscerated
laws
meant
to
keep
wall
between
the
CIA
and
the
FBI
and
erected
an
extensive
domestic-spying
infrastructure
enlisting
private
citizens
and
relying
on
private
industry
to
degree
never
seen
before
Today
federal
agencies
are
maintaining
grand
total
of
10
domestic
watch
lists
The
Bush
administration
has
shifted
federal
funding
away
from
traditional
law
enforcement
and
toward
domestic
spying
explained
John
Crew
an
attorney
with
the
ACLU
of
Northern
California
specializing
in
police
practices
and
surveillance
issues
"A
lot
of
this
activity
is
in
fact
being
carried
out
by
local
police
working
with
the
Joint
Terrorism
Task
Force,"
he
told
me
explaining
that
those
agents
are
considered
"federalized."
They
report
to
the
FBI
Local
city
officials
even
local
police
chiefs
are
often
not
aware
of
what
these
"special
officers"
are
doing
As
the
Bush
administration
loosened
professional
standards
for
law
enforcement
it
simultaneously
increased
financial
incentives
for
conducting
surveillance
Crew
continued
"To
qualify
for
grants
[local
law
enforcement]
must
have
organizations
in
their
locale
that
are
threats,"
he
said
"They
have
to
justify
their
own
budget
by
amplifying
the
threat
factor."
[
elision
of
many
examples
of
spying
on
activists]
Civil
liberties
watchdog
groups
obviously
worry
about
the
chilling
effect
these
kinds
of
surveillance
and
crackdowns
have
on
our
faltering
First
and
Fourth
Amendments
But
they
also
insist
that
Ashcroft
and
company's
approach
isn't
making
us
any
safer
When
law
enforcement
fails
to
distinguish
between
violent
criminal
activity
and
legitimate
dissent
and
when
it
favors
collecting
as
much
information
on
as
many
people
as
possible
rather
than
useful
intelligence
resulting
from
bona
fide
criminal
investigations
it's
"choosing
quantity
over
quality,"
Crew
said
"You
develop
good
leads
by
generating
trust
not
by
disrespecting
people's
rights...
[And]
if
you're
looking
for
needle
in
haystack
adding
more
hay
doesn't
help
any."
The
bills
that
have
recently
passed
through
the
House
and
Senate
in
response
to
the
9-11
Commission's
findings
reorganizing
intelligence
gathering
and
expanding
Big
Brother's
reach
even
further
into
our
everyday
lives
just
promise
more
of
the
same
"It's
during
times
of
fear
when
civil
liberties
are
most
at
risk,"
Crew
said

responsibility
of
these
officials
for
war
crimes
and
since

has
refused
to
join

Some
Convergences
Achmed
grabbed
Ambrose
at
the
shoulder
of
his
coat
and
pulled
so
that
they
were
sitting
very
close
together
each
able
to
look
over
the
other's
shoulder
to
monitor
any
approach
"We're
here
he
whispered
"No
unnecessary
moves
or
sounds
ok?
Handguns
only
although
don't
think
we'll
need
them."
"So
what
do
we
do
now?"
Ambrose
asked
"We've
had
no
lights
no
radio
or
cel
contact
and
silence
for
the
last
three
hours
"Yeah
pretty
peaceful
eh?"
He
pulled
off
his
watch
and
told
Ambrose
"Make
sure
everything
is
turned
off
no
electronics
no
metal
no
plastic
no
nothing."
Achmed
made
pile
of
all
their
gear
and
led
them
about
10
meters
closer
toward
the
lake
He
started
to
take
off
his
left
boot
and
whispered
to
Ambrose
Take
off
all
your
clothes;
strip
down
nude
nothing.
Just
lie
back
with
your
arms
open."
Ambrose
did
what
he
was
told
but
"Damn,"
he
thought;
"danger
is
turn-on
but
am
not
going
to
let
this
guy
fuck
me
out
here-on
the
run
get
my
ass
froze
off
or
shot
off."
"Don't
think
about
it
just
do
it,"
he
was
told
"It's
snowing
it's
getting
dark
and
it's
the
only
way
we
can
get
picked
up
by
the
infra
red
sensors."
Not
even
minute
later
tracer
bullets
flew
over
them
streaking
toward
the
lake
in
the
thickening
snowfall
"Don't
get
up,"
as
if
Ambrose
wouldn't
think
of
getting
up
but
it
did
cross
his
mind
to
raise
his
head
and
steal
look
at
Achmed
just
to
check
on
what
kind
of
toolkit
the
guy
was
operating
with
Achmed
yelled
now
over
the
gunfire
and
there
came
the
very
welcome
sound
of
camo-white
Kiowa
OH-58D91
lobbing
rockets
into
the
treeline
as
it
swooped
down
between
the
unseen
pursuers
and
our
heroes
A
In
matter
of
seconds
somebody
had
bundled
up
the
two
naked
men
and
strapped
them
into
the
helicopter
As
they
rose
and
headed
out
north
over
Lake
Superior
parting
round
of
rocket
fire
threw
humvee
into
the
air
behind
them
its
occupants
catapulted
up
flaming
and
then
down
hissing
in
the
snow
On
board
the
Kiowa
female
in
what
was
obviously
flight
gear
but
exhibiting
no
identification
wrapped
Achmed
and
Ambrose
in
thermal
blankets
and
started
iv
drips
to
rehydrate
them
pushing
in
dose
of
ativan
to
calm
frayed
nerves
but
instructing
them
to
be
conscious
of
long
slow
breaths
Satisfied
with
their
vital
signs
she
left
them
to
drift
while;
both
were
quiet
for
what
seemed
to
be
quite
long
time
until
the
same
female
reappeared
with
clipboard
and
cel
phone
"Printed

They

you."
Ambrose
was
surprised
when
she
handed
the
phone
to
him
When
he
pushed
the
talk
button
and
heard
voice
say
his
name
Ambrose
was
surprised
again
He
was
talking
not
to
Venison
whom
he
had
expected
to
hear
gloating
after
re-capturing
them
Instead
the
voice
seemed
British
and
cheerful
"Well
well
it
said
"good
Indian
expect
you
wonder
what
has
happened
and
who
we
are
who
are
whisking
you
away."
"Yes
am
answered
Ambrose
"I
gather
you
are
on
Achmed's
team,"
he
said
looking
over
at
the
man
who
had
turned
the
tables
on
him
switch-hitting;
first
damsel
in
distress
Ambrose
was
saving
from

now
man
with
powerful
connections
who
turned
around
and
saved
Ambrose
"Yes
you
could
say
that
said
the
voice
on
the
phone
"Achmed
is
highly-skilled
and
very
valuable
asset
to
our
team
You
could
say
he's
the
David
Beckham
of
the
gender
expression
team."
"Ok
guess
don't
know
who
that
is
and
don't
know
who
you
are
What
is
going
on
here?
Where
are
we
going?"
"My
name
is
Vyvyan
I'm
going
to
leave
it
to
Achmed
to
answer
most
of
those
questions
For
now
I'll
just
say
congratulations
on
your
resourcefulness
You
are
safe
now
in
good
hands
promise
you
And
you
are
going
after
few
stops
to
Argentina
It's
summer
there
now
so
expect
you'll

it
Now
will
you
please
give

Cheerio!"

"Welcome
to
this
year's
Shephard's
UV
North
America
Conference
and
Exhibition
Last
year
we
reviewed
Transformation
in
Action
This
year
we
examine
an
extension
of
this
philosophy
entitled
Global
Persistent
Surveillance
(GPS)
This
unique
and
new
warfighting
concept
underpins
the
massive
reorganisation
and
new
initiatives
impacting
both
the
operational
and
intelligence
community
capabilities
The
nature
of
the
threat
and
the
tempo
of
operations
demand
radical
departure
from
the
way
we
have
managed
information
flows
shared
products
and
provided
'actionable
information'
to
the
warfighter.Â 
Due
to
the
world-wide
global
set
of
threats
and
the
new
terrorist
threat
paradigm
GPS
is
national
imperative
for
both
national
and
tactical
intelligence
surveillance
and
reconnaissance
(ISR)
systems.Â 
UAVs
represent
an
efficient
and
effective
solution
to
provide
'cursor'
over
target
under
any
conditions
and
at
any
location.Â 
This
year
we
rightly
focus
on
GPS
for
our
conference
because
of
the
critical
role
UAVs
will
play
in
making
GPS
successful
strategy.Â

NingNong
an

elephant
that
works
on
the
beach
at

is
credited
by
little
English

with
saving
her
life

she
was
spending
her

yesterday

As
the

We
the
last
remnants
of
the
Catharists
here
in
Frankish
lands
(see
Chap
29)
face
persecution
from
Bernard
of
Clairvaux
In
particular
the
women
have
been
seized
and
burned
as
witches-all
part
of
the
male-supremacist
purge
of
women's
leadership
in
spreading
the
real
revolutionary93
news
of
the
gospels
The
dog
"saintly"
Bernard
has
denounced
the
theological
position
that
God
is
immanent
insisting
that
God
is
totally
transcendent
and
that
humaan
aspiration
to
unite
with
God
can
be
fulfilled
only
after
death
Margery
Kempe
and
others
have
roundly
defeated
this
argument
but
the
Church
cannot
face
congregation
that
understands
The
Knowledge
of
Good
and
Evil
We
call
on
future
generations
to
help
us
In
the
future
we
forsee
huge
peasant
rebellion
caused
by
widespread
dispossession
of
land
tilled
by
residents
and
sparked
by
new
reformation
of
religion
We
also
forsee
an
overthrow
of
the
ancien
regime
and
the
establishment
of
the
idea
of
rights
inherent
in
each
individual
person
Sadly
we
expect
that
one
superpower
will
tie
reformation
theology
and
ficticious
"rights"
into
license
to
rule
the
world
Martyrdom
is

Dear
Laura
How
delightful
to
have
yours
of
October
last
And
how
is
Siegfried
taking
your
new
liason?
During
the
meeting
of
the
International
Movement
for
Zion
last
night
was
reminded
of
you
Someone
mentioned
Husserl
who
had
forgotten
was
himself
Jew
but
got
himself
baptized
searched
Ideen
and
wrote
this
in
reaction:
The
I-Beam
Husserl
rightly
points
out
that
we
are
able
to
slide
up
and
down
the
pole
of
the
ego-beam
at
will
moving
now
toward
the
thing
now
away
from
it
to
consider
the
act
of
knowing
and
its
modalities
For
example
noematically
can
consider
certain
cat
who
probably
exists
but
then
can
turn
back
noetically
to
assess
the
degree
of
certitude
that
characterizes
my
consideration
of
that
selfsame
cat
as
existing
(#
105)
Now
if
we
were
to
slide
down
to
the
point
where
all
modalities
are
behind
us
on
the
noetic
side
of
the
pole
and
if
there
we
were
to
face
the
object
we
would
get
the
pure
sense
of
the
object
in
which
its
unity
is
given

best
to
Rosa
von

If
Time
Not
Space;
If
Space
Not
Time
In
Islington
on
rainy
Sunday
night
in
January
Cyril
Vyvyan
and
Ambrose
emerge
from
the
cinema
commenting
on
their
disappointment
with
What
the
Bleep
99
"That
film100
is
nothing
dear
boys,"
says
Cyril
"but
an
infomercial
for
particular
type
of
Buddhist
thought
which
has
seized
on
quantum
mechanics
as
an
explanation
for
their
theological
concern
with
consciousness
and
the
desire
to
shed
"the
ego"
in
order
to
be
at
home
in
the
new
construal
of
the
universe."
Willing
to
play
the
interlocutor
(not
unlike
Alan
Alda
in
science
programs
on
US
public
television)
Ambrose
asks
"but
don't
you
agree
that
matter
is
no
longer
to
be
thought
of
as
solid
and
stable
and
that
energy
is
what
makes
the
universe?"
"Let's
start
more
simply
ripostes
Cyril
"The
film's
expert-a
chiropractor
so
he
undoubtedly
has
the
scientific
background
to
comment
on
this-tells
us
that
functional
MRIs
show
the
same
areas
of
the
brain
are
active
when
looking
at
say
an
apple
as
when
remembering
an
apple
He
then
says
this
indicates
that
the
brain
cannot
tell
the
difference
between
what
is
real
and
what
is
only
remembered
Therefore
consciousness
is
constituting
reality
That's
just
bad
science!"
Vyvyan
sees
his
point:
"First
of
all
the
fMRI
is
not
precise
enough
to
show
that
the
very
same
neurons
are
active
in
both
cases
And
here's
the
car
Mind
your
umbrellas!
"Second
if
may
second
your
searchlight
brilliance
dear
Vyv,"
adds
Cyril
"the
film
assumes
that
consciousness
and
the
brain
are
coterminous
congruent
That
leaves
out
the
whole
rest
of
the
body
including
the
eyes
the
muscles
that
move
the
lenses
in
the
eyes
the
skin
of
the
hand
that
might
hold
the
apple-everything
else."
"Why
yes
of
course,"
muses
Ambrose
as
the
ancient
Bentley
coughs
sneezes
and
is
finally
underway
"That
means
that
the
assertion
about
consciousness
constituting
the
world
is
not
proven
by
that
argument
But
what
about
the
Heisenberg101
quote-'atoms
are
not
things'?
We
know
from
Bohr
and
others
that
the
act
of
observation
changes
phenomena:
observing
subatomic
particle
can
determine
either
its
location
or
its
momentum
but
not
both
In
fact
all
we
have
are
probabilities
for
where
any
given
particle
is
prior
to
observation:
it
could
be
everywhere
or
nowhere
"Theories
abound
darlings
to
explain
this
uncertainty
principle
but
the
purest
is
the
Copenhagen
consensus
right
Cyril
dear?"
That
there
is
no
thing
no
entity
we
can
call
matter
or
energy
or
reality
All
we
can
do
is
ascertain
probabilities
which
do
not
definitively
prove
anything
is
anywhere
Ambrose
interjects
"For
that
matter
it
doesn't
disprove
it
either."
Cyril
is
more
measured
"In
fairness
Bohr's
formulation102
that
there
is
no
thing
called
reality
is
not
the
only
way
to
see
the
universe
Einstein
might
still
be
right
that
God
does
not
play
games
David
BÃ¶hm103
sees
implicate
order
Most
scientists
are
agnostic
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
"real"
universe
out
there
independent
of
our
observation
of
it."
"The
best
that
can
be
said
is
that
observation
(and
we
could
stretch
and
call
that
consciousness
guess)
is
implicated
in
every
phenomenon
we
can
observe
and
seemingly
in
every
phenomenon
we
can
theorize
to
explain
Think
of
superstring
theories
and
the
like!"
"But
this
movie
goes
too
far;
it
wants
us
to
believe
our
consciousness
creates
reality
which
is
conventionally
Buddhist
but
it's
bad
Buddhist
doctrine
and
bad
science
together
It's
mare's
nest
of
post-Kantian
goo
that
is
far
to
keen
on
idealism."
"Well
my
Chingachgook
let
us
show
you
the
good
old
Berkeleyan
reality
of
an
English
dinner
We'll
go
to
an
Indian
restaurant
for
hot
curry!"
"Not
to
go
on
about
it,"
replies
Ambrose
"but
was
confused
by
the
discourse
on
addiction104
in
the
film
What
did
you
think
of
that?"
"Bah!"
Vyvyan
expostulates
We
are
told
by
that
Elke
Sommer
look-alike
with
beautiful
skin
and
blue
eyeshadow105
that
everything
we
like
or
dislike
is
an
addiction
but
if
we
take
hot
bath
we
are
transformed
and
can
throw
away
our
anxiety
medications."
"They
should
rather
have
said,"
agrees
Cyril
"that
anti-depressants
are
logical
outcome
of
theories
that
brain
chemicals
and
electrical
connections
among
neurons
are
the
seat
of
emotional
reactions
of
delight
and
distress
Readjustment
of
those
electro
chemicals
is
perfectly
marvelous
course
to
take
and
even
more
so-a
fortiori--
if
consciousness
is
all
somehow
quantum-based
addiction
chemistry?"
The
Bentley
pulls
up
on
Finchley
Road
in
front
of
popular
Indian
eatery
The
Indologist
"Let's
eat!
My
addicted
cells
(another
falsehood
that
the
cell
is
the
basic
unit
of
consciousness)
want
food
and
nice

Crimes
and

Globalization
"Look
at
this
proposal,"
said
to
Foucault's
nephew
(see
Chap
11)
"I'd
like
you
to
comment
on
my
ideas
for
the
class
am
teaching
at
the
Quan
Yin
Transgendered
Bodhisattva

"OK,"
replied
Marcel
but
warn
you

perverse
outlook
on

topics."
QUEER
CRIME
AND
GAY
GLOBALISM
Much
of
the
life
of
lesbians
gay
men
bisexuals
transgender
genderqueer
and
intersex
persons
has
been
illegal
and
this
illegality
has
been
constituent
factor
in
the
development
of
new
sub-cultures
economies
and
geographies
This
course
will
examine
some
of
the
ways
that
non/anti-normative
sexual
desire
has
created
new
modes
of
being
and
responded
to
the
Law
that
seeks
to
channel
desire
into
acceptable
activities
Prostitution
pornography
inter-generational
sex
drug
use
unsafe
sex
sexual
activity
in
public
or
private
are
"crimes"
said
to
characterize
"queer"
life
We
will
attempt
to
look
at
the
behaviors
and
beliefs
of
persons
seeking
sexual
and
emotional
connections
and
their
outcomes
in
modes
of
being
that
both
create
shared
subjectivities
and
build
institutions
These
institutions
have
challenged
the
structures
of
economic
and
social
life
with
resulting
transformation
and
incorporation
into
the
globalization
of
the
marketplace
Queer
outlaws
are
followed
by
LGBT
entrepreneurs
We
will
read
from
marxian
and
freudian
commentators
on
queer
desires
and
queer
cultures
including
contemporaries
like
Foucault
Butler
Bersani
Wittig
Beck
Also
we
examine
the
documentation
of
queer
legality
and
criminality
in
such
works
as
Times
Square
Red
Times
Square
Blue
Queer
Diasporas
The
Social
Construction
of
Gay
Drug
Resentment
The
Crystal
Diary
and

Sluts
In
addition
students
will
participate
in
original
research
on
sexual
subcultures
in
this
city
and
in
other
parts
of
the
world
Music
art
fashion
electronic
communication
and
self-help
(among
other
processes)
will
be
considered
as
QLGBT
strategies
to
create
their
lives
and
resist
oppression.

added
my

Class
Proposal
Queer
Cultures
of
the
60s
and
70s
In
this
multimedia
course
we
will
examine
the
Lesbian
Gay
Bisexual
Transgender--Queer
cultural
efflorescence
that
is
dated
from
the
street
riots
of
1969
around
the
Stonewall
Inn
in
New
York
The
origins
of
this
cultural
movement
in
Cold
War
economics
and
politics
and
the
emergence
of
vibrant
social
movements
of
African-Americans
Latinos
Women
and
youth
can
be
glimpsed
through
documentary
film
and
the
"underground"
press
of
the
times:
Chicago
Seed
Berkeley
Barb
RAT
and
East
Village
Other
In
literary
production
specifically
gay
male
writing
begins
with
Robert
Duncan
in
his
1949
"Manifesto"
and
Ginsberg
in
"Howl;"
both
became
icons
to
60s
gay
poets
Most
prominent
New
York
poets
were
Frank
O'Hara
James
Merrill
and
James
Schuyler
Lesbian
writers
like
Elizabeth
Bishop
Anne
Sexton
and
Muriel
Rukeyser
were
already
well
established
and
were
joined
by
feminist/bisexual
Beats
and
emerging
post-Stonewall
writers
like
Robin
Morgan
and
Audre
Lord
In
theater
Gay/Lesbian/Transgender
writers
and
performers
were
particularly
visible
The
high
camp
of
the
Theater
of
the
Ridiculous
and
the
anti-war
hippie
rock
dramas
of
the
pan-sexual
Fugs
will
be
looked
at
in
early
film
and
recordings
of
these
performances
as
well
as
films
by
Andy
Warhol
whose
decidedly
"queer"
Factory
was
the
most
significant
cultural
producer
of
the
second
half
of
the
century
Far
from
the
New
York
irony
of
Warhol
were
the
poetry
of
Duncan
Jack
Spicer
Judy
Grahn
and
Pat
Parker
The
gender-smashing
antics
of
the
Cockettes
in
San
Francisco
exemplify
the
collectively-made
often
anonymous
projects
that
contributed
to
the
development
of
the
gathering
as
an
art
form--beyond
the
Happening
lay
the
Be-In
and
drag
ritual
Writer/performers
and
film
artists
necessary
to
understanding
this
aesthetic
are
Jack
Smith
Kenneth
Anger
and
documentarians
of
demonstrations
and
"tribal"
gatherings
of
groups
like
the
Gay
Liberation
Front
Hundreds
of
new
"queer"
writers
began
their
careers
in

Lenin
quotes
an
objection
to
immediate
revolution:
'We
have
no
majority
among
the
people
and
without
this
condition
the
uprising
is
hopeless
.'
Lenin
retorts
"People
who
can
say
this
are
either
distorters
of
the
truth
or
pedants
who
want
an
advance
guarantee
that
throughout
the
wole
country
the
Bolshevik
Party
has
received
exactly
one-half
of
the
votes
plus
one
this
they
want
at
all
events
without
taking
the
least
account
of
the
real
circumstances
of
the
revolution
History
has
never
given
such
guarantee
and
it
is
quite
unable
to
give
it
in
any
revolution
To
make
such
demand
is
jeering
at
the
audience
and
is
nothing
but
cover
to
hide
one's
own
flight
from
reality

Jacob

fraudulently
obtaining

blessing
appears

have
been
inherited
by
his
latest
posterity
The
Edomites
peremptorily
refused
to
permit
the
Israelites
to
pass
through
their
land
For
period
of
400
years
we
hear
no
more
of
the
Edomites
They
were
then
attacked
and
defeated
by
Saul
and
some
forty
years
later
by
David
In
the
reign
of
Jehoshaphat
(BC
914)
the
Edomites
attempted
to
invade
Israel
but
failed
They
joined
Nebuchadnezzar
when
that
king
besieged
Jerusalem
For
their
cruelty
at
this
time
they
were
fearfully
denounced
by
the
later
prophets
After
this
they
settled
in
southern
Palestine
and
for
more
than
four
centuries
continued
to
prosper
But
during
the
warlike
rule
of
the
Maccabees
they
were
again
completely
subdued
and
even
forced
to
conform
to
Jewish
laws
and
rites
and
submit
to
the
government
of
Jewish
prefects
The
Edomites
were
now
incorporated
with
the
Jewish
nation
They
were
idolaters
Their
habits
were
singular
The
Horites
their
predecessors
in
Mount
Seir
were
as
their
name
implies
troglodytes
or
dwellers
in
caves;
and
the
Edomites
seem
to
have
adopted
their
dwellings
as
well
as
their
country
Everywhere
we
meet
with
caves
and
grottos
hewn

the

Female
genital
mutilation
(FGM)
is
the
term
used
to
refer
to
the
removal
of
part
or
all
of
the
female
genitalia
The
most
severe
form
is
infibulation
also
known
as
pharaonic
circumcision
An
estimated
15%
of
all
mutilations
in
Africa
are
infibulations
The
procedure
consists
of
clitoridectomy
(where
all
or
part
of
the
clitoris
is
removed)
excision
(removal
of
all
or
part
of
the
labia
minora)
and
cutting
of
the
labia
majora
to
create
raw
surfaces
which
are
then
stitched
or
held
together
in
order
to
form
cover
over
the
vagina
when
they
heal
small
hole
is
left
to
allow
urine
and
menstrual
blood
to
escape
In
some
less
conventional
forms
of
infibulation
less
tissue
is
removed
and
larger
opening
is
left
Girls
undergoing
the
procedure
have
varying
degrees
of
knowledge
about
what
will
happen
to
them
Sometimes
the
event
is
associated
with
festivities
and
gifts
Girls
are
exhorted
to
be
brave
Where
the
mutilation
is
part
of
an
initiation
rite
the
festivities
may
be
major
events
for
the
community
Usually
only
women
are
allowed
to
be
present
Sometimes
trained
midwife
will
be
available
to
give
local
anaesthetic
In
some
cultures
girls
will
be
told
to
sit
beforehand
in
cold
water
to
numb
the
area
and
reduce
the
likelihood
of
bleeding
More
commonly
however
no
steps
are
taken
to
reduce
the
pain
The
girl
is
immobilized
held
usually
by
older
women
with
her
legs
open
When
infibulation
takes
place
stitches
may
be
used
to
hold
the
two
sides
of
the
labia
majora
together
and
the
legs
may
be
bound
together
for
up
to
40
days
Antiseptic
powder
may
be
applied
or
more
usually
pastes
containing
herbs
milk
eggs
ashes
or
dung
which
are
believed
to
facilitate
healing
The
girl
may
be
taken
to
specially
designated
place
to
recover
where
if
the
mutilation
has
been
carried
out
as
part
of
an
initiation
ceremony
traditional
teaching
is
imparted

"Mr

it

"We

To
protect

South

has
tariffs
of

percent
on

To
keep
markets
open
for
its
economy
the
world's
12th
largest
South
Korea
has
recently
made
concessions
on
food
imports
in
bilateral
talks
and
in
preliminary
negotiations
in
the
W.T.O
With
each
concession
life
gets
little
harder
for
the
farmers
"It
is
not
hard
to
guess
why
he
chose
to
terminate
his
life,"
said
La

Han
an
official
in
Seoul
at
the
the
Korean
Advanced
Farmers
Federation
group
Mr
Lee
headed
for
many
years
"Probably
the
main
motivation
was
despair."
It
was
"a
despair
deeply
imbedded
in
the
conditions
of
the
farmers
the
agriculture
industry
and
the
rural
communities."
From
his
wife's
grave
Mr
Lee's
view
would
have
included
his
modest
one-story
brick
house
and
his
experimental
40-acre
farm
In
the
1970's
it
was
an
effort
by
college
graduate
from
Seoul
much
commented
upon
to
demonstrate
how
farmers
could
survive
and
compete
despite
declining
prices
for
their
products
"Even
now
the
land
is
being
abandoned,"
An
Sung
Hyun
said
pointing
out
paddies
abandoned
across
the
valley
floor
"If
we
import
more
food
more
land
will
be
abandoned."
"Parents
who
are
farming
don't
want
their
children
to
do
farming,"
he
said
speaking
in
room
filled
with
farmers
"There
is
no
hope
They
cannot
get
any
benefits
from
farming."
"Frankly
speaking
am
really
really
proud
of
him,"
his
daughter
Goh

said
"Because
he
sacrificed
himself
not
for
himself
but
for
the
nation."

America's
relations
with
Pakistan
and
several

Asian
countries
have
been
rocked
by
the
discovery
of
the
vast
smuggling
network
run
by

Pakistani

scientist
Abdul

Khan
Unfortunately
one
American
ally
at
the
heart
of
the
scandal
Dubai
in

seems
to
be
escaping
punishment
despite
its
role
as
the

Why
ship
through
Dubai?
Because
it
may
be
the
easiest
place
in
the
world
to
mask
the
real
destination
of
cargo
Consider
how
the
Malaysian
government
is
making
the
case
for
the
innocence
of
its
manufacturing
company
"No
document
was
traced
that
proved"
the
company
"delivered
or
exported
the
said
components
to
Libya,"
according
to
the
country's
inspector
general
of
police
The
real
destination
he
said
"was
outside
the
knowledge"
of
the
producer
One
can
be
certain
that
if
the
Khan
ring's
European
suppliers
are
ever
tracked
down
they
will
offer
similar
explanation
Dubai

Its

brags
that
its

"enables

without

Cum
autem
quadam
die
Maria
Magdalena
praedicaret
praedictus
princeps
dixit
ei:
"Putas
posse
defendere
fidem
quam
praedicas!"
Cui
illa:
"Equidem
illam
defendere
praesto
sum
utpote
quotidianis
miraculis
et
praedicatione
magistri
mei
Petri
qui
Romae
praesidet
roboratam."
Cui
princeps
cum
coniuge
dixit:
"Ecce
dictis
tuis
per
omnia
obtemperare
parati
sumus
si
Deo
quem
praedicas
nobis
filium
impetrabis
"Propter
hoc"'
inquit
Magdalena
"non
remanebit."
Tunc
beata
Maria
pro
ipsis
Dominum
exoravit
ut
sibi
filium
concedere
dignaretur
Cuius
preces
Dominus
exaudivit
et
matrona
illa
concepit
Tunc
vir
eius
coepit
velle
proficisci
ad
Petrum
ut
probaret
si
ut
Magdalena
de
Christo
praedicaverat
sic
veritas
se
haberet
Cui
uxor
dixit:
"Quid
est
domine!
Putasne
sine
me
proficisci!
Absit
Te
enim
recedente
recedam;
te
veniente
veniam;
te
quiescente
quiescam."
Cui
vir
ait:'Non

"Proiciatur

Et

Et
ecce

Tunc
chlamyde

cum

circumquaque
operuit
et
postmodum

Cumque
ad

Petrus:

Memo
to
other
leftists
like
me:
read
Multitude
It's
irritating
in
its
generalities
and
sometimes
too
affectless
but
it
helps
It
helped
me
realize
that
can't
rely
on
old
concepts
like
US
imperialism
to
understand
what's
going
on
The
blame
for
attacks
on
US
targets
is
not
just
on
the
US
The
changes
in
the
global
world
order
are
not
just
super-imperialism
of
one
super-power
but
global
contestation
for
power
between
the
trans-national
empire
of
capital
and
what
Negri
and
Hardt
call
the
multitude
It
makes
sense
out
of
things
that
can
otherwise
be
addressed
only
through
righteous
but
ignorant
indignation
71
This
country
like
Rome
under
the
lesser
Caesars
may
send
out
soldiers
for
400
years
or
so
but
it
will
decline
into
third-rate
power
In
its
decline
it
will
look
like
the
England
of
the
20st
Century
holding
on
to
coalitions
of
the
willing
fighting
border
wars
continually
striking
out
with
money
and
technology
at
competitors
and
friends
bewildered
that
others
don't
like
us
and
disappointed
at
our
seeming
failure
to
keep
hope
alive
Our
overweening
pride
inflated
by
the
dollars
everyone
in
the
world
clamored
for
has
made
our
vision
too
dim
to
notice
that
we
also
like
Imperial
Romans
or
Brits
are
no
longer
the
vital
ingenious
frontierspeople
we
liked
to
imagine
ourselves

asked

all
he
could
to
prevent
the
wedding
before
Clara's
21st
birthday
when
she
would
be
legally
able
without
his
consent;
Robert
and

went
ahead

Ph.D
who
claims
this
organ
is
markedly
smaller

LeVay
supports
the
thesis
expressed
in
The

Be
Queen
that
there
are
no
"true"
transgenders
The
author
J
Michael
Bailey
faculty

at

Chicago
bases
his
assertion
on
Prof
Ray
Blanchard's
theory
of
autogynephilia
term
described
as
love
of
oneself
as
woman
It
suggests
that
there
are
only
two
types
of
male-to-female
transsexuals:
homosexual
transsexuals
and
autogynephiles
[The
views
of
Blanchard
Bailey
and
LeVay
have
been
taken
up
by
the
Christian
fundamentalist
right
to
further
their
eradication
of

Comparison
of
MDA
to
MDMA:
"The
differences
from
MDM(A)
are
striking:
MDA
is
more
hallucinogenic
with
noticeable
closed
eye
imagery
is
much
greater
aesthetic
enhancer
especially
of
people
and
of
music;
is
more
euphoric;
more
"drug-like"
heavier
and
more
obviously
body-involved
trip
Tactile
sensation
is
more
powerful
erotic
and
noticeable
on
MDA
Physical
effects
are
more
up-front:
gastric
upset
pupil
dilation
water
retention
limbic
arousal
On
the
whole
we
find
MDA
more
enjoyable
and
interesting
trip;
longer
lasting
and
more
sexual/sensual
Our
favorite
characteristic
is
that
one
retains
an
interesting
psychedelic
ideation
on
MDA
rather
then
the
feeling-oriented
but
rather
idealess
thinking
of
MDM(A)

During
the
gold

communist
by
the
British

Under
Professor
Malinowski
he
studied
Anthropology
at
the
famous
London
School
of
Economics
(LSE)
In
1938
his
book
Facing
Mount
Kenya
saw
the
light
of
day
It
was
about
Kikuyu
customs
During

II
Kenyatta
served
on

and
other
prominent

were
arrested
His
trial
at
Kapenguria
on
April
8
1953
for
managing
Mau
Mau
was
mockery
of
justice
(Contemporary
opinion
linked
him
with
the
Mau
Mau
but
later

claims
otherwise
From
Wikipedia.org
Aug
2004
He
was
sentenced
to
years
in

and
to
indefinite

thereafter
On
August
21
1961
nine
years
after
his
arrest
he
was
freed
from

1963
Mzee
Kenyatta
became
the
first
Prime
Minister
of
self-governing
Kenya
At
midnight
on
December

amid
world
leaders
and
multitudes
of
people
the

1964
Kenya
became
Republic
within
the
Commonwealth
with
Kenyatta
as
the
President
Mzee
Kenyatta
is
acclaimed
from
all
quarters
of
the
world
as
true
son
of
Africa
renowned
leader
of
vision
initiative
guidance
and
an
international
public
figure
of
the
highest
caliber
Kenya
under
the
"Baba
Wa
Taifa"
(Father
of
the
Nation)
had
enjoyed
political
stability
economic
progress
as
well
as
agricultural
industrial
and
educational
advances
From
1974
onwards
Mzee
declared
free
primary
education
up
to
primary
grade
4
At
this
stage
he
asked
white
settlers
not
to
leave
Kenya
and
supported
reconciliation
He
retained
the
role
of
prime
minister
after
independence
was
declared
on
December
12
1963
In
1964
he
became
president
of
the
country
Kenyatta's
policy
was
conciliatory
and
he
kept
many
colonial
civil
servants
in
their
old
jobs
He
had
to
ask
for
British
troops'
help
against
Somali
revolts
in
the
northeast
and
an
army
mutiny
in
Nairobi
(January
1964)
Some
British
troops
remained
in
the
country
On
November
10
1964
KADU's
representatives
joined
the
ranks
of
KANU
forming
single

Kenyatta
instituted
relatively
peaceful
land
reform
oversaw
Kenya's
joining
the
United
Nations
and
concluded
trade
agreements
with
Milton
Obote's
Ugandaand
Julius
Nyerere's
Tanzania
He
pursued
non-aligned
foreign
policy
Stability
attracted
foreign
investment
and
he
was
an
influential
figure
everywhere
in
Africa
However
his
authoritarian
policies
drew
criticism
and
caused
dissent

Facing
Mount
Kenya
is
central
document
of
the
highest
distinction
in
anthropological
literature
an
invaluable
key
to
the
structure
of
African
society
and
the
nature
of
the
African
mind
Facing
Mount
Kenya
is
not
only
formal
study
of
life
and
death
work
and
play
sex
and
the
family
in
one
of
the
greatest
tribes
of
contemporary
Africa
but
work
of
considerable
literary
merit
The
very
sight
and
sound
of
Kikuyu
tribal
life
presented
here
are
at
once
comprehensive
and
intimate
and
as
precise
as
they
are
compassionate
Jomo
Kenyatta
the
grandson
of
Kikuyu
medicine
man
was
among
the
foremost
leaders
of
African
nationalism
and
one
of
the
great
men
at
the
modern
world
In
the
1930's
he
studied
at
the
London
School
of
Economics
and
took
his
degree
in
anthropology
under
Bronislaw
Malinowski
one
result
of
which
is
this
now
famous
account
of
his
own
Kikuyu
tribe."

It
is
important
to
note
that
Malinowski
was
one
of
the
inventors
of
functionalist
anthropology
man
european
His
view
of
the
actions
of
non-european
peoples
was
by
force
of
his
status
as
guest
in
the
places
he
studied
laissez-faire
one
It
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
taught
Kenyatta
and
other
students
to
"understand"
the
function
of
clitoridectomy
in
Kikiyu
culture
but
discouraged
censorious
views
of
such
practices
(e.g
those
of
Scottish
missionaries
in
Kenya)
on
the
grounds
of
non-intervention
Much
debate
has
ensued
over
the
years
regarding
clitoridectomy
and
female
genital
cutting
As
in
this
excerpt
from
Kenyatta
the
debate
frequently
pits
live
African
women
against
tradition
and
yet
by
"defending
culture"
leaves
relatively
recent
historical
artifact
in
place
without
critique

Heisenberg's
discussions
moved
rather
freely
and
quickly
from
talk
about
experimental
inaccuracies
to
epistemological
or
ontological
issues
and
back
again
However
ontological
questions
seemed
to
be
of
somewhat
less
interest
to
him
For
example
there
is
passage
(Heisenberg
1927
p
197)
where
he
discusses
the
idea
that
behind
our
observational
data
there
might
still
exist
hidden
reality
in
which
quantum
systems
have
definite
values
for
position
and
momentum
unaffected
by
the
uncertainty
relations
He
emphatically
dismisses
this
conception
as
an
unfruitful
and
meaningless
speculation
because
as
he
says
the
aim
of
physics
is
only
to
describe
observable
data
Similarly
in
the
Chicago
Lectures
(Heisenberg
1930
p
11)
he
warns
against
the
fact
that
the
human
language
permits
the
utterance
of
statements
which
have
no
empirical
content
at
all
but
nevertheless
produce
picture
in
our
imagination
He
notes
"One
should
be
especially
careful
in
using
the
words
'reality'
'actually'
etc.
since
these
words
very
often
lead
to
statements
of
the
type
just
mentioned."
So
Heisenberg
also
endorsed
an
interpretation
of
his
relations
as
rejecting
reality
in
which
particles
have
simultaneous
definite
values
for
position
and
momentum
http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08c.htm
102
Bohr
denied
that
classical
concepts
could
be
used
to
attribute
properties
to
physical
world
in-itself
behind
the
phenomena
i.e
properties
different
from
those
being
observed
In
contrast
classical
physics
rests
on
an
idealization
he
said
in
the
sense
that
it
assumes
that
the
physical
world
has
these
properties
in-itself
i.e
as
inherent
properties
independent
of
their
actual
observation
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/
103
Bohm
suggests
that
the
whole
universe
can
be
thought
of
as
kind
of
giant
flowing
hologram
or
holomovement
in
which
total
order
is
contained
in
some
implicit
sense
in
each
region
of
space
and
time
The
explicate
order
is
projection
from
higher
dimensional
levels
of
reality
and
the
apparent
stability
and
solidity
of
the
objects
and
entities
composing
it
are
generated
and
sustained
by
ceaseless
process
of
enfoldment
and
unfoldment
for
subatomic
particles
are
constantly
dissolving
into
the
implicate
order
and
then
recrystallizing
The
quantum
potential
postulated
in
the
causal
interpretation
corresponds
to
the
implicate
order
But
Bohm
suggests
that
the
quantum
potential
is
itself
organized
and
guided
by
superquantum
potential
representing
second
implicate
order
or
superimplicate
order
Indeed
he
proposes
that
there
may
be
an
infinite
series
and
perhaps
hierarchies
of
implicate
(or
"generative")
orders
some
of
which
form
relatively
closed
loops
and
some
of
which
do
not
Higher
implicate
orders
organize
the
lower
ones
which
in
turn
influence
the
higher
Bohm
believes
that
life
and
consciousness
are
enfolded
deep
in
the
generative
order
and
are
therefore
present
in
varying
degrees
of
unfoldment
in
all
matter
including
supposedly
"inanimate"
matter
such
as
electrons
or
plasmas
He
suggests
that
there
is
"protointelligence"
in
matter
so
that
new
evolutionary
developments
do
not
emerge
in
random
fashion
but
creatively
as
relatively
integrated
wholes
from
implicate
levels
of
reality
The
mystical
connotations
of
Bohm's
ideas
are
underlined
by
his
remark
that
the
implicate
domain
"could
equally
well
be
called
Idealism
Spirit
Consciousness
The
separation
of
the
two
--
matter
and
spirit
--
is
an
abstraction
The
ground
is
always
one."

ALGARVE
andITS
People
For
much
of
the
world
the
Algarve
is
synonymous
with
Portugal
yet
the
Portuguese
will
tell
you
the
exact
opposite:
the
region
has
little
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
country
The
southern
stretch
of
coast
is
more
reminiscent
of
North
African
landscape
than
European
one
It
has
no
cosmopolitan
cities
like
Lisbon
and
Porto
which
are
farther
north
Most
of
Portugal
is
known
for
quaint
towns
medieval
castles
and
grand
palaces
The
Algarve
is
more
recognizable
for
impenetrable
blocks
of
tourist
apartments
hotels
and
meticulously
manicured
golf
courses
And
beaches
Think
Algarve
and
the
mind
pictures
long
glorious
stretches
of
golden
sands
secluded
coves
framed
by
odd
ochre-colored
rock
formations
and
deep
green
waters
With
about
160
km
(100
miles)
of
coastline
Portugalâs
southern
province
is
one
of
Europeâs
premier
beach
destinations
The
occasionally
chilly
ocean
is
the
Atlantic
but
the
Algarve
has
sultry
Mediterranean
feel
Its
consistent
climate
is
the
best
in
Portugal
and
one
of
the
kindest
in
the
world:
more
than
250
days
of
sunshine
yearÂ âÂ more
than
almost
any
other
international
resort
area
The
moderating
effect
of
the
Gulf
Stream
produces
fresh
springtime
breeze
throughout
winter
and
in
late
January
and
February
white
almond

In
summer
the
heat
is
intense
but
rarely
unbearable
and
regardless
beautiful

are
always
just

away
Magnificent

aboundÂ âÂ several
with

dramatically
clinging

cliffs
and

just
skirting
the
edge
of
the

horseback

big-game

are
immensely
popular
Sports
beaches
and
hospitable
weatherÂ âÂ not
to
mention
easily
organized
package
vacationsÂ âÂ are
surely
the
reasons
the
Algarve
receives
as
many
visitors
as
the
rest
of
Portugal
in
its
entirety
But
itâs
not
just
international
tourists
that
descend
on
the
Algarve;
many
Portuguese
from
Lisbon
and
elsewhere
in
the
north
have
holiday
homes
and
spend
their
summer
vacations
here
The
coast
is
neatly
divided
into
the
rugged
Barlavento
to
the
west
and
the
flat
beauty
of
Sotavento
to
the
east
West
is
where
youâll
find
the
famous
orange
cliffs
and
surreal
eroded
rock
stacks
Near
Cabo
de
SÃ£o
Vicente
and
Sagres
the
extreme
western
point
the
terrain
is
surprisingly
barren
and
the
facilities
decidedly
low-key
The
ocean
can
also
be
forbiddingly
cold
Tourist
resorts
clutter
the
entire
middle
of
the
coast
from
Lagos
to
Faro
with
spectrum
of
homes
away
from
homeÂ âÂ monster
high-rises
to
low-rider
villasÂ âÂ spilling
across
the
rolling
hills
and
lining
the
beaches
Resorts
like
PortimÃ£o
Albufeira
and
Vilamoura
would
appear
to
have
little
room
left
to
grow
yet
tourist
facilities
seem
to
mate
with
each
other
and
reproduce
overnight
Much
of
the
unstoppable
growth
is
crass
and
frighteningly
commercial
and
the
crowds
in
summer
unbearable
The
eastern
third
of
the
Algarve
is
more
sedate
marriage
of
coast
and
ocean
with
warm
waters
and
hot
sands
stretching
past
the
wetlands
of
Ria
Formosa
to
the
Spanish
border
The
Algarveâs
most
picturesque
town
Tavira
is
along
this
section
of
the
coast
Away
from
the
coast
the
terrain
slopes
through
pines
mimosa
eucalyptus
and
heather
to
an
altitude
of
nearly
915
(3,000
ft)
Vacationers
wishing
to
escape
the
maddening
beach
crowds
can
run
for
the
hills
especially
the
tantalizing
Serra
de
Monchique
The
regionâs
exotic
name
is
derived
from
the
Arabic,Al-Gharb
meaning
âcountry
of
the
west.â
The
westernmost
territory
of
Europe
was
highly
prized
by
North
African
Moors
who
occupied
it
from
the
eighth
to
the
13th
centuries
Their
half
millennium
here
left
indelible
traces
seen
today
in
whitewashed
houses
hilltop
castles
and
colorful
ceramic
tiles
Following
the
Reconquest
of
Iberia
by
Christians
the
Algarve
led
Portugal
to
glory
and
fortune
Prince
Henry
the
Navigator
established
his
legendary
Navigation
School
along
Portugalâs
southern
coast
(financing
expeditions
with
royalties
from
the
Algarve
fishing
industry)
and
intrepid
explorers
set
out
in
caravels
from
Lagos
and
Sagres
In
the
15th
and
16th
centuries
they
ushered
in
an
Age
of
Discovery
rounding
Africaâs
Cape
of
Good
Hope
and
eventually
reaching
India
and
the
Pacific
Others
found
their
way
to
the
Americas
and
Brazil
Opening
world
trade
routes
across
the
globe
they
established
Portugal
as
maritime
superpower
Spices
gold
and
diamonds
flowed
across
the
seas
to
Lisbon
Portugal
soon
lapsed
into
decline
though
tattered
by
wars
and
constitutional
crises
and
for
two
centuries
or
more
the
Algarve
remained
isolated
from
the
rest
of
Europe
Even
though
the
coast
received
many
illustrious
visitors
from
Roman
times
through
the
Middle
Ages
and
up
to
the
Edwardian
period
(when
travelers
came
to
luxuriate
in
Monchiqueâs
spa
waters)
the
Algarveâs
elite
vacation
status
is
relatively
recent
phenomenon
The
first
resort
on
the
coast
Praia
da
Rocha
was
only
âdiscoveredâ
in
the
1930s
and
the
real
build-up
didnât
kick
into
overdrive
until
the
beginning
of
the
1980s
Spainâs
Costa
del
Sol
developed
earlier
and
more
rapidly
(and
some
would
say
more
disastrously)
Yet
the
lessons
of
rampant
ill-advised
development
across
the
border
were
not
heeded
Only
recently
has
environmental
and
aesthetic
consciousness
at
least
mandated
that
newer
developments
be
limited
to
low-rises
YetÂ âÂ quite
remarkably
in
the
face
of
the
ongoing
tourism
onslaughtÂ âÂ parts
of
the
Algarve
retain
their
old-fashioned
charm
The
main
road
along
the
coast
EN-125
is
lined
with
ceramic
shops
and
stifled
with
summertime
traffic
but
the
agricultural
countryside
to
the
north
is
different
world
Flowering
orchards
and
gentle
grain
fields
replace
hotels
apartments
and
snack
bars
slow
rural
lifestyle
perseveres
against
the
rush
of
modern
life
For
centuries
fishing
has
been
the
Algarveâs
lifeblood
Small
fishing
villages
preserve
their
simple
and
unaffected
ways
seemingly
oblivious
to
the
tourist
hordes
Scrappy
crews
of
small
hand-painted
boats
troll
the
waters
just
offshore
and
trawlers
fish
deep
in
the
Atlantic
for
big
shoals
of
bacalhau
(cod)
so
beloved
by
the
Portuguese
visit
to
the
local
fish
market
is
revealing
window
into
Algarvian
life
Negotiations
are
serious
but
friendly
The
same
scenario
is
played
out
thousand
times
day
at
markets
all
across
the
region;
every
town
has
market
day
at
least
once
month
Farmers
bring
their
livestock
to
trade
and
artisans
and
itinerant
vendors
sell
their
wares
Not
large
area
the
Algarve
is
relatively
easy
to
get
around
whether
by
train
or
car
(an
effort
that
is
much
more
relaxing
outside
of
the
main
summer
season)
The
distances
between
mega-resorts
and
unspoiled
villages
are
surprisingly
small
Besides
beaches
the
Algarveâs
major
attractions
are
towns
that
lived
through
centuries
of
adventure
triumph
and
disaster
Faro
Tavira
and
Lagos
are
towns
with
strong
Moorish
influence
and
quiet
mountain
towns
like
Silves
Alte
and
Salir
are
reminders
of
the
days
before
golf
courses
and
hotel
chains
Despite
the
regionâs
ancient
roots
few
historic
monuments
survive
from
before
1755
when
the
Algarve
was
rocked
by
monumental
earthquake
that
took
thousands
of
lives
and
leveled
buildings
as
far
north
as
Lisbon
Still
youâll
find
vestiges
of
vibrant
past
including
evocative
castle
ruins
and
churches
with
extraordinary
displays
of
Portuguese
glazed
tiles
Even
the
humblest
village
has
classic
white
church
sleepy
plaza
shaded
by
vivid
purple
jacaranda
and
if
you
time
it
right
the
drama
of
the
local
market
The
Portuguese
are
famously
hospitable
if
reserved
And
they
remain
tolerant
and
helpful
even
though
they
know
that
their
lovely
coast
is
no
longer
just
theirs
FROM
THREAT
TO
THREAT
In
chapters
and
we
described
how
the
U.S
government
adjusted
its
existing
agencies
and
capacities
to
address
the
emerging
threat
from
Usama
Bin
Ladin
and
his
associates
After
the
August
1998
bombings
of
the
American
embassies
in
Kenya
and
Tanzania
President
Bill
Clinton
and
his
chief
aides
explored
ways
of
getting
Bin
Ladin
expelled
from
Afghanistan
or
possibly
capturing
or
even
killing
him
Although
disruption
efforts
around
the
world
had
achieved
some
successes
the
core
of
Bin
Ladin's
organization
remained
intact
President
Clinton
was
deeply
concerned
about
Bin
Ladin
He
and
his
national
security
advisor
Samuel
"Sandy"
Berger
ensured
they
had
special
daily
pipeline
of
reports
feeding
them
the
latest
updates
on
Bin
Ladin's
reported
location
In
public
President
Clinton
spoke
repeatedly
about
the
threat
of
terrorism
referring
to
terrorist
training
camps
but
saying
little
about
Bin
Ladin
and
nothing
about
al
Qaeda
He
explained
to
us
that
this
was
deliberate-intended
to
avoid
enhancing
Bin
Ladin's
stature
by
giving
him
unnecessary
publicity
His
speeches
focused
especially
on
the
danger
of
nonstate
actors
and
of
chemical
and
biological
weapons
As
the
millennium
approached
the
most
publicized
worries
were
not
about
terrorism
but
about
computer
breakdowns-the
Y2K
scare
Some
government
officials
were
concerned
that
terrorists
would
take
advantage
of
such
breakdowns
THE
MILLENNIUM
CRISIS
"Bodies
Will
Pile
Up
in
Sacks"
On
November
30
1999
Jordanian
intelligence
intercepted
telephone
call
between
Abu
Zubaydah
longtime
ally
of
Bin
Ladin
and
Khadr
Abu
Hoshar
Palestinian
extremist
Abu
Zubaydah
said
"The
time
for
training
is
over."
Suspecting
that
this
was
signal
for
Abu
Hoshar
to
commence
terrorist
operation
Jordanian
police
arrested
Abu
Hoshar
and
15
others
and
informed
Washington
One
of
the
16
Raed
Hijazi
had
been
born
in
California
to
Palestinian
parents;
after
spending
his
childhood
in
the
Middle
East
he
had
returned
to
northern
California
taken
refuge
in
extremist
Islamist
beliefs
and
then
made
his
way
to
Abu
Zubaydah's
Khaldan
camp
in
Afghanistan
where
he
learned
the
fundamentals
of
guerrilla
warfare
He
and
his
younger
brother
had
been
recruited
by
Abu
Hoshar
into
loosely
knit
plot
to
attack
Jewish
and
American
targets
in
Jordan
After
late
1996
when
Abu
Hoshar
was
arrested
and
jailed
Hijazi
moved
back
to
the
United
States
worked
as
cabdriver
in
Boston
and
sent
money
back
to
his
fellow
plotters
After
Abu
Hoshar's
release
Hijazi
shuttled
between
Boston
and
Jordan
gathering
money
and
supplies
With
Abu
Hoshar
he
recruited
inTurkey
and
Syria
as
well
as
Jordan;
with
Abu
Zubaydah's
assistance
Abu
Hoshar
sent
these
recruits
to
Afghanistan
for
training
In
late
1998
Hijazi
and
Abu
Hoshar
had
settled
on
plan
They
would
first
attack
four
targets:
the
SAS
Radisson
Hotel
in
downtown
Amman
the
border
crossings
from
Jordan
into
Israel
and
two
Christian
holy
sites
at
time
when
all
these
locations
were
likely
to
be
thronged
with
American
and
other
tourists
Next
they
would
target
local
airport
and
other
religious
and
cultural
sites
Hijazi
and
Abu
Hoshar
cased
the
intended
targets
and
sent
reports
to
Abu
Zubaydah
who
approved
their
plan
Finally
back
in
Amman
from
Boston
Hijazi
gradually
accumulated
bomb-making
materials
including
sulfuric
acid
and
5,200
pounds
of
nitric
acid
which
were
then
stored
in
an
enormous
subbasement
dug
by
the
plotters
over
period
of
two
months
underneath
rented
house
In
early
1999
Hijazi
and
Abu
Hoshar
contacted
Khalil
Deek
an
American
citizen
and
an
associate
of
Abu
Zubaydah
who
lived
in
Peshawar
Pakistan
and
who
with
Afghanistan-based
extremists
had
created
an
electronic
version
of
terrorist
manual
the
Encyclopedia
of
Jihad
They
obtained
CD-ROM
of
this
encyclopedia
from
Deek
In
June
with
help
from
Deek
Abu
Hoshar
arranged
with
Abu
Zubaydah
for
Hijazi
and
three
others
to
go
to
Afghanistan
for
added
training
in
handling
explosives
In
late
November
1999
Hijazi
reportedly
swore
before
Abu
Zubaydah
the
bayat
to
Bin
Ladin
committing
himself
to
do
anything
Bin
Ladin
ordered
He
then
departed
for
Jordan
and
was
at
waypoint
in
Syria
when
Abu
Zubaydah
sent
Abu
Hoshar
the
message
that
prompted
Jordanian
authorities
to
roll
up
the
whole
cell
After
the
arrests
of
Abu
Hoshar
and
15
others
the
Jordanians
tracked
Deek
to
Peshawar
persuaded
Pakistan
to
extradite
him
and
added
him
to
their
catch
Searches
in
Amman
found
the
rented
house
and
among
other
things
71
drums
of
acids
several
forged
Saudi
passports
detonators
and
Deek's
Encyclopedia
Six
of
the
accomplices
were
sentenced
to
death
In
custody
Hijazi's
younger
brother
said
that
the
group's
motto
had
been
"The
season
is
coming
and
bodies
will
pile
up
in
sacks."
Diplomacy
and
Disruption
On
December
4
as
news
came
in
about
the
discoveries
in
Jordan
National
Security
Council
(NSC)
Counterterrorism
Coordinator
Richard
Clarke
wrote
Berger
"If
George's
[Tenet's]
story
about
planned
series
of
UBL
attacks
at
the
Millennium
is
true
we
will
need
to
make
some
decisions
NOW."
He
told
us
he
held
several
conversations
with
President
Clinton
during
the
crisis
He
suggested
threatening
reprisals
against
the
Taliban
in
Afghanistan
in
the
event
of
any
attacks
on
U.S
interests
anywhere
by
Bin
Ladin
He
further
proposed
to
Berger
that
strike
be
made
during
the
last
week
of
1999
against
al
Qaeda
camps
in
Afghanistan-a
proposal
not
adopted
Warned
by
the
CIA
that
the
disrupted
Jordanian
plot
was
probably
part
of
larger
series
of
attacks
intended
for
the
millennium
some
possibly
involving
chemical
weapons
the
Principals
Committee
met
on
the
night
of
December
and
decided
to
task
Clarke's
Counterterrorism
Security
Group
(CSG)
to
develop
plans
to
deter
and
disrupt
al
Qaeda
plots
Michael
Sheehan
the
State
Department
member
of
the
CSG
communicated
warnings
to
the
Taliban
that
they
would
be
held
responsible
for
future
al
Qaeda
attacks."
Mike
was
not
diplomatic,"
Clarke
reported
to
Berger
With
virtually
no
evidence
of
Taliban
response
new
approach
was
made
to
Pakistan
13
General
Anthony
Zinni
the
commander
of
Central
Command
(CENTCOM)
was
designated
as
the
President's
special
envoy
and
sent
to
ask
General
Musharraf
to
"take
whatever
action
you
deem
necessary
to
resolve
the
Bin
Laden
problem
at
the
earliest
possible
time."
But
Zinni
came
back
emptyhanded
As
Ambassador
William
Milam
reported
from
Islamabad
Musharraf
was
"unwilling
to
take
the
political
heat
at
home."
The
CIA
worked
hard
with
foreign
security
services
to
detain
or
at
least
keep
an
eye
on
suspected
Bin
Ladin
associates
Tenet
spoke
to
20
of
his
foreign
counterparts
Disruption
and
arrest
operations
were
mounted
against
terrorists
in
eight
countries
In
mid-December
President
Clinton
signed
Memorandum
of
Notification
(MON)
giving
the
CIA
broader
authority
to
use
foreign
proxies
to
detain
Bin
Ladin
lieutenants
without
having
to
transfer
them
to
U.S
custody
The
authority
was
to
capture
not
kill
though
lethal
force
might
be
used
if
necessary.16Tenet
would
later
send
message
to
all
CIA
personnel
overseas
saying
"The
threat
could
not
be
more
real
Do
whatever
is
necessary
to
disrupt
UBL's
plans
The
American
people
are
counting
on
you
and
me
to
take
every
appropriate
step
to
protect
them
during
this
period."
The
State
Department
issued
worldwide
threat
advisory
to
its
posts
overseas
Then
on
December
14
an
Algerian
jihadist
was
caught
bringing
load
of
explosives
into
the
United
States
Ressam's
Arrest
Ahmed
Ressam
23
had
illegally
immigrated
to
Canada
in
1994
Using
falsified
passport
and
bogus
story
about
persecution
in
Algeria
Ressam
entered
Montreal
and
claimed
political
asylum
For
the
next
few
years
he
supported
himself
with
petty
crime
Recruited
by
an
alumnus
of
Abu
Zubaydah's
Khaldan
camp
Ressam
trained
in
Afghanistan
in
1998
learning
among
other
things
how
to
place
cyanide
near
the
air
intake
of
building
to
achieve
maximum
lethality
at
minimum
personal
risk
Having
joined
other
Algerians
in
planning
possible
attack
on
U.S
airport
or
consulate
Ressam
left
Afghanistan
in
early
1999
carrying
precursor
chemicals
for
explosives
disguised
in
toiletry
bottles
notebook
containing
bomb
assembly
instructions
and
$12,000
Back
in
Canada
he
went
about
procuring
weapons
chemicals
and
false
papers
In
early
summer
1999
having
learned
that
not
all
of
his
colleagues
could
get
the
travel
documents
to
enter
Canada
Ressam
decided
to
carry
out
the
plan
alone
By
the
end
of
the
summer
he
had
chosen
three
Los
Angeles-area
airports
as
potential
targets
ultimately
fixing
on
Los
Angeles
International
(LAX)
as
the
largest
and
easiest
to
operate
in
surreptitiously
He
bought
or
stole
chemicals
and
equipment
for
his
bomb
obtaining
advice
from
three
Algerian
friends
all
of
whom
were
wanted
by
authorities
in
France
for
their
roles
in
past
terrorist
attacks
there
Ressam
also
acquired
new
confederates
He
promised
to
help
New
York-based
partner
Abdelghani
Meskini
get
training
in
Afghanistan
if
Meskini
would
help
him
maneuver
in
the
United
States
In
December
1999
Ressam
began
his
final
preparations
He
called
an
Afghanistan-based
facilitator
to
inquire
into
whether
Bin
Ladin
wanted
to
take
credit
for
the
attack
but
he
did
not
get
reply
He
spent
week
in
Vancouver
preparing
the
explosive
components
with
close
friend
The
chemicals
were
so
caustic
that
the
men
kept
their
windows
open
despite
the
freezing
temperatures
outside
and
sucked
on
cough
drops
to
soothe
their
irritated
throats
While
in
Vancouver
Ressam
also
rented
Chrysler
sedan
for
his
travel
into
the
United
States
and
packed
the
explosives
in
the
trunk's
spare
tire
well
On
December
14
1999
Ressam
drove
his
rental
car
onto
the
ferry
from
Victoria
Canada
to
Port
Angeles
Washington
Ressam
planned
to
drive
to
Seattle
and
meet
Meskini
with
whom
he
would

Case
Study
in
Terrorist
Travel
Following
familiar
terrorist
pattern
Ressam
and
his
associates
used
fraudulent
passports
and
immigration
fraud
to
travel
In
Ressam's
case
this
involved
flying
from
France
to
Montreal
using
photo-substituted
French
passport
under
false
name
Under
questioning
Ressam
admitted
the
passport
was
fraudulent
and
claimed
political
asylum
He
was
released
pending
hearing
which
he
failed
to
attend
His
political
asylum
claim
was
denied
He
was
arrested
again
released
again
and
given
another
hearing
date
Again
he
did
not
show
He
was
arrested
four
times
for
thievery
usually
from
tourists
but
was
neither
jailed
nor
deported
He
also
supported
himself
by
selling
stolen
documents
to
friend
who
was
document
broker
for
Islamist
terrorists
Ressam
eventually
obtained
genuine
Canadian
passport
through
document
vendor
who
stole
blank
baptismal
certificate
from
Catholic
church
With
this
document
he
was
able
to
obtain
Canadian
passport
under
the
name
of
Benni
Antoine
Noris
This
enabled
him
to
travel
to
Pakistan
and
from
there
to
Afghanistan
for
his
training
and
then
return
to
Canada
Impressed
Abu
Zubaydah
asked
Ressam
to
get
more
genuine
Canadian
passports
and
to
send
them
to
him
for
other
terrorists
to
use
Another
conspirator
Abdelghani
Meskini
used
stolen
identity
to
travel
to
Seattle
on
December
11
1999
at
the
request
of
Mokhtar
Haouari
another
conspirator
Haouari
provided
fraudulent
passports
and
visas
to
assist
Ressam
and
Meskini's
planned
getaway
from
the
United
States
to
Algeria
Pakistan
and
Afghanistan
One
of
Meskini's
associates
Abdel
HakimTizegha
also
filed
claim
for
political
asylum
He
was
released
pending
hearing
which
was
adjourned
and
rescheduled
five
times
His
claim
was
finally
denied
two
years
after
his
initial
filing
His
attorney
appealed
the
decision
andTizegha
was
allowed
to
remain
in
the
country
pending
the
appeal
Nine
months
later
his
attorney
notified
the
court
that
he
could
not
locate
his
client
warrant
of
deportation
was
issued
LAX
They
planned
to
detonate
the
bomb
on
or
around
January
1
2000
At
the
Immigration
and
Naturalization
Service
(INS)
preinspection
station
in
Victoria
Ressam
presented
officials
with
his
genuine
but
fraudulently
obtained
Canadian
passport
from
which
he
had
torn
the
Afghanistan
entry
and
exit
stamps
The
INS
agent
on
duty
ran
the
passport
through
variety
of
databases
but
since
it
was
not
in
Ressam's
name
he
did
not
pick
up
the
pending
Canadian
arrest
warrants
After
cursory
examination
of
Ressam's
car
the
INS
agents
allowed
Ressam
to
board
the
ferry
Late
in
the
afternoon
of
December
14
Ressam
arrived
in
Port
Angeles
He
waited
for
all
the
other
cars
to
depart
the
ferry
assuming
(incorrectly)
that
the
last
car
off
would
draw
less
scrutiny
Customs
officers
assigned
to
the
port
noticing
Ressam's
nervousness
referred
him
to
secondary
inspection
When
asked
for
additional
identification
Ressam
handed
the
Customs
agent
Price
Costco
membership
card
in
the
same
false
name
as
his
passport
As
that
agent
began
an
initial
pat-down
Ressam
panicked
and
tried
to
run
away
Inspectors
examining
Ressam's
rental
car
found
the
explosives
concealed
in
the
spare
tire
well
but
at
first
they
assumed
the
white
powder
and
viscous
liquid
were
drug-related-until
an
inspector
pried
apart
and
identified
one
of
the
four
timing
devices
concealed
within
black
boxes
Ressam
was
placed
under
arrest
Investigators
guessed
his
target
was
in
Seattle
They
did
not
learn
about
the
Los
Angeles
airport
planning
until
they
reexamined
evidence
seized
in
Montreal
in
2000;
they
obtained
further
details
when
Ressam
began
cooperating
in
May
2001
Emergency
Cooperation
After
the
disruption
of
the
plot
in
Amman
it
had
not
escaped
notice
in
Washington
that
Hijazi
had
lived
in
California
and
driven
cab
in
Boston
and
that
Deek
was
naturalized
U.S
citizen
who
as
Berger
reminded
President
Clinton
had
been
in
touch
with
extremists
in
the
United
States
as
well
as
abroad
Before
Ressam's
arrest
Berger
saw
no
need
to
raise
public
alarm
at
home-
although
the
FBI
put
all
field
offices
on
alert
Now
following
Ressam's
arrest
the
FBI
asked
for
an
unprecedented
number
of
special
wiretaps
Both
Berger
andTenet
told
us
that
their
impression
was
that
more
Foreign
Intelligence
Surveillance
Act
(FISA)
wiretap
requests
were
processed
during
the
millennium
alert
than
ever
before
The
next
day
writing
about
Ressam's
arrest
and
links
to
cell
in
Montreal
Berger
informed
the
President
that
the
FBI
would
advise
police
in
the
United
States
to
step
up
activities
but
would
still
try
to
avoid
undue
public
alarm
by
stressing
that
the
government
had
no
specific
information
about
planned
attacks
At
December
22
meeting
of
the
Small
Group
of
principals
FBI
Director
Louis
Freeh
briefed
officials
from
the
NSC
staff
CIA
and
Justice
on
wiretaps
and
investigations
inside
the
United
States
including
Brooklyn
entity
tied
to
the
Ressam
arrest
seemingly
unreliable
foreign
report
of
possible
attacks
on
seven
U.S
cities
two
Algerians
detained
on
the
Canadian
border
and
searches
in
Montreal
related
to
jihadist
cell
The
Justice
Department
released
statement
on
the
alert
the
same
day
Clarke's
staff
warned
"Foreign
terrorist
sleeper
cells
are
present
in
the
US
and
attacks
in
the
US
are
likely."
Clarke
asked
Berger
to
try
to
make
sure
that
the
domestic
agencies
remained
alert."
Is
there
threat
to
civilian
aircraft?"he
wrote
Clarke
also
asked
the
principals
in
late
December
to
discuss
foreign
security
service
report
about
Bin
Ladin
plan
to
put
bombs
on
transatlantic
flights
The
CSG
met
daily
Berger
said
that
the
principals
met
constantly
Later
when
asked
what
made
her
decide
to
ask
Ressam
to
step
out
of
his
vehicle
Diana
Dean
Customs
inspector
who
referred
Ressam
to
secondary
inspection
testified
that
it
was
her
"training
and
experience."
It
appears
that
the
heightened
sense
of
alert
at
the
national
level
played
no
role
in
Ressam's
detention
There
was
mounting
sense
of
public
alarm
The
earlier
Jordanian
arrests
had
been
covered
in
the
press
and
Ressam's
arrest
was
featured
on
network
evening
news
broadcasts
throughout
the
Christmas
season
The
FBI
was
more
communicative
during
the
millennium
crisis
than
it
had
ever
been
The
senior
FBI
official
for
counterterrorism
Dale
Watson
was
regular
member
of
the
CSG
and
Clarke
had
good
relations
both
with
him
and
with
some
of
the
FBI
agents
handling
al
Qaeda-related
investigations
including
John
O'Neill
in
New
York
As
rule
however
neither
Watson
nor
these
agents
brought
much
information
to
the
group
The
FBI
simply
did
not
produce
the
kind
of
intelligence
reports
that
other
agencies
routinely
wrote
and
disseminated
As
law
enforcement
officers
Bureau
agents
tended
to
write
up
only
witness
interviews
Written
case
analysis
usually
occurred
only
in
memoranda
to
supervisors
requesting
authority
to
initiate
or
expand
an
investigation
But
during
the
millennium
alert
with
its
direct
links
into
the
United
States
from
Hijazi
Deek
and
Ressam
FBI
officials
were
briefing
in
person
about
ongoing
investigations
not
relying
on
the
dissemination
of
written
reports
Berger
told
us
that
it
was
hard
for
FBI
officials
to
hold
back
information
in
front
of
cabinet-rank
group
After
the
alert
according
to
Berger
and
members
of
the
NSC
staff
the
FBI
returned
to
its
normal
practice
of
withholding
written
reports
and
saying
little
about
investigations
or
witness
interviews
taking
the
position
that
any
information
related
to
pending
investigations
might
be
presented
to
grand
jury
and
hence
could
not
be
disclosed
under
thenprevailing
federal
law
The
terrorist
plots
that
were
broken
up
at
the
end
of
1999
display
the
variety
of
operations
that
might
be
attributed
however
indirectly
to
al
Qaeda
The
Jordanian
cell
was
loose
affiliate;
we
now
know
that
it
sought
approval
and
training
from
Afghanistan
and
at
least
one
key
member
swore
loyalty
to
Bin
Ladin
But
the
cell's
plans
and
preparations
were
autonomous
Ressam's
ties
to
al
Qaeda
were
even
looser
Though
he
had
been
recruited
trained
and
prepared
in
network
affiliated
with
the
organization
and
its
allies
Ressam's
own
plans
were
nonetheless
essentially
independent
Al
Qaeda
and
Bin
Ladin
himself
did
have
at
least
one
operation
of
their
very
own
in
mind
for
the
millennium
period
In
chapter
we
introduced
an
al
Qaeda
operative
named
Nashiri
Working
with
Bin
Ladin
he
was
developing
plan
to
attack
ship
near
Yemen
On
January
3
an
attempt
was
made
to
attack
U.S.warship
in
Aden
the
USS
The
Sullivans
The
attempt
failed
when
the
small
boat
overloaded
with
explosives
sank
The
operatives
salvaged
their
equipment
without
the
attempt
becoming
known
and
they
put
off
their
plans
for
another
day
Al
Qaeda's
"planes
operation"
was
also
coming
along
In
January
2000
the
United
States
caught
glimpse
of
its
preparations
Lost
Trail
in
Southeast
Asia
In
late
1999
the
National
Security
Agency
(NSA)
analyzed
communications
associated
with
suspected
terrorist
facility
in
the
Middle
East
indicating
that
several
members
of
"an
operational
cadre"
were
planning
to
travel
to
Kuala
Lumpur
in
early
January
2000
Initially
only
the
first
names
of
three
were
known-"Nawaf,""Salem,"and"Khalid."
NSA
analysts
surmised
correctly
that
Salem
was
Nawaf
's
younger
brother
Seeing
links
not
only
with
al
Qaeda
but
specifically
with
the
1998
embassy
bombings
CIA
desk
officer
guessed
that
"something
more
nefarious
[was]
afoot."
In
chapter
5
we
discussed
the
dispatch
of
two
operatives
to
the
United
States
for
their
part
in
the
planes
operation-Nawaf
al
Hazmi
and
Khalid
al
Mihdhar
Two
more
Khallad
and
Abu
Bara
went
to
Southeast
Asia
to
case
flights
for
the
part
of
the
operation
that
was
supposed
to
unfold
there
All
made
their
way
to
Southeast
Asia
from
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
except
for
Mihdhar
who
traveled
from
Yemen
Though
Nawaf
's
trail
was
temporarily
lost
the
CIA
soon
identified"Khalid"
as
Khalid
al
Mihdhar
He
was
located
leaving
Yemen
and
tracked
until
he
arrived
in
Kuala
Lumpur
on
January
5
2000.45
Other
Arabs
unidentified
at
the
time
were
watched
as
they
gathered
with
him
in
the
Malaysian
capital
On
January
8
the
surveillance
teams
reported
that
three
of
the
Arabs
had
suddenly
left
Kuala
Lumpur
on
short
flight
to
Bangkok
They
identified
one
as
Mihdhar
They
later
learned
that
one
of
his
companions
was
named
Alhazmi
although
it
was
not
yet
known
that
he
was
"Nawaf."
The
only
identifier
available
for
the
third
person
was
part
of
name-Salahsae
In
Bangkok
CIA
officers
received
the
information
too
late
to
track
the
three
men
as
they
came
in
and
the
travelers
disappeared
into
the
streets
of
Bangkok
The
Counterterrorist
Center
(CTC)
had
briefed
the
CIA
leadership
on
the
gathering
in
Kuala
Lumpur
and
the
information
had
been
passed
on
to
Berger
and
the
NSC
staff
and
to
Director
Freeh
and
others
at
the
FBI
(though
the
FBI
noted
that
the
CIA
had
the
lead
and
would
let
the
FBI
know
if
domestic
angle
arose)
The
head
of
the
Bin
Ladin
unit
kept
providing
updates
unaware
at
first
even
that
the
Arabs
had
left
Kuala
Lumpur
let
alone
that
their
trail
had
been
lost
in
Bangkok
When
this
bad
news
arrived
the
names
were
put
on
Thai
watchlist
so
that
Thai
authorities
could
inform
the
United
States
if
any
of
them
departed
from
Thailand
Several
weeks
later
CIA
officers
in
Kuala
Lumpur
prodded
colleagues
in
Bangkok
for
additional
information
regarding
the
three
travelers
In
early
March
2000
Bangkok
reported
that
Nawaf
al
Hazmi
now
identified
for
the
first
time
with
his
full
name
had
departed
on
January
15
on
United
Airlines
flight
to
Los
Angeles
As
for
Khalid
al
Mihdhar
there
was
no
report
of
his
departure
even
though
he
had
accompanied
Hazmi
on
the
United
flight
to
Los
Angeles
No
one
outside
of
the
Counterterrorist
Center
was
told
any
of
this
The
CIA
did
not
try
to
register
Mihdhar
or
Hazmi
with
the
State
Department's
TIPOFF
watchlist-either
in
January
when
word
arrived
of
Mihdhar's
visa
or
in
March
when
word
came
that
Hazmi
too
had
had
U.S
visa
and
ticket
to
Los
Angeles
None
of
this
information-about
Mihdhar's
U.S
visa
or
Hazmi's
travel
to
the
United
States-went
to
the
FBI
and
nothing
more
was
done
to
track
any
of
the
three
until
January
2001
when
the
investigation
of
another
bombing
that
of
the
USS
Cole
reignited
interest
in
Khallad
We
will
return
to
that
story
in
chapter
8
POST-CRISIS
REFLECTION:
AGENDA
FOR
2000
After
the
millennium
alert
elements
of
the
U.S
government
reviewed
their
performance
The
CIA's
leadership
was
told
that
while
number
of
plots
had
been
disrupted
the
millennium
might
be
only
the
"kick-off
for
period
of
extended
attacks
Clarke
wrote
Berger
on
January
11
2000
that
the
CIA
the
FBI
Justice
and
the
NSC
staff
had
come
to
two
main
conclusions
First
U.S
disruption
efforts
thus
far
had
"not
put
too
much
of
dent"
in
Bin
Ladin's
network
If
the
United
States
wanted
to
"roll
back"
the
threat
disruption
would
have
to
proceed
at
"a
markedly
different
tempo."
Second,"sleeper
cells"
and
"a
variety
of
terrorist
groups"
had
turned
up
at
home
As
one
of
Clarke's
staff
noted
only
"chance
discovery"
by
U.S
Customs
had
prevented
possible
attack
Berger
gave
his
approval
for
the
NSC
staff
to
commence
an
"afteraction
review,"
anticipating
new
budget
requests
He
also
asked
DCI
Tenet
to
review
the
CIA's
counterterrorism
strategy
and
come
up
with
plan
for"where
we
go
from
here."
The
NSC
staff
advised
Berger
that
the
United
States
had
only
been
"nibbling
at
the
edges"
of
Bin
Ladin's
network
and
that
more
terror
attacks
were
question
not
of
"if
"but
rather
of
"when"and
"where."59The
Principals
Committee
met
on
March
10
2000
to
review
possible
new
moves
The
principals
ended
up
agreeing
that
the
government
should
take
three
major
steps
First
more
money
should
go
to
the
CIA
to
accelerate
its
efforts
to
"seriously
attrit"
al
Qaeda
Second
there
should
be
crackdown
on
foreign
terrorist
organizations
in
the
United
States
Third
immigration
law
enforcement
should
be
strengthened
and
the
INS
should
tighten
controls
on
the
Canadian
border
(including
stepping
up
U.S.-Canada
cooperation)
The
principals
endorsed
the
proposed
programs;
some
like
expanding
the
number
of
Joint
Terrorism
Task
Forces
moved
forward
and
others
like
creating
centralized
translation
unit
for
domestic
intelligence
intercepts
in
Arabic
and
other
languages
did
not
Pressing
Pakistan
While
this
process
moved
along
diplomacy
continued
its
rounds
Direct
pressure
on
the
Taliban
had
proved
unsuccessful
As
one
NSC
staff
note
put
it
"Under
the
Taliban
Afghanistan
is
not
so
much
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
as
it
is
state
sponsored
by
terrorists."
In
early
2000
the
United
States
began
high-level
effort
to
persuade
Pakistan
to
use
its
influence
over
the
Taliban
In
January
2000
Assistant
Secretary
of
State
Karl
Inderfurth
and
the
State
Department's
counterterrorism
coordinator
Michael
Sheehan
met
with
General
Musharraf
in
Islamabad
dangling
before
him
the
possibility
of
presidential
visit
in
March
as
reward
for
Pakistani
cooperation
Such
visit
was
coveted
by
Musharraf
partly
as
sign
of
his
government's
legitimacy
He
told
the
two
envoys
that
he
would
meet
with
Mullah
Omar
and
press
him
on
Bin
Ladin
They
left
however
reporting
to
Washington
that
Pakistan
was
unlikely
in
fact
to
do
anything,"
given
what
it
sees
as
the
benefits
of
Taliban
control
of
Afghanistan."
President
Clinton
was
scheduled
to
travel
to
India
The
State
Department
felt
that
he
should
not
visit
India
without
also
visiting
Pakistan
The
Secret
Service
and
the
CIA
however
warned
in
the
strongest
terms
that
visiting
Pakistan
would
risk
the
President's
life
Counterterrorism
officials
also
argued
that
Pakistan
had
not
done
enough
to
merit
presidential
visit
But
President
Clinton
insisted
on
including
Pakistan
in
the
itinerary
for
his
trip
to
South
Asia
His
one-day
stopover
on
March
25
2000
was
the
first
time
U.S
president
had
been
there
since
1969
At
his
meeting

President
Clinton
concentrated
on
tensions
between
Pakistan
and
India
and
the
dangers
of
nuclear
proliferation
but
also
discussed
Bin
Ladin
President
Clinton
told
us
that
when
he
pulled

aside
for
brief
one-on-one
meeting
he
pleaded
with
the
general
for
help
regarding
Bin

went
to

him
in

of
better
relations
with
the
United
States
if
he'd
help
us
get
Bin
Ladin
and
deal
with
another
issue
or
two."
The
U.S
effort
continued
Early
in
May
President
Clinton
urged
Musharraf
to
carry
through
on
his
promise
to
visit
Afghanistan
and
press
Mullah
Omar
to
expel
Bin
Ladin
At
the
end
of
the
month
Under
Secretary
of
State
Thomas
Pickering
followed
up
with
trip
to
the
region
In
June
DCI
Tenet
traveled
to
Pakistan
with
the
same
general
message
By
September
the
United
States
was
becoming
openly
critical
of
Pakistan
for
supporting
Taliban
military
offensive
aimed
at
completing
the
conquest
of
Afghanistan
In
December
taking
step
proposed
by
the
State
Department
some
months
earlier
the
United
States
led
campaign
for
new
UN
sanctions
which
resulted
in
UN
Security
Council
Resolution
1333
again
calling
for
Bin
Ladin's
expulsion
and
forbidding
any
country
to
provide
the
Taliban
with
arms
or
military
assistance
This
too
had
little
if
any
effect
The
Taliban
did
not
expel
Bin
Ladin
Pakistani
arms
continued
to
flow
across
the
border
Secretary
of
State
Madeleine
Albright
told
us
"We
did
not
have
strong
hand
to
play
with
the
Pakistanis
Because
of
the
sanctions
required
by
U.S
law
we
had
few
carrots
to
offer."
Congress
had
blocked
most
economic
and
military
aid
to
Pakistan
because
of
that
country's
nuclear
arms
program
and
Musharraf
's
coup
Sheehan
was
critical
of
Musharraf
telling
us
that
the
Pakistani
leader
"blew
chance
to
remake
Pakistan."
Building
New
Capabilities:
The
CIA
The
after-action
review
had
treated
the
CIA
as
the
lead
agency
for
any
offensive
against
al
Qaeda
and
the
principals
at
their
March
10
meeting
had
endorsed
strengthening
the
CIA's
capability
for
that
role
To
the
CTC
that
meant
proceeding
with
"the
Plan,"
which
it
had
put
forward
half
year
earlier-hiring
and
training
more
case
officers
and
building
up
the
capabilities
of
foreign
security
services
that
provided
intelligence
via
liaison
On
occasion
as
in
Jordan
in
December
1999
these
liaison
services
took
direct
action
against
al
Qaeda
cells
In
the
CTC
and
higher
up
the
CIA's
managers
believed
that
they
desperately
needed
funds
just
to
continue
their
current
counterterrorism
effort
for
they
reckoned
that
the
millennium
alert
had
already
used
up
all
of
the
Center's
funds
for
the
current
fiscal
year;
the
Bin
Ladin
unit
had
spent
140
percent
of
its
allocation
Tenet
told
us
he
met
with
Berger
to
discuss
funding
for
counterterrorism
just
two
days
after
the
principals'
meeting
While
Clarke
strongly
favored
giving
the
CIA
more
money
for
counterterrorism
he
differed
sharply
with
the
CIA's
managers
about
where
it
should
come
from
They
insisted
that
the
CIA
had
been
shortchanged
ever
since
the
end
of
the
Cold
War
Their
ability
to
perform
any
mission
counterterrorism
included
they
argued
depended
on
preserving
what
they
had
restoring
what
they
had
lost
since
the
beginning
of
the
1990s
and
building
from
there-with
across-the-board
recruitment
and
training
of
new
case
officers
and
the
reopening
of
closed
stations
To
finance
the
counterterrorism
effort
Tenet
had
gone
to
congressional
leaders
after
the
1998
embassy
bombings
and
persuaded
them
to
give
the
CIA
special
supplemental
appropriation
Now
in
the
aftermath
of
the
millennium
alert
Tenet
wanted
boost
in
overall
funds
for
the
CIA
and
another
supplemental
appropriation
specifically
for
counterterrorism
To
Clarke
this
seemed
evidence
that
the
CIA's
leadership
did
not
give
sufficient
priority
to
the
battle
against
Bin
Ladin
and
al
Qaeda
He
told
us
that
James
Pavitt
the
head
of
the
CIA's
Directorate
of
Operations
"said
if
there's
going
to
be
money
spent
on
going
after
Bin
Ladin
it
should
be
given
to
him
My
view
was
that
he
had
had
lot
of
money
to
do
it
and
long
time
to
do
it
and
didn't
want
to
put
more
good
money
after
bad."
The
CIA
had
very
different
attitude:
Pavitt
told
us
that
while
the
CIA's
Bin
Ladin
unit
did"extraordinary
and
commendable
work,"
his
chief
of
station
in
London
"was
just
as
much
part
of
the
al
Qaeda
struggle
as
an
officer
sitting
in
[the
Bin
Ladin
unit]."
The
dispute
had
large
managerial
implications
for
Clarke
had
found
allies
in
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
(OMB)
They
had
supplied
him
with
the
figures
he
used
to
argue
that
CIA
spending
on
counterterrorism
from
its
baseline
budget
had
shown
almost
no
increase
Berger
met
twice
with
Tenet
in
April
to
try
to
resolve
the
dispute
The
Deputies
Committee
met
later
in
the
month
to
review
fiscal
year
2000
and
2001
budget
priorities
and
offsets
for
the
CIA
and
other
agencies
In
the
end
Tenet
obtained
modest
supplemental
appropriation
which
funded
counterterrorism
without
requiring
much
reprogramming
of
baseline
funds
But
the
CIA
still
believed
that
it
remained
underfunded
for
counterterrorism
Terrorist
Financing
The
second
major
point
on
which
the
principals
had
agreed
on
March
10
was
the
need
to
crack
down
on
terrorist
organizations
and
curtail
their
fund-raising
The
embassy
bombings
of
1998
had
focused
attention
on
al
Qaeda's
finances
One
result
had
been
the
creation
of
an
NSC-led
interagency
committee
on
terrorist
financing
On
its
recommendation
the
President
had
designated
Bin
Ladin
and
al
Qaeda
as
subject
to
sanctions
under
the
International
Emergency
Economic
Powers
Act
This
gave
theTreasury
Department's
Office
of
Foreign
Assets
Control
(OFAC)
the
ability
to
search
for
and
freeze
any
Bin
Ladin
or
al
Qaeda
assets
that
reached
the
U.S
financial
system
But
since
OFAC
had
little
information
to
go
on
few
funds
were
frozen
In
July
1999
the
President
applied
the
same
designation
to
the
Taliban
for
harboring
Bin
Ladin
Here
OFAC
had
more
success
It
blocked
more
than
$34
million
in
Taliban
assets
held
in
U.S
banks
Another
$215
million
in
gold
and
$2
million
in
demand
deposits
all
belonging
to
the
Afghan
central
bank
and
held
by
the
Federal
Reserve
Bank
of
New
York
were
also
frozen
After
October
1999
when
the
State
Department
formally
designated
al
Qaeda
"foreign
terrorist
organization,"
it
became
the
duty
of
U.S
banks
to
block
its
transactions
and
seize
its
funds
Neither
this
designation
nor
UN
sanctions
had
much
additional
practical
effect;
the
sanctions
were
easily
circumvented
and
there
were
no
multilateral
mechanisms
to
ensure
that
other
countries'
financial
systems
were
not
used
as
conduits
for
terrorist
funding
Attacking
the
funds
of
an
institution
even
the
Taliban
was
easier
than
finding
and
seizing
the
funds
of
clandestine
worldwide
organization
like
al
Qaeda
Although
the
CIA's
Bin
Ladin
unit
had
originally
been
inspired
by
the
idea
of
studying
terrorist
financial
links
few
personnel
assigned
to
it
had
any
experience
in
financial
investigations
Any
terrorist-financing
intelligence
appeared
to
have
been
collected
collaterally
as
consequence
of
gathering
other
intelligence
This
attitude
may
have
stemmed
in
large
part
from
the
chief
of
this
unit
who
did
not
believe
that
simply
following
the
money
from
point
to
point
revealed
much
about
the
terrorists'
plans
and
intentions
As
result
the
CIA
placed
little
emphasis
on
terrorist
financing
Nevertheless
the
CIA
obtained
general
understanding
of
how
al
Qaeda
raised
money
It
knew
relatively
early
for
example
about
the
loose
affiliation
of
financial
institutions
businesses
and
wealthy
individuals
who
supported
extremist
Islamic
activities
Much
of
the
early
reporting
on
al
Qaeda's
financial
situation
and
its
structure
came
from
Jamal
Ahmed
al
Fadl
whom
we
have
mentioned
earlier
in
the
report
After
the
1998
embassy
bombings
the
U.S
government
tried
to
develop
clearer
picture
of
Bin
Ladin's
finances
U.S
interagency
group
traveled
to
Saudi
Arabia
twice
in
1999
and
2000
to
get
information
from
the
Saudis
about
their
understanding
of
those
finances
The
group
eventually
concluded
that
the
oft-repeated
assertion
that
Bin
Ladin
was
funding
al
Qaeda
from
his
personal
fortune
was
in
fact
not
true
The
officials
developed
new
theory:
al
Qaeda
was
getting
its
money
elsewhere
and
the
United
States
needed
to
focus
on
other
sources
of
funding
such
as
charities
wealthy
donors
and
financial
facilitators
Ultimately
although
the
intelligence
community
devoted
more
resources
to
the
issue
and
produced
somewhat
more
intelligence
it
remained
difficult
to
distinguish
al
Qaeda's
financial
transactions
among
the
vast
sums
moving
in
the
international
financial
system
The
CIA
was
not
able
to
find
or
disrupt
al
Qaeda's
money
flows
The
NSC
staff
thought
that
one
possible
solution
to
these
weaknesses
in
the
intelligence
community
was
to
create
an
all-source
terrorist-financing
intelligence
analysis
center
Clarke
pushed
for
the
funding
of
such
center
at
Treasury
but
neither
Treasury
nor
the
CIA
was
willing
to
commit
the
resources
Within
the
United
States
various
FBI
field
offices
gathered
intelligence
on
organizations
suspected
of
raising
funds
for
al
Qaeda
or
other
terrorist
groups
By
9/11
FBI
agents
understood
that
there
were
extremist
organizations
operating
within
the
United
States
supporting
global
jihadist
movement
and
with
substantial
connections
to
al
Qaeda
The
FBI
operated
web
of
informants
conducted
electronic
surveillance
and
had
opened
significant
investigations
in
number
of
field
offices
including
New
York
Chicago
Detroit
San
Diego
and
Minneapolis
On
national
level
however
the
FBI
never
used
the
information
to
gain
systematic
or
strategic
understanding
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
al
Qaeda
fundraising
Treasury
regulators
as
well
as
U.S
financial
institutions
were
generally
focused
on
finding
and
deterring
or
disrupting
the
vast
flows
of
U.S
currency
generated
by
drug
trafficking
and
high-level
international
fraud
Large-scale
scandals
such
as
the
use
of
the
Bank
of
New
York
by
Russian
money
launderers
to
move
millions
of
dollars
out
of
Russia
captured
the
attention
of
the
Department
of
the
Treasury
and
of
Congress
Before
9/11
Treasury
did
not
consider
terrorist
financing
important
enough
to
mention
in
its
national
strategy
for
money
laundering
Border
Security
The
third
point
on
which
the
principals
had
agreed
on
March
10
was
the
need
for
attention
to
America's
porous
borders
and
the
weak
enforcement
of
immigration
laws
Drawing
on
ideas
from
government
officials
Clarke's
working
group
developed
menu
of
proposals
to
bolster
border
security
Some
reworked
or
reiterated
previous
presidential
directives
They
included
creating
an
interagency
center
to
target
illegal
entry
and
human
traffickers;
imposing
tighter
controls
on
student
visas;
taking
legal
action
to
prevent
terrorists
from
coming
into
the
United
States
and
to
remove
those
already
here
detaining
them
while
awaiting
removal
proceedings;
further
increasing
the
number
of
immigration
agents
to
FBI
JointTerrorism
Task
Forces
to
help
investigate
immigration
charges
against
individuals
suspected
of
terrorism;
activating
special
court
to
enable
the
use
of
classified
evidence
in
immigration-related
national
security
cases;
and
both
implementing
new
security
measures
for
U.S
passports
and
working
with
the
United
Nations
and
foreign
governments
to
raise
global
security
standards
for
travel
documents
Clarke's
working
group
compiled
new
proposals
as
well
such
as
undertaking
Joint
Perimeter
Defense
program
with
Canada
to
establish
cooperative
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
programs
leading
to
joint
operations
based
on
shared
visa
and
immigration
data
and
joint
border
patrols;
staffing
land
border
crossings
24/7
and
equipping
them
with
video
cameras
physical
barriers
and
means
to
detect
weapons
of
mass
destruction
(WMD);
and
addressing
the
problem
of
migrants-possibly
including
terrorists-
who
destroy
their
travel
documents
so
they
cannot
be
returned
to
their
countries
of
origin
These
proposals
were
praiseworthy
in
principle
In
practice
however
they
required
action
by
weak
chronically
underfunded
executive
agencies
and
powerful
congressional
committees
which
were
more
responsive
to
well-organized
interest
groups
than
to
executive
branch
interagency
committees
The
changes
sought
by
the
principals
in
March
2000
were
only
beginning
to
occur
before
9/11
"Afghan
Eyes"
In
early
March
2000
when
President
Clinton
received
an
update
on
U.S.covert
action
efforts
against
Bin
Ladin
he
wrote
in
the
memo's
margin
that
the
United
States
could
surely
do
better
Military
officers
in
the
Joint
Staff
told
us
that
they
shared
this
sense
of
frustration
Clarke
used
the
President's
comment
to
push
the
CSG
to
brainstorm
new
ideas
including
aid
to
the
Northern
Alliance
Back
in
December
1999
Northern
Alliance
leader
Ahmed
Shah
Massoud
had
offered
to
stage
rocket
attack
against
Bin
Ladin's
Derunta
training
complex
Officers
at
the
CIA
had
worried
that
giving
him
green
light
might
cross
the
line
into
violation
of
the
assassination
ban
Hence
Massoud
was
told
not
to
take
any
such
action
without
explicit
U.S
authorization
In
the
spring
of
2000
after
the
CIA
had
sent
out
officers
to
explore
possible
closer
relationships
with
both
the
Uzbeks
and
the
Northern
Alliance
discussions
took
place
in
Washington
between
U.S
officials
and
delegates
sent
by
Massoud
The
Americans
agreed
that
Massoud
should
get
some
modest
technical
help
so
he
could
work
on
U.S
priorities-collecting
intelligence
on
and
possibly
acting
against
al
Qaeda
But
Massoud
wanted
the
United
States
both
to
become
his
ally
in
trying
to
overthrow
theTaliban
and
to
recognize
that
they
were
fighting
common
enemies
Clarke
and
Cofer
Black
the
head
of
the
Counterterrorist
Center
wanted
to
take
this
next
step
Proposals
to
help
the
Northern
Alliance
had
been
debated
in
the
U.S
government
since
1999
and
as
we
mentioned
in
chapter
4
the
U.S
government
as
whole
had
been
wary
of
endorsing
them
largely
because
of
the
Northern
Alliance's
checkered
history
its
limited
base
of
popular
support
in
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan's
objections
CIA
officials
also
began
pressing
proposals
to
use
their
ties
with
the
Northern
Alliance
to
get
American
agents
on
the
ground
in
Afghanistan
for
an
extended
period
setting
up
their
own
base
for
covert
intelligence
collection
and
activity
in
the
Panjshir
Valley
and
lessening
reliance
on
foreign
proxies."
There's
no
substitute
for
face-to-face,"
one
officer
told
us
But
the
CIA's
institutional
capacity
for
such
direct
action
was
weak
especially
if
it
was
not
working
jointly
with
the
U.S
military
The
idea
was
turned
down
as
too
risky
In
the
meantime
the
CIA
continued
to
work
with
its
tribal
assets
in
southern
Afghanistan
In
early
August
the
tribals
reported
an
attempt
to
ambush
Bin
Ladin's
convoy
as
he
traveled
on
the
road
between
Kabul
and
Kandahar
city-
their
first
such
reported
interdiction
attempt
in
more
than
year
and
half
But
it
was
not
success
According
to
the
tribals'
own
account
when
they
approached
one
of
the
vehicles
they
quickly
determined
that
women
and
children
were
inside
and
called
off
the
ambush
Conveying
this
information
to
the
NSC
staff
the
CIA
noted
that
they
had
no
independent
corroboration
for
this
incident
but
that
the
tribals
had
acted
within
the
terms
of
the
CIA's
authorities
in
Afghanistan
In
2000
plans
continued
to
be
developed
for
potential
military
operations
in
Afghanistan
Navy
vessels
that
could
launch
missiles
into
Afghanistan
were
still
on
call
in
the
north
Arabian
Sea
In
the
summer
the
military
refined
its
list
of
strikes
and
Special
Operations
possibilities
to
set
of
13
options
within
the
Operation
Infinite
Resolve
plan
Yet
planning
efforts
continued
to
be
limited
by
the
same
operational
and
policy
concerns
encountered
in
1998
and
1999
Although
the
intelligence
community
sometimes
knew
where
Bin
Ladin
was
it
had
been
unable
to
provide
intelligence
considered
sufficiently
reliable
to
launch
strike
Above
all
the
United
States
did
not
have
American
eyes
on
the
target
As
one
military
officer
put
it
we
had
our
hand
on
the
door
but
we
couldn't
open
the
door
and
walk
in
At
some
point
during
this
period
President
Clinton
expressed
his
frustration
with
the
lack
of
military
options
to
take
out
Bin
Ladin
and
the
al
Qaeda
leadership
remarking
to
General
Hugh
Shelton
"You
know
it
would
scare
the
shit
out
of
al-Qaeda
if
suddenly
bunch
of
black
ninjas
rappelled
out
of
helicopters
into
the
middle
of
their
camp."109
Although
Shelton
told
the
Commission
he
did
not
remember
the
statement
President
Clinton
recalled
this
remark
as
"one
of
the
many
things
said."
The
President
added
however
that
he
realized
nothing
would
be
accomplished
if
he
lashed
out
in
anger
Secretary
of
Defense
William
Cohen
thought
that
the
President
might
have
been
making
hypothetical
statement
Regardless
he
said
the
question
remained
how
to
get
the
"ninjas"
into
and
out
of
the
theater
of
operations
As
discussed
in
chapter
4
plans
of
this
kind
were
never
carried
out
before
9/11
In
late
1999
or
early
2000
the
Joint
Staff
's
director
of
operations
Vice
Admiral
Scott
Fry
directed
his
chief
information
operations
officer
Brigadier
General
Scott
Gration
to
develop
innovative
ways
to
get
better
intelligence
on
Bin
Ladin's
whereabouts
Gration
and
his
team
worked
on
number
of
different
ideas
aimed
at
getting
reliable
American
eyes
on
Bin
Ladin
in
way
that
would
reduce
the
lag
time
between
sighting
and
striking
One
option
was
to
use
small
unmanned
U.S
Air
Force
drone
called
the
Predator
which
could
survey
the
territory
below
and
send
back
video
footage
Another
option-eventually
dismissed
as
impractical-was
to
place
powerful
long-range
telescope
on
mountain
within
range
of
one
of
Bin
Ladin's
training
camps
Both
proposals
were
discussed
with
General
Shelton
the
chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
and
then
briefed
to
Clarke's
office
at
the
White
House
as
the
CSG
was
searching
for
new
ideas
In
the
spring
of
2000
Clarke
brought
in
the
CIA's
assistant
director
for
collection
Charles
Allen
to
work
together
with
Fry
on
joint
CIA-Pentagon
effort
that
Clarke
dubbed
"Afghan
Eyes."
After
much
argument
between
the
CIA
and
the
Defense
Department
about
who
should
pay
for
the
program
the
White
House
eventually
imposed
cost-sharing
agreement
The
CIA
agreed
to
pay
for
Predator
operations
as
60-day
"proof
of
concept"
trial
run
The
Small
Group
backed
Afghan
Eyes
at
the
end
of
June
2000
By
mid-July
testing
was
completed
and
the
equipment
was
ready
but
legal
issues
were
still
being
ironed
out
By
August
11
the
principals
had
agreed
to
deploy
the
Predator
The
NSC
staff
considered
how
to
use
the
information
the
drones
would
be
relaying
from
Afghanistan
Clarke's
deputy
Roger
Cressey
wrote
to
Berger
that
emergency
CSG
and
Principals
Committee
meetings
might
be
needed
to
act
on
video
coming
in
from
the
Predator
if
it
proved
able
to
lock
in
Bin
Ladin's
location
In
the
memo's
margin
Berger
wrote
that
before
considering
action
"I
will
want
more
than
verified
location:
we
will
need
at
least
data
on
pattern
of
movements
to
provide
some
assurance
he
will
remain
in
place."
President
Clinton
was
kept
up
to
date
On
September
7
the
Predator
flew
for
the
first
time
over
Afghanistan
When
Clarke
saw
video
taken
during
the
trial
flight
he
described
the
imagery
to
Berger
as
"truly
astonishing,"
and
he
argued
immediately
for
more
flights
seeking
to
find
Bin
Ladin
and
target
him
for
cruise
missile
or
air
attack
Even
if
Bin
Ladin
were
not
found
Clarke
said
Predator
missions
might
identify
additional
worthwhile
targets
such
as
other
al
Qaeda
leaders
or
stocks
of
chemical
or
biological
weapons
Clarke
was
not
alone
in
his
enthusiasm
He
had
backing
from
Cofer
Black
and
Charles
Allen
at
the
CIA
Ten
out
of
15
trial
missions
of
the
Predator
over
Afghanistan
were
rated
successful
On
the
first
flight
Predator
saw
security
detail
around
tall
man
in
white
robe
at
Bin
Ladin'sTarnak
Farms
compound
outside
Kandahar
After
second
sighting
of
the
"man
in
white"
at
the
compound
on
September
28
intelligence
community
analysts
determined
that
he
was
probably
Bin
Ladin
During
at
least
one
trial
mission
the
Taliban
spotted
the
Predator
and
scrambled
MiG
fighters
to
try
without
success
to
intercept
it
Berger
worried
that
Predator
might
be
shot
down
and
warned
Clarke
that
shootdown
would
be
"bonanza"
for
Bin
Ladin
and
the
Taliban
Still
Clarke
was
optimistic
about
Predator-as
well
as
progress
with
disruptions
of
al
Qaeda
cells
elsewhere
Berger
was
more
cautious
praising
the
NSC
staff
's
performance
but
observing
that
this
was
no
time
for
complacency
"Unfortunately,"
he
wrote
"the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
is
another
tunnel."
THE
ATTACK
ON
THE
USS
COLE
Early
in
chapter
we
introduced
along
with
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
two
other
men
who
became
operational
coordinators
for
al
Qaeda:
Khallad
and
Nashiri
As
we
explained
both
were
involved
during
1998
and
1999
in
preparing
to
attack
ship
off
the
coast
of
Yemen
with
boatload
of
explosives
They
had
originally
targeted
commercial
vessel
specifically
an
oil
tanker
but
Bin
Ladin
urged
them
to
look
for
U.S.warship
instead
In
January
2000
their
team
had
attempted
to
attack
warship
in
the
port
of
Aden
but
the
attempt
failed
when
the
suicide
boat
sank
More
than
nine
months
later
on
October
12,2000
al
Qaeda
operatives
in
small
boat
laden
with
explosives
attacked
U.S
Navy
destroyer
the
USS
Cole
The
blast
ripped
hole
in
the
side
of
the
Cole
killing
17
members
of
the
ship's
crew
and
wounding
at
least
40
The
plot
we
now
know
was
full-fledged
al
Qaeda
operation
supervised
directly
by
Bin
Ladin
He
chose
the
target
and
location
of
the
attack
selected
the
suicide
operatives
and
provided
the
money
needed
to
purchase
explosives
and
equipment
Nashiri
was
the
field
commander
and
managed
the
operation
in
Yemen
Khallad
helped
in
Yemen
until
he
was
arrested
in
case
of
mistaken
identity
and
freed
with
Bin
Ladin's
help
as
we
also
mentioned
earlier
Local
al
Qaeda
coordinators
included
Jamal
al
Badawi
and
Fahd
al
Quso
who
was
supposed
to
film
the
attack
from
nearby
apartment
The
two
suicide
operatives
chosen
were
Hassan
al
Khamri
and
Ibrahim
al
Thawar
also
known
as
Nibras
Nibras
and
Quso
delivered
money
to
Khallad
in
Bangkok
during
Khallad's
January
2000
trip
to
Kuala
Lumpur
and
Bangkok
In
September
2000
Bin
Ladin
reportedly
told
Nashiri
that
he
wanted
to
replace
Khamri
and
Nibras
Nashiri
was
angry
and
disagreed
telling
others
he
would
go
to
Afghanistan
and
explain
to
Bin
Ladin
that
the
new
operatives
were
already
trained
and
ready
to
conduct
the
attack
Prior
to
departing
Nashiri
gave
Nibras
and
Khamri
instructions
to
execute
the
attack
on
the
next
U.S.warship
that
entered
the
port
of
Aden
While
Nashiri
was
in
Afghanistan
Nibras
and
Khamri
saw
their
chance
They
piloted
the
explosives-laden
boat
alongside
the
USS
Cole
made
friendly
gestures
to
crew
members
and
detonated
the
bomb
Quso
did
not
arrive
at
the
apartment
in
time
to
film
the
attack
Back
in
Afghanistan
Bin
Ladin
anticipated
U.S
military
retaliation
He
ordered
the
evacuation
of
al
Qaeda's
Kandahar
airport
compound
and
fled-
first
to
the
desert
area
near
Kabul
then
to
Khowst
and
Jalalabad
and
eventually
back
to
Kandahar
In
Kandahar
he
rotated
between
five
to
six
residences
spending
one
night
at
each
residence
In
addition
he
sent
his
senior
advisor
Mohammed
Atef
to
different
part
of
Kandahar
and
his
deputy
Ayman
al
Zawahiri
to
Kabul
so
that
all
three
could
not
be
killed
in
one
attack
There
was
no
American
strike
In
February
2001
source
reported
that
an
individual
whom
he
identified
as
the
big
instructor
(probably
reference
to
Bin
Ladin)
complained
frequently
that
the
United
States
had
not
yet
attacked
According
to
the
source
Bin
Ladin
wanted
the
United
States
to
attack
and
if
it
did
not
he
would
launch
something
bigger
The
attack
on
the
USS
Cole
galvanized
al
Qaeda's
recruitment
efforts
Following
the
attack
Bin
Ladin
instructed
the
media
committee
then
headed
by
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
to
produce
propaganda
video
that
included
reenactment
of
the
attack
along
with
images
of
the
al
Qaeda
training
camps
and
training
methods;
it
also
highlighted
Muslim
suffering
in
Palestine
Kashmir
Indonesia
and
Chechnya
Al
Qaeda's
image
was
very
important
to
Bin
Ladin
and
the
video
was
widely
disseminated
Portions
were
aired
on
Al
Jazeera
CNN
and
other
television
outlets
It
was
also
disseminated
among
many
young
men
in
Saudi
Arabia
and
Yemen
and
caused
many
extremists
to
travel
to
Afghanistan
for
training
and
jihad
Al
Qaeda
members
considered
the
video
an
effective
tool
in
their
struggle
for
preeminence
among
other
Islamist
and
jihadist
movements
Investigating
the
Attack
Teams
from
the
FBI
the
Naval
Criminal
Investigative
Service
and
the
CIA
were
immediately
sent
to
Yemen
to
investigate
the
attack
With
difficulty
Barbara
Bodine
the
U.S
ambassador
to
Yemen
tried
to
persuade
the
Yemeni
government
to
accept
these
visitors
and
allow
them
to
carry
arms
though
the
Yemenis
balked
at
letting
Americans
openly
carry
long
guns
(rifles
shotguns
automatic
weapons)
Meanwhile
Bodine
and
the
leader
of
the
FBI
team
John
O'Neill
clashed
repeatedly-to
the
point
that
after
O'Neill
had
been
rotated
out
of
Yemen
but
wanted
to
return
Bodine
refused
the
request
Despite
the
initial
tension
the
Yemeni
and
American
investigations
proceeded
Within
few
weeks
the
outline
of
the
story
began
to
emerge
On
the
day
of
the
Cole
attack
list
of
suspects
was
assembled
that
included
al
Qaeda's
affiliate
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
U.S
counterterrorism
officials
told
us
they
immediately
assumed
that
al
Qaeda
was
responsible
But
as
Deputy
DCI
John
McLaughlin
explained
to
us
it
was
not
enough
for
the
attack
to
smell
look
and
taste
like
an
al
Qaeda
operation
To
make
case
the
CIA
needed
not
just
guess
but
link
to
someone
known
to
be
an
al
Qaeda
operative
Within
the
first
weeks
after
the
attack
the
Yemenis
found
and
arrested
both
Badawi
and
Quso
but
did
not
let
the
FBI
team
participate
in
the
interrogations
The
CIA
described
initial
Yemeni
support
after
the
Cole
as
"slow
and
inadequate."
President
Clinton
Secretary
Albright
and
DCI
Tenet
all
intervened
to
help
Because
the
information
was
secondhand
the
U.S
team
could
not
make
its
own
assessment
of
its
reliability
On
November
11
the
Yemenis
provided
the
FBI
with
new
information
from
the
interrogations
of
Badawi
and
Quso
including
descriptions
of
individuals
from
whom
the
detainees
had
received
operational
direction
One
of
them
was
Khallad
who
was
described
as
having
lost
his
leg
The
detainees
said
that
Khallad
helped
direct
the
Cole
operation
from
Afghanistan
or
Pakistan
The
Yemenis
(correctly)
judged
that
the
man
described
as
Khallad
was
Tawfiq
bin
Attash
An
FBI
special
agent
recognized
the
name
Khallad
and
connected
this
news
with
information
from
an
important
al
Qaeda
source
who
had
been
meeting
regularly
with
CIA
and
FBI
officers
The
source
had
called
Khallad
Bin
Ladin's
"run
boy,"
and
described
him
as
having
lost
one
leg
in
an
explosives
accident
at
training
camp
few
years
earlier
To
confirm
the
identification
the
FBI
agent
asked
the
Yemenis
for
their
photo
of
Khallad
The
Yemenis
provided
the
photo
on
November
22
reaffirming
their
view
that
Khallad
had
been
an
intermediary
between
the
plotters
and
Bin
Ladin
(In
meeting
with
U.S
officials
few
weeks
later
on
December
16
the
source
identified
Khallad
from
the
Yemeni
photograph.)
U.S
intelligence
agencies
had
already
connected
Khallad
to
al
Qaeda
terrorist
operations
including
the
1998
embassy
bombings
By
this
time
the
Yemenis
also
had
identified
Nashiri
whose
links
to
al
Qaeda
and
the
1998
embassy
bombings
were
even
more
well-known
In
other
words
the
Yemenis
provided
strong
evidence
connecting
the
Cole
attack
to
al
Qaeda
during
the
second
half
of
November
identifying
individual
operatives
whom
the
United
States
knew
were
part
of
al
Qaeda
During
December
the
United
States
was
able
to
corroborate
this
evidence
But
the
United
States
did
not
have
evidence
about
Bin
Ladin's
personal
involvement
in
the
attacks
until
Nashiri
and
Khallad
were
captured
in
2002
and
2003
Considering
Response
The
Cole
attack
prompted
renewed
consideration
of
what
could
be
done
about
al
Qaeda
According
to
Clarke
Berger
upbraided
DCITenet
so
sharply
after
the
Cole
attack-repeatedly
demanding
to
know
why
the
United
States
had
to
put
up
with
such
attacks-that
Tenet
walked
out
of
meeting
of
the
principals
The
CIA
got
some
additional
covert
action
authorities
adding
several
other
individuals
to
the
coverage
of
the
July
1999
Memorandum
of
Notification
that
allowed
the
United
States
to
develop
capture
operations
against
al
Qaeda
leaders
in
variety
of
places
and
circumstances
Tenet
developed
additional
options
such
as
strengthening
relationships
with
the
Northern
Alliance
and
the
Uzbeks
and
slowing
recent
al
Qaeda-related
activities
in
Lebanon
On
the
diplomatic
track
Berger
agreed
on
October
30
2000
to
let
the
State
Department
make
another
approach
toTaliban
Deputy
Foreign
Minister
Abdul
Jalil
about
expelling
Bin
Ladin
The
national
security
advisor
ordered
that
the
U.S.message"be
stern
and
foreboding."
This
warning
was
similar
to
those
issued
in
1998
and
1999
Meanwhile
the
administration
was
working
with
Russia
on
new
UN
sanctions
against
Mullah
Omar's
regime
President
Clinton
told
us
that
before
he
could
launch
further
attacks
on
al
Qaeda
in
Afghanistan
or
deliver
an
ultimatum
to
theTaliban
threatening
strikes
if
they
did
not
immediately
expel
Bin
Ladin
the
CIA
or
the
FBI
had
to
be
sure
enough
that
they
would
"be
willing
to
stand
up
in
public
and
say
we
believe
that
he
[Bin
Ladin]
did
this."
He
said
he
was
very
frustrated
that
he
could
not
get
definitive
enough
answer
to
do
something
about
the
Cole
attack
Similarly
Berger
recalled
that
to
go
to
war
president
needs
to
be
able
to
say
that
his
senior
intelligence
and
law
enforcement
officers
have
concluded
who
is
responsible
He
recalled
that
the
intelligence
agencies
had
strong
suspicions
but
had
reached
"no
conclusion
by
the
time
we
left
office
that
it
was
al
Qaeda."
Our
only
sources
for
what
intelligence
officials
thought
at
the
time
are
what
they
said
in
informal
briefings
Soon
after
the
Cole
attack
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
Clinton
administration
analysts
stopped
distributing
written
reports
about
who
was
responsible
The
topic
was
obviously
sensitive
and
both
Ambassador
Bodine
in
Yemen
and
CIA
analysts
in
Washington
presumed
that
the
government
did
not
want
reports
circulating
around
the
agencies
that
might
become
public
impeding
law
enforcement
actions
or
backing
the
President
into
corner
Instead
the
White
House
and
other
principals
relied
on
informal
updates
as
more
evidence
came
in
Though
Clarke
worried
that
the
CIA
might
be
equivocating
in
assigning
responsibility
to
al
Qaeda
he
wrote
Berger
on
November
that
the
analysts
had
described
their
case
by
saying
that
"it
has
web
feet
flies
and
quacks."
On
November
10
CIA
analysts
briefed
the
Small
Group
of
principals
on
their
preliminary
findings
that
the
attack
was
carried
out
by
cell
of
Yemeni
residents
with
some
ties
to
the
transnational
mujahideen
network
According
to
the
briefing
these
residents
likely
had
some
support
from
al
Qaeda
But
the
information
on
outside
sponsorship
support
and
direction
of
the
operation
was
inconclusive
The
next
day
Berger
and
Clarke
told
President
Clinton
that
while
the
investigation
was
continuing
it
was
becoming
increasingly
clear
that
al
Qaeda
had
planned
and
directed
the
bombing
In
mid-November
as
the
evidence
of
al
Qaeda
involvement
mounted
Berger
asked
General
Shelton
to
reevaluate
military
plans
to
act
quickly
against
Bin
Ladin
General
Shelton
tasked
General
Tommy
Franks
the
new
commander
of
CENTCOM
to
look
again
at
the
options
Shelton
wanted
to
demonstrate
that
the
military
was
imaginative
and
knowledgeable
enough
to
move
on
an
array
of
options
and
to
show
the
complexity
of
the
operations
He
briefed
Berger
on
the
"Infinite
Resolve"
strike
options
developed
since
1998
which
the
Joint
Staff
and
CENTCOM
had
refined
during
the
summer
into
list
of
13

CENTCOM
added
new
"phased
campaign"concept
for
wider-ranging
strikes
including
attacks
against
the
Taliban
For
the
first
time
these
strikes
envisioned
an
air
campaign
against
Afghanistan
of
indefinite
duration
Military
planners
did
not
include
contingency
planning
for
an
invasion
of
Afghanistan
The
concept
was
briefed
to
Deputy
National
Security
Advisor
Donald
Kerrick
on
December
20
and
to
other
officials
On
November
25
Berger
and
Clarke
wrote
President
Clinton
that
although
the
FBI
and
CIA
investigations
had
not
reached
formal
conclusion
they
believed
the
investigations
would
soon
conclude
that
the
attack
had
been
carried
out
by
large
cell
whose
senior
members
belonged
to
al
Qaeda
Most
of
those
involved
had
trained
in
Bin
Ladin-operated
camps
in
Afghanistan
Berger
continued
So
far
Bin
Ladin
had
not
been
tied
personally
to
the
attack
and
nobody
had
heard
him
directly
order
it
but
two
intelligence
reports
suggested
that
he
was
involved
When
discussing
possible
responses
though
Berger
referred
to
the
premise-al
Qaeda
responsibility-
as
an
"unproven
assumption."
In
the
same
November
25
memo
Berger
informed
President
Clinton
about
closely
held
idea:
last-chance
ultimatum
for
the
Taliban
Clarke
was
developing
the
idea
with
specific
demands:
immediate
extradition
of
Bin
Ladin
and
his
lieutenants
to
legitimate
government
for
trial
observable
closure
of
all
terrorist
facilities
in
Afghanistan
and
expulsion
of
all
terrorists
from
Afghanistan
within
90
days
Noncompliance
would
mean
U.S
"force
directed
at
the
Taliban
itself
and
U.S
efforts
to
ensure
that
the
Taliban
would
never
defeat
the
Northern
Alliance
No
such
ultimatum
was
issued
Nearly
month
later
on
December
21
the
CIA
made
another
presentation
to
the
Small
Group
of
principals
on
the
investigative
team's
findings
The
CIA's
briefing
slides
said
that
their
"preliminary
judgment"
was
that
Bin
Ladin's
al
Qaeda
group
"supported
the
attack"
on
the
Cole
based
on
strong
circumstantial
evidence
tying
key
perpetrators
of
the
attack
to
al
Qaeda
The
CIA
listed
the
key
suspects
including
Nashiri
In
addition
the
CIA
detailed
the
timeline
of
the
operation
from
the
mid-1999
preparations
to
the
failed
attack
on
the
USS
The
Sullivans
on
January
3
2000
through
meeting
held
by
the
operatives
the
day
before
the
attack
The
slides
said
that
so
far
the
CIA
had
"no
definitive
answer
on
[the]
crucial
question
of
outside
direction
of
the
attack-how
and
by
whom."
The
CIA
noted
that
the
Yemenis
claimed
that
Khallad
helped
direct
the
operation
from
Afghanistan
or
Pakistan
possibly
as
Bin
Ladin's
intermediary
but
that
it
had
not
seen
the
Yemeni
evidence
However
the
CIA
knew
from
both
human
sources
and
signals
intelligence
that
Khallad
was
tied
to
al
Qaeda
The
prepared
briefing
concluded
that
while
some
reporting
about
al
Qaeda's
role
might
have
merit
those
reports
offered
few
specifics
Intelligence
gave
some
ambiguous
indicators
of
al
Qaeda
direction
of
the
attack
This
President
Clinton
and
Berger
told
us
was
not
the
conclusion
they
needed
in
order
to
go
to
war
or
deliver
an
ultimatum
to
the
Taliban
threatening
war
The
election
and
change
of
power
was
not
the
issue
President
Clinton
added
There
was
enough
time
If
the
agencies
had
given
him
definitive
answer
he
said
he
would
have
sought
UN
Security
Council
ultimatum
and
given
the
Taliban
one
two
or
three
days
before
taking
further
action
against
both
al
Qaeda
and
the
Taliban
But
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
responsible
for
president
to
launch
an
invasion
of
another
country
just
based
on
"preliminary
judgment."
Other
advisers
have
echoed
this
concern
Some
of
Secretary
Albright's
advisers
warned
her
at
the
time
to
be
sure
the
evidence
conclusively
linked
Bin
Ladin
to
the
Cole
before
considering
any
response
especially
military
one
because
such
action
might
inflame
the
Islamic
world
and
increase
support
for
the
Taliban
Defense
Secretary
Cohen
told
us
it
would
not
have
been
prudent
to
risk
killing
civilians
based
only
on
an
assumption
that
al
Qaeda
was
responsible
General
Shelton
added
that
there
was
an
outstanding
question
as
to
who
was
responsible
and
what
the
targets
were
Clarke
recalled
that
while
the
Pentagon
and
the
State
Department
had
reservations
about
retaliation
the
issue
never
came
to
head
because
the
FBI
and
the
CIA
never
reached
firm
conclusion
He
thought
they
were
"holding
back."
He
said
he
did
not
know
why
but
his
impression
was
that
Tenet
and
Reno
possibly
thought
the
White
House
"didn't
really
want
to
know,"
since
the
principals'
discussions
by
November
suggested
that
there
was
not
much
White
House
interest
in
conducting
further
military
operations
against
Afghanistan
in
the
administration's
last
weeks
He
thought
that
instead
President
Clinton
Berger
and
Secretary
Albright
were
concentrating
on
lastminute
push
for
peace
agreement
between
the
Palestinians
and
the
Israelis
Some
of
Clarke's
fellow
counterterrorism
officials
such
as
the
State
Department's
Sheehan
and
the
FBI's
Watson
shared
his
disappointment
that
no
military
response
occurred
at
the
time
Clarke
recently
recalled
that
an
angry
Sheehan
asked
rhetorically
of
Defense
officials:"Does
al
Qaeda
have
to
attack
the
Pentagon
to
get
their
attention?"
On
the
question
of
evidence
Tenet
told
us
he
was
surprised
to
hear
that
the
White
House
was
awaiting
conclusion
from
him
on
responsibility
for
the
Cole
attack
before
taking
action
against
al
Qaeda
He
did
not
recall
Berger
or
anyone
else
telling
him
that
they
were
waiting
for
the
magic
words
from
the
CIA
and
the
FBI
Nor
did
he
remember
having
any
discussions
with
Berger
or
the
President
about
retaliation
Tenet
told
us
he
believed
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
present
the
case
Then
it
was
up
to
the
principals
to
decide
if
the
case
was
good
enough
to
justify
using
force
He
believed
he
laid
out
what
was
knowable
relatively
early
in
the
investigation
and
that
this
evidence
never
really
changed
until
after
9/11
CIA
official
told
us
that
the
CIA's
analysts
chose
the
term
"preliminary
judgment"
because
of
their
notion
of
how
an
intelligence
standard
of
proof
differed
from
legal
standard
Because
the
attack
was
the
subject
of
criminal
investigation
they
told
us
the
term
preliminary
was
used
to
avoid
locking
the
government
in
with
statements
that
might
later
be
obtained
by
defense
lawyers
in
future
court
case
At
the
time
Clarke
was
aware
of
the
problem
of
distinguishing
between
an
intelligence
case
and
law
enforcement
case
Asking
U.S
law
enforcement
officials
to
concur
with
an
intelligence-based
case
before
their
investigation
had
been
concluded
"could
give
rise
to
charges
that
the
administration
had
acted
before
final
culpability
had
been
determined."
There
was
no
interagency
consideration
of
just
what
military
action
might
have
looked
like
in
practice-either
the
Pentagon's
new
"phased
campaign"
concept
or
prolonged
air
campaign
in
Afghanistan
Defense
officials
such
as
Under
Secretary
Walter
Slocombe
and
Vice
Admiral
Fry
told
us
the
military
response
options
were
still
limited
Bin
Ladin
continued
to
be
elusive
They
felt
just
as
they
had
for
the
past
two
years
that
hitting
inexpensive
and
rudimentary
training
camps
with
costly
missiles
would
not
do
much
good
and
might
even
help
al
Qaeda
if
the
strikes
failed
to
kill
Bin
Ladin
In
late
2000
the
CIA
and
the
NSC
staff
began
thinking
about
the
counterterrorism
policy
agenda
they
would
present
to
the
new
administration
The
Counterterrorist
Center
put
down
its
best
ideas
for
the
future
assuming
it
was
free
of
any
prior
policy
or
financial
constraints
The
paper
was
therefore
infor
mally
referred
to
as
the
"Blue
Sky"
memo;
it
was
sent
to
Clarke
on
December
29
The
memo
proposed
major
effort
to
support
the
Northern
Alliance
through
intelligence
sharing
and
increased
funding
so
that
it
could
stave
off
the
Taliban
army
and
tie
down
al
Qaeda
fighters
This
effort
was
not
intended
to
remove
theTaliban
from
power
goal
that
was
judged
impractical
and
too
expensive
for
the
CIA
alone
to
attain
Increased
support
to
the
Uzbeks
to
strengthen
their
ability
to
fight
terrorism
and
assist
the
United
States
in
doing
so
Assistance
to
anti-Taliban
groups
and
proxies
who
might
be
encouraged
to
passively
resist
the
Taliban
The
CIA
memo
noted
that
there
was
"no
single
'silver
bullet'
available
to
deal
with
the
growing
problems
in
Afghanistan."
multifaceted
strategy
would
be
needed
to
produce
change
No
action
was
taken
on
these
ideas
in
the
few
remaining
weeks
of
the
Clinton
administration
Berger
did
not
recall
seeing
or
being
briefed
on
the
Blue
Sky
memo
Nor
was
the
memo
discussed
during
the
transition
with
incoming
top
Bush
administration
officials
Tenet
and
his
deputy
told
us
they
pressed
these
ideas
as
options
after
the
new
team
took
office
As
the
Clinton
administration
drew
to
close
Clarke
and
his
staff
developed
policy
paper
of
their
own
the
first
such
comprehensive
effort
since
the
Delenda
plan
of
1998
The
resulting
paper
entitled
"Strategy
for
Eliminating
the
Threat
from
the
Jihadist
Networks
of
al
Qida:
Status
and
Prospects,"
reviewed
the
threat
and
the
record
to
date
incorporated
the
CIA's
new
ideas
from
the
Blue
Sky
memo
and
posed
several
near-term
policy
options
Clarke
and
his
staff
proposed
goal
to
"roll
back"
al
Qaeda
over
period
of
three
to
five
years
Over
time
the
policy
should
try
to
weaken
and
eliminate
the
network's
infrastructure
in
order
to
reduce
it
to
"rump
group"
like
other
formerly
feared
but
now
largely
defunct
terrorist
organizations
of
the
1980s
"Continued
anti-al
Qida
operations
at
the
current
level
will
prevent
some
attacks,"
Clarke's
office
wrote,"but
will
not
seriously
attrit
their
ability
to
plan
and
conduct
attacks."
The
paper
backed

CHANGE
AND

On

2000
American
voters
went
to
the
polls
in
what
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
closest
presidential
contests
in
U.S
history-an
election
campaign
during
which
there
was
notable
absence
of
serious
discussion
of
the
al

threat
or
terrorism
Election
night
became

legal
fight
Until
the
Supreme
Court's
5-4
ruling
on
December
12
and
Vice

Al

concession
no
one
knew
whether
Gore
or
his
Republican
opponent
Texas
Governor
George
W
Bush
would
become
president
in
2001
The
dispute
over
the
election
and
the
36-day
delay
cut
in
half
the
normal
transition
period
Given
that
presidential
election
in
the
United

brings
wholesale

in
personnel
this
loss
of

hampered
the
new
administration
in
identifying

and
obtaining
Senate
confirmation
of
key
appointees
From
the
Old
to
the
New
The
principal
figures
on
Bush's
White
House
staff
would
be
National
Security
Advisor
Condoleezza
Rice
who
had
been
member
of
the
NSC
staff
in
the
administration
of
George
H.W
Bush;
Rice's
deputy
Stephen
Hadley
who
had
been
an
assistant
secretary
of
defense
under
the
first
Bush;
and
Chief
of
Staff
Andrew
Card
who
had
served
that
same
administration
as
deputy
chief
of

then
secretary
of

For
secretary

Bush
chose
General
Colin
Powell
who
had
been
national
security
advisor
for
President
Ronald
Reagan
and
then
chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
of

For
secretary

member
of
Congress
White

and
under
President
Gerald

already

Bush
decided
fairly
soon
to
keep
Tenet
as
Director
of
Central

Louis
Freeh
who
had
statutory
ten-year
tenure
would
remain
director
of
the
FBI
until
his
voluntary
retirement
in
the
summer
of

Bush
and
his
principal
advisers
had
all
received
briefings
on
terrorism
including
Bin
Ladin
In
early
September
2000
Acting
Deputy
Director
of
Central
Intelligence
John
McLaughlin
led
team
to
Bush's
ranch
in
Crawford
Texas
and
gave
him
wide-ranging
four-hour
review
of
sensitive
information
Ben
Bonk
deputy
chief
of
the
CIA's
Counterterrorist
Center
used
one
of
the
four
hours
to
deal
with
terrorism
To
highlight
the
danger
of
terrorists
obtaining

in

Bonk
told
Bush
that
Americans
would
die
from
terrorism
during
the
next
four
years
During
the
long
contest
after
election
day
the
CIA
set
up
an
office
in
Crawford
to
pass
intelligence
to
Bush
and
some
of
his
key
advisers
Tenet
accompanied
by
his
deputy
director
for
operations
James
Pavitt
briefed
President-elect
Bush
at
Blair
House
during
the
transition
President
Bush
told
us
he
askedTenet
whether
the
CIA
could
kill
Bin
Ladin
andTenet
replied
that
killing
Bin
Ladin
would
have
an
effect
but
would
not
end
the
threat
President
Bush
told
us
Tenet
said
to
him
that
the
CIA
had
all
the
authority
it
needed
In
December
Bush
met
with
Clinton
for
two-hour
one-on-one
discussion
of
national
security
and
foreign
policy
challenges
Clinton
recalled
saying
to
Bush
"I
think
you
will
find
that
by
far
your
biggest
threat
is
Bin
Ladin
and
the
al
Qaeda."
Clinton
told
us
that
he
also
said,"One
of
the
great
regrets
of
my
presidency
is
that
didn't
get
him
[Bin
Ladin]
for
you
because
tried
to."
Bush
told
the
Commission
that
he
felt
sure
President
Clinton
had
mentioned
terrorism
but
did
not
remember
much
being
said
about
al
Qaeda
Bush
recalled
that
Clinton
had
emphasized
other
issues
such
as
North
Korea
and
the
Israeli-
Palestinian
peace
process
In
early
January
Clarke
briefed
Rice
on
terrorism
He
gave
similar
presentations-describing
al
Qaeda
as
both
an
adaptable
global
network
of
jihadist
organizations
and
lethal
core
terrorist
organization-to
Vice
President-elect
Cheney
Hadley
and
Secretary
of
State-designate
Powell
One
line
in
the
briefing
slides
said
that
al
Qaeda
had
sleeper
cells
in
more
than
40
countries
including
the
United
States
Berger
told
us
that
he
made
point
of
dropping
in
on
Clarke's
briefing
of
Rice
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
issue
Later
the
same
day
Berger
met
with
Rice
He
says
that
he
told
her
the
Bush
administration
would
spend
more
time
on
terrorism
in
general
and
al
Qaeda
in
particular
than
on
anything
else
Rice's
recollection
was
that
Berger
told
her
she
would
be
surprised
at
how
much
more
time
she
was
going
to
spend
on
terrorism
than
she
expected
but
that
the
bulk
of
their
conversation
dealt
with
the
faltering
Middle
East
peace
process
and
North
Korea
Clarke
said
that
the
new
team
having
been
out
of
government
for
eight
years
had
steep
learning
curve
to
understand
al
Qaeda
and
the
new
transnational
terrorist
threat
Organizing
New
Administration
During
the
short
transition
Rice
and
Hadley
concentrated
on
staffing
and
organizing
the
NSC
Their
policy
priorities
differed
from
those
of
the
Clinton
administration
Those
priorities
included
China
missile
defense
the
collapse
of
the
Middle
East
peace
process
and
the
Persian
Gulf
Generally
aware
that
terrorism
had
changed
since
the
first
Bush
administration
they
paid
particular
attention
to
the
question
of
how
counterterrorism
policy
should
be
coordinated
Rice
had
asked
University
of
Virginia
history
professor
Philip
Zelikow
to
advise
her
on
the
transition
Hadley
and
Zelikow
asked
Clarke
and
his
deputy
Roger
Cressey
for
special
briefing
on
the
terrorist
threat
and
how
Clarke'sTransnationalThreats
Directorate
and
Counterterrorism
Security
Group
functioned
In
the
NSC
during
the
first
Bush
administration
many
tough
issues
were
addressed
at
the
level
of
the
Deputies

not
go
to
the

the

had
been
unable

them
Presidential

of
the
Clinton

at
Berger's
discretion
directly

who
sat
on
the
special
Small
Group
There
Clarke
himself
sat
as
de
facto
principal
Rice
decided
to
change
the
special
structure
that
had
been
built
to
coordinate
counterterrorism
policy
It
was
important
to
sound
policymaking
she
felt
that
Clarke's
interagency
committee-like
all
others-report
to
the
principals
through
the
deputies
Rice
made
an
initial
decision
to
hold
over
both
Clarke
and
his
entire
counterterrorism
staff
decision
that
she
called
rare
for
new
administration
She
decided
also
that
Clarke
should
retain
the
title
of
national
counterterrorism
coordinator
although
he
would
no
longer
be
de
facto
member
of
the
Principals
Committee
on
his
issues
The
decision
to
keep
Clarke
Rice
said
was
"not
uncontroversial,"
since
he
was
known
as
someone
who
"broke
china,"
but
she
and
Hadley
wanted
an
experienced
crisis
manager
No
one
else
from
Berger's
staff
had
Clarke's
detailed
knowledge
of
the
levers
of
government
168
Clarke
was
disappointed
at
what
he
perceived
as
demotion
He
also
worried
that
reporting
through
the
Deputies
Committee
would
slow
decisionmaking
on
counterterrorism
The
result
amid
all
the
changes
accompanying
the
transition
was
significant
continuity
in
counterterrorism
policy
Clarke
and
his
Counterterrorism
Security
Group
would
continue
to
manage
coordination
Tenet
remained
Director
of
Central
Intelligence
and
kept
the
same
chief
subordinates
including
Black
and
his
staff
at
the
Counterterrorist
Center
Shelton
remained
chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
with
the
Joint
Staff
largely
the
same
At
the
FBI
Director
Freeh
and
Assistant
Director
for
Counterterrorism
Dale
Watson
remained
Working-level
counterterrorism
officials
at
the
State
Department
and
the
Pentagon
stayed
on
as
is
typically
the
case
The
changes
were
at
the
cabinet
and
subcabinet
level
and
in
the
CSG's
reporting
arrangements
At
the
subcabinet
level
there
were
significant
delays
in
the
confirmation
of
key
officials
particularly
at
the
Defense
Department
The
procedures
of
the
Bush
administration
were
to
be
at
once
more
formal
and
less
formal
than
its
predecessor's
President
Clinton
voracious
reader
received
his
daily
intelligence
briefings
in
writing
He
often
scrawled
questions
and
comments
in
the
margins
eliciting
written
responses
The
new
president
by
contrast
reinstated
the
practice
of
face-to-face
briefings
from
the
DCI
President
Bush
and
Tenet
met
in
the
Oval
Office
at
8:00
A.M.
with
Vice
President
Cheney
Rice
and
Card
usually
also
present
The
President
and
the
DCI
both
told
us
that
these
daily
sessions
provided
useful
opportunity
for
exchanges
on
intelligence
issues
The
President
talked
with
Rice
every
day
and
she
in
turn
talked
by
phone
at
least
daily
with
Powell
and
Rumsfeld
As
result
the
President
often
felt
less
need
for
formal
meetings
If
however
he
decided
that
an
event
or
an
issue
called
for
action
Rice
would
typically
call
on
Hadley
to
have
the
Deputies
Committee
develop
and
review
options
The
President
said
that
this
process
often
tried
his
patience
but
that
he
understood
the
necessity
for
coordination
Early
Decisions
Within
the
first
few
days
after
Bush's
inauguration
Clarke
approached
Rice
in
an
effort
to
get
her-and
the
new
President-to
give
terrorism
very
high
priority
and
to
act
on
the
agenda
that
he
had
pushed
during
the
last
few
months
of
the
previous
administration
After
Rice
requested
that
all
senior
staff
identify
desirable
major
policy
reviews
or
initiatives
Clarke
submitted
an
elaborate
memorandum
on
January
25
2001
He
attached
to
it
his
1998
Delenda
Plan
and
the
December
2000
strategy
paper."
We
urgently
need
Principals
level
review
on
the
al
Qida
network,"
Clarke
wrote
He
wanted
the
Principals
Committee
to
decide
whether
al
Qaeda
was
"a
first
order
threat"
or
more
modest
worry
being
overblown
by
"chicken
little"
alarmists
Alluding
to
the
transition
briefing
that
he
had
prepared
for
Rice
Clarke
wrote
that
al
Qaeda
"is
not
some
narrow
little
terrorist
issue
that
needs
to
be
included
in
broader
regional
policy."
Two
key
decisions
that
had
been
deferred
he
noted
concerned
covert
aid
to
keep
the
Northern
Alliance
alive
when
fighting
began
again
in
Afghanistan
in
the
spring
and
covert
aid
to
the
Uzbeks
Clarke
also
suggested
that
decisions
should
be
made
soon
on
messages
to
theTaliban
and
Pakistan
over
the
al
Qaeda
sanctuary
in
Afghanistan
on
possible
new
money
for
CIA
operations
and
on
"when
and
how
to
respond
to
the
attack
on
the
USS
Cole."
The
national
security
advisor
did
not
respond
directly
to
Clarke's
memorandum
No
Principals
Committee
meeting
on
al
Qaeda
was
held
until
September
4
2001
(although
the
Principals
Committee
met
frequently
on
other
subjects
such
as
the
Middle
East
peace
process
Russia
and
the
Persian
Gulf
).174
But
Rice
and
Hadley
began
to
address
the
issues
Clarke
had
listed
What
to
do
or
say
about
the
Cole
had
been
an
obvious
question
since
inauguration
day
When
the
attack
occurred
25
days
before
the
election
candidate
Bush
had
said
to
CNN
"I
hope
that
we
can
gather
enough
intelligence
to
figure
out
who
did
the
act
and
take
the
necessary
action
There
must
be
consequence."
Since
the
Clinton
administration
had
not
responded
militarily
what
was
the
Bush
administration
to
do?
On
January
25
Tenet
briefed
the
President
on
the
Cole
investigation
The
written
briefing
repeated
for
top
officials
of
the
new
administration
what
the
CIA
had
told
the
Clinton
White
House
in
November
This
included
the
"preliminary
judgment"
that
al
Qaeda
was
responsible
with
the
caveat
that
no
evidence
had
yet
been
found
that
Bin
Ladin
himself
ordered
the
attack
Tenet
told
us
he
had
no
recollection
of
conversation
with
the
President
about
this
briefing
In
his
January
25
memo
Clarke
had
advised
Rice
that
the
government
should
respond
to
the
Cole
attack
but
"should
take
advantage
of
the
policy
that
'we
will
respond
at
time
place
and
manner
of
our
own
choosing'
and
not
be
forced
into
knee-jerk
responses."
Before
Vice
President
Cheney
visited
the
CIA
in
mid-February
Clarke
sent
him
memo-outside
the
usual
White
House
document-management
system-suggesting
that
he
ask
CIA
officials
"what
additional
information
is
needed
before
CIA
can
definitively
conclude
that
al-Qida
was
responsible"
for
the
Cole
In
March
2001
the
CIA's
briefing
slides
for
Rice
were
still
describing
the
CIA's
"preliminary
judgment"
that
"strong
circumstantial
case"
could
be
made
against
al
Qaeda
but
noting
that
the
CIA
continued
to
lack
"conclusive
information
on
external
command
and
control"
of
the
attack
Clarke
and
his
aides
continued
to
provide
Rice
and
Hadley
with
evidence
reinforcing
the
case
against
al
Qaeda
and
urging
action
The
President
explained
to
us
that
he
had
been
concerned
lest
an
ineffectual
air
strike
just
serve
to
give
Bin
Ladin
propaganda
advantage
He
said
he
had
not
been
told
about
Clinton
administration
warnings
to
the
Taliban
The
President
told
us
that
he
had
concluded
that
the
United
States
must
use
ground
forces
for
job
like
this
Rice
told
us
that
there
was
never
formal
recorded
decision
not
to
retaliate
specifically
for
the
Cole
attack
Exchanges
with
the
President
between
the
President
and
Tenet
and
between
herself
and
Powell
and
Rumsfeld
had
produced
consensus
that
"tit-for-tat"
responses
were
likely
to
be
counterproductive
This
had
been
the
case
she
thought
with
the
cruise
missile
strikes
of
August
1998
The
new
team
at
the
Pentagon
did
not
push
for
action
On
the
contrary
Rumsfeld
thought
that
too
much
time
had
passed
and
his
deputy
Paul
Wolfowitz
thought
that
the
Cole
attack
was
"stale."
Hadley
said
that
in
the
end
the
administration's
real
response
to
the
Cole
would
be
new
more
aggressive
strategy
against
al
Qaeda
The
administration
decided
to
propose
to
Congress
substantial
increase
in
counterterrorism
funding
for
national
security
agencies
including
the
CIA
and
the
FBI
This
included
27
percent
increase
in
counterterrorism
funding
for
the
CIA
Starting
Review
In
early
March
the
administration
postponed
action
on
proposals
for
increasing
aid
to
the
Northern
Alliance
and
the
Uzbeks
Rice
noted
at
the
time
that
more
wide-ranging
examination
of
policy
toward
Afghanistan
was
needed
first
She
wanted
the
review
very
soon
Rice
and
others
recalled
the
President
saying
"I'm
tired
of
swatting
at
flies."
The
President
reportedly
also
said,"I'm
tired
of
playing
defense
want
to
play
offense
want
to
take
the
fight
to
the
terrorists."
President
Bush
explained
to
us
that
he
had
become
impatient
He
apparently
had
heard
proposals
for
rolling
back
al
Qaeda
but
felt
that
catching
terrorists
one
by
one
or
even
cell
by
cell
was
not
an
approach
likely
to
succeed
in
the
long
run
At
the
same
time
he
said
he
understood
that
policy
had
to
be
developed
slowly
so
that
diplomacy
and
financial
and
military
measures
could
mesh
with
one
another
Hadley
convened
an
informal
Deputies
Committee
meeting
on
March
7
when
some
of
the
deputies
had
not
yet
been
confirmed
For
the
first
time
Clarke's
various
proposals-for
aid
to
the
Northern
Alliance
and
the
Uzbeks
and
for
Predator
missions-went
before
the
group
that
in
the
Bush
NSC
would
do
most
of
the
policy
work
Though
they
made
no
decisions
on
these
specific
proposals
Hadley
apparently
concluded
that
there
should
be
presidential
national
security
policy
directive
(NSPD)
on
terrorism
Clarke
would
later
express
irritation
about
the
deputies'
insistence
that
strategy
for
coping
with
al
Qaeda
be
framed
within
the
context
of
regional
policy
He
doubted
that
the
benefits
would
compensate
for
the
time
lost
The
administration
had
in
fact
proceeded
with
Principals
Committee
meetings
on
topics
including
Iraq
and
Sudan
without
prior
contextual
review
and
Clarke
favored
moving
ahead
similarly
with
narrow
counterterrorism
agenda
But
the
President's
senior
advisers
saw
the
al
Qaeda
problem
as
part
of
puzzle
that
could
not
be
assembled
without
filling
in
the
pieces
for
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
Rice
deferred
Principals
Committee
meeting
on
al
Qaeda
until
the
deputies
had
developed
new
policy
for
their
consideration
The
full
Deputies
Committee
discussed
al
Qaeda
on
April
30
CIA
briefing
slides
described
al
Qaeda
as
the
"most
dangerous
group
we
face,"
citing
its
"leadership
experience
resources
safe
haven
in
Afghanistan
[and]
focus
on
attacking
U.S."
The
slides
warned,"There
will
be
more
attacks."
At
the
meeting
the
deputies
endorsed
covert
aid
to
Uzbekistan
Regarding
the
Northern
Alliance
they
"agreed
to
make
no
major
commitment
at
this
time."
Washington
would
first
consider
options
for
aiding
other
anti-
Taliban
groups
Meanwhile
the
administration
would
"initiate
comprehensive
review
of
U.S
policy
on
Pakistan"
and
explore
policy
options
on
Afghanistan
"including
the
option
of
supporting
regime
change."
Working-level
officials
were
also
to
consider
new
steps
on
terrorist
financing
and
America's
perennially
troubled
public
diplomacy
efforts
in
the
Muslim
world
where
NSC
staff
warned
that
"we
have
by
and
large
ceded
the
court
of
public
opinion"
to
al
Qaeda
While
Clarke
remained
concerned
about
the
pace
of
the
policy
review
he
now
saw
greater
possibility
of
persuading
the
deputies
to
recognize
the
changed
nature
of
terrorism
The
process
of
fleshing
out
that
strategy
was
under
way
THE
NEW
ADMINISTRATION'S
APPROACH
The
Bush
administration
in
its
first
months
faced
many
problems
other
than
terrorism
They
included
the
collapse
of
the
Middle
East
peace
process
and
in
April
crisis
over
U.S."
spy
plane"
brought
down
in
Chinese
territory
The
new
administration
also
focused
heavily
on
Russia
new
nuclear
strategy
that
allowed
missile
defenses
Europe
Mexico
and
the
Persian
Gulf
In
the
spring
reporting
on
terrorism
surged
dramatically
In
chapter
8
we
will
explore
this
reporting
and
the
ways
agencies
responded
These
increasingly
alarming
reports
briefed
to
the
President
and
top
officials
became
part
of
the
context
in
which
the
new
administration
weighed
its
options
for
policy
on
al
Qaeda
Except
for
few
reports
that
the
CSG
considered
and
apparently
judged
to
be
unreliable
none
of
these
pointed
specifically
to
possible
al
Qaeda
action
inside
the
United
States-although
the
CSG
continued
to
be
concerned
about
the
domestic
threat
The
mosaic
of
threat
intelligence
came
from
the
Counterterrorist
Center
which
collected
only
abroad
Its
reports
were
not
supplemented
by
reports
from
the
FBI
Clarke
had
expressed
concern
about
an
al
Qaeda
presence
in
the
United
States
and
he
worried
about
an
attack
on
the
White
House
by
"Hizbollah
Hamas
al
Qida
and
other
terrorist
organizations."
In
May
President
Bush
announced
that
Vice
President
Cheney
would
himself
lead
an
effort
looking
at
preparations
for
managing
possible
attack
by
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
at
more
general
problems
of
national
preparedness
The
next
few
months
were
mainly
spent
organizing
the
effort
and
bringing
an
admiral
from
the
Sixth
Fleet
back
to
Washington
to
manage
it
The
Vice
President's
task
force
was
just
getting
under
way
when
the
9/11
attack
occurred
On
May
29
at
Tenet's
request
Rice
and
Tenet
converted
their
usual
weekly
meeting
into
broader
discussion
on
al
Qaeda;
participants
included
Clarke
CTC
chief
Cofer
Black
and
"Richard,"
group
chief
with
authority
over
the
Bin
Ladin
unit
Rice
asked
about
"taking
the
offensive"
and
whether
any
approach
could
be
made
to
influence
Bin
Ladin
or
the
Taliban
Clarke
and
Black
replied
that
the
CIA's
ongoing
disruption
activities
were
"taking
the
offensive"
and
that
Bin
Ladin
could
not
be
deterred
wide-ranging
discussion
then
ensued
about
"breaking
the
back"
of
Bin
Ladin's
organization
Tenet
emphasized
the
ambitious
plans
for
covert
action
that
the
CIA
had
developed
in
December
2000
In
discussing
the
draft
authorities
for
this
program
in
March
CIA
officials
had
pointed
out
that
the
spending
level
envisioned
for
these
plans
was
larger
than
the
CIA's
entire
current
budget
for
counterterrorism
covert
action
It
would
be
multiyear
program
requiring
such
levels
of
spending
for
about
five
years
The
CIA
official
"Richard,"
told
us
that
Rice
"got
it."
He
said
she
agreed
with
his
conclusions
about
what
needed
to
be
done
although
he
complained
to
us
that
the
policy
process
did
not
follow
through
quickly
enough
Clarke
and
Black
were
asked
to
develop
range
of
options
for
attacking
Bin
Ladin's
organization
from
the
least
to
most
ambitious
Rice
and
Hadley
asked
Clarke
and
his
staff
to
draw
up
the
new
presidential
directive
On
June
7
Hadley
circulated
the
first
draft
describing
it
as
"an
admittedly
ambitious"
program
for
confronting
al
Qaeda
The
draft
NSPD's
goal
was
to
"eliminate
the
al
Qida
network
of
terrorist
groups
as
threat
to
the
United
States
and
to
friendly
governments."
It
called
for
multiyear
effort
involving
diplomacy
covert
action
economic
measures
law
enforcement
public
diplomacy
and
if
necessary
military
efforts
The
State
Department
was
to
work
with
other
governments
to
end
all
al
Qaeda
sanctuaries
and
also
to
work
with
the
Treasury
Department
to
disrupt
terrorist
financing
The
CIA
was
to
develop
an
expanded
covert
action
program
including
significant
additional
funding
and
aid
to
anti-Taliban
groups
The
draft
also
tasked
OMB
with
ensuring
that
sufficient
funds
to
support
this
program
were
found
in
U.S
budgets
from
fiscal
years
2002
to
2006
Rice
viewed
this
draft
directive
as
the
embodiment
of
comprehensive
new
strategy
employing
all
instruments
of
national
power
to
eliminate
the
al
Qaeda
threat
Clarke
however
regarded
the
new
draft
as
essentially
similar
to
the
proposal
he
had
developed
in
December
2000
and
put
forward
to
the
new
administration
in
January
2001.202
In
May
or
June
Clarke
asked
to
be
moved
from
his
counterterrorism
portfolio
to
new
set
of
responsibilities
for
cybersecurity
He
told
us
that
he
was
frustrated
with
his
role
and
with
an
administration
that
he
considered
not
"serious
about
al
Qaeda."
If
Clarke
was
frustrated
he
never
expressed
it
to
her
Rice
told
us
Diplomacy
in
Blind
Alleys
Afghanistan
The
new
administration
had
already
begun
exploring
possible
diplomatic
options
retracing
many
of
the
paths
traveled
by
its
predecessors.U.S
envoys
again
pressed
the
Taliban
to
turn
Bin
Ladin
"over
to
country
where
he
could
face
justice"
and
repeated
yet
again
the
warning
that
the
Taliban
would
be
held
responsible
for
any
al
Qaeda
attacks
on
U.S
interests
The
Taliban's
representatives
repeated
their
old
arguments
Deputy
Secretary
of
State
Richard
Armitage
told
us
that
while
U.S
diplomats
were
becoming
more
active
on
Afghanistan
through
the
spring
and
summer
of
2001
"it
would
be
wrong
for
anyone
to
characterize
this
as
dramatic
shift
from
the
previous
administration."
In
deputies
meetings
at
the
end
of
June
Tenet
was
tasked
to
assess
the
prospects
forTaliban
cooperation
with
the
United
States
on
al
Qaeda
The
NSC
staff
was
tasked
to
flesh
out
options
for
dealing
with
the
Taliban
Revisiting
these
issues
tried
the
patience
of
some
of
the
officials
who
felt
they
had
already
been
down
these
roads
and
who
found
the
NSC's
procedures
slow."
We
weren't
going
fast
enough,"Armitage
told
us
Clarke
kept
arguing
that
moves
against
the
Taliban
and
al
Qaeda
should
not
have
to
wait
months
for
larger
review
of
U.S
policy
in
South
Asia."
For
the
government,"
Hadley
said
to
us,"we
moved
it
along
as
fast
as
we
could
move
it
along."
As
all
hope
in
moving
the
Taliban
faded
debate
revived
about
giving
covert
assistance
to
the
regime's
opponents
Clarke
and
the
CIA's
Cofer
Black
renewed
the
push
to
aid
the
Northern
Alliance
Clarke
suggested
starting
with
modest
aid
just
enough
to
keep
the
Northern
Alliance
in
the
fight
and
tie
down
al
Qaeda
terrorists
without
aiming
to
overthrow
the
Taliban
Rice
Hadley
and
the
NSC
staff
member
for
Afghanistan
Zalmay
Khalilzad
told
us
they
opposed
giving
aid
to
the
Northern
Alliance
alone
They
argued
that
the
program
needed
to
have
big
part
for
Pashtun
opponents
of
theTaliban
They
also
thought
the
program
should
be
conducted
on
larger
scale
than
had
been
suggested
Clarke
concurred
with
the
idea
of
larger
program
but
he
warned
that
delay
risked
the
Northern
Alliance's
final
defeat
at
the
hands
of
the
Taliban
During
the
spring
the
CIA
at
the
NSC's
request
had
developed
draft
legal
authorities-a
presidential
finding-to
undertake
large-scale
program
of
covert
assistance
to
the
Taliban's
foes
The
draft
authorities
expressly
stated
that
the
goal
of
the
assistance
was
not
to
overthrow
the
Taliban
But
even
this
program
would
be
very
costly
This
was
the
context
for
earlier
conversations
when
in
March
Tenet
stressed
the
need
to
consider
the
impact
of
such
large
program
on
the
political
situation
in
the
region
and
in
May
Tenet
talked
to
Rice
about
the
need
for
multiyear
financial
commitment
By
July
the
deputies
were
moving
toward
agreement
that
some
last
effort
should
be
made
to
convince
theTaliban
to
shift
position
and
then
if
that
failed
the
administration
would
move
on
the
significantly
enlarged
covert
action
program
As
the
draft
presidential
directive
was
circulated
in
July
the
State
Department
sent
the
deputies
lengthy
historical
review
of
U.S
efforts
to
engage
the
Taliban
about
Bin
Ladin
from
1996
on."
These
talks
have
been
fruitless,"
the
State
Department
concluded
Arguments
in
the
summer
brought
to
the
surface
the
more
fundamental
issue
of
whether
the
U.S
covert
action
program
should
seek
to
overthrow
the
regime
intervening
decisively
in
the
civil
war
in
order
to
change
Afghanistan's
government
By
the
end
of
deputies
meeting
on
September
10
officials
formally
agreed
on
three-phase
strategy
First
an
envoy
would
give
the
Taliban
last
chance
If
this
failed
continuing
diplomatic
pressure
would
be
combined
with
the
planned
covert
action
program
encouraging
anti-Taliban
Afghans
of
all
major
ethnic
groups
to
stalemate
the
Taliban
in
the
civil
war
and
attack
al
Qaeda
bases
while
the
United
States
developed
an
international
coalition
to
undermine
the
regime
In
phase
three
if
theTaliban's
policy
still
did
not
change
the
deputies
agreed
that
the
United
States
would
try
covert
action
to
topple
the
Taliban's
leadership
from
within
The
deputies
agreed
to
revise
the
al
Qaeda
presidential
directive
then
being
finalized
for
presidential
approval
in
order
to
add
this
strategy
to
it
Armitage
explained
to
us
that
after
months
of
continuing
the
previous
administration's
policy
he
and
Powell
were
bringing
the
State
Department
to
policy
of
overthrowing
the
Taliban
From
his
point
of
view
once
the
United
States
made
the
commitment
to
arm
the
Northern
Alliance
even
covertly
it
was
taking
action
to
initiate
regime
change
and
it
should
give
those
opponents
the
strength
to
achieve
complete
victory
Pakistan
The
Bush
administration
immediately
encountered
the
dilemmas
that
arose
from
the
varied
objectives
the
United
States
was
trying
to
accom
plish
in
its
relationship
with
Pakistan
In
February
2001
President
Bush
wrote
General
Musharraf
on
number
of
matters
He
emphasized
that
Bin
Ladin
and
al
Qaeda
were
"a
direct
threat
to
the
United
States
and
its
interests
that
must
be
addressed."
He
urged
Musharraf
to
use
his
influence
with
the
Taliban
on
Bin
Ladin
and
al
Qaeda
Powell
and
Armitage
reviewed
the
possibility
of
acquiring
more
carrots
to
dangle
in
front
of
Pakistan
Given
the
generally
negative
view
of
Pakistan
on
Capitol
Hill
the
idea
of
lifting
sanctions
may
have
seemed
far-fetched
but
perhaps
no
more
so
than
the
idea
of
persuading
Musharraf
to
antagonize
the
Islamists
in
his
own
government
and
nation
On
June
18
Rice
met
with
the
visiting
Pakistani
foreign
minister
Abdul
Sattar
She
"really
let
him
have
it"
about
al
Qaeda
she
told
us
Other
evidence
corroborates
her
account
But
as
she
was
upbraiding
Sattar
Rice
recalled
thinking
that
the
Pakistani
diplomat
seemed
to
have
heard
it
all
before
Sattar
urged
senior
U.S
policymakers
to
engage
the
Taliban
arguing
that
such
course
would
take
time
but
would
produce
results
In
late
June
the
deputies
agreed
to
review
U.S
objectives
Clarke
urged
Hadley
to
split
off
all
other
issues
in
U.S.-Pakistani
relations
and
just
focus
on
demanding
that
Pakistan
move
vigorously
against
terrorism-to
push
the
Pakistanis
to
do
before
an
al
Qaeda
attack
what
Washington
would
demand
that
they
do
after
He
had
made
similar
requests
in
the
Clinton
administration;
he
had
no
more
success
with
Rice
than
he
had
with
Berger
On
August
4
President
Bush
wrote
President
Musharraf
to
request
his
support
in
dealing
with
terrorism
and
to
urge
Pakistan
to
engage
actively
against
al
Qaeda
The
new
administration
was
again
registering
its
concerns
just
as
its
predecessor
had
but
it
was
still
searching
for
new
incentives
to
open
up
diplomatic
possibilities
For
its
part
Pakistan
had
done
little
Assistant
Secretary
of
State
Christina
Rocca
described
the
administration's
plan
to
break
this
logjam
as
move
from
"half
engagement"
to
"enhanced
engagement."
The
administration
was
not
ready
to
confront
Islamabad
and
threaten
to
rupture
relations
Deputy
Secretary
Armitage
told
us
that
before
9/11
the
envisioned
new
approach
to
Pakistan
had
not
yet
been
attempted
Saudi
Arabia
The
Bush
administration
did
not
develop
new
diplomatic
initiatives
on
al
Qaeda
with
the
Saudi
government
before
9/11
Vice
President
Cheney
called
Crown
Prince
Abdullah
on
July
5
2001
to
seek
Saudi
help
in
preventing
threatened
attacks
on
American
facilities
in
the
Kingdom
Secretary
of
State
Powell
met
with
the
crown
prince
twice
before
9/11
They
discussed
topics
like
Iraq
not
al
Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi
relations
in
the
summer
of
2001
were
marked
by
sometimes
heated
disagreements
about
ongoing
Israeli-
Palestinian
violence
not
about
Bin
Ladin
Military
Plans
The
confirmation
of
the
Pentagon's
new
leadership
was
lengthy
process
Deputy
Secretary
Wolfowitz
was
confirmed
in
March
2001
and
Under
Secretary
of
Defense
for
Policy
Douglas
Feith
in
July
Though
the
new
officials
were
briefed
about
terrorism
and
some
of
the
earlier
planning
including
that
for
Operation
Infinite
Resolve
they
were
focused
as
Secretary
Rumsfeld
told
us
on
creating
twenty-first-century
military
At
the
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
General
Shelton
did
not
recall
much
interest
by
the
new
administration
in
military
options
against
al
Qaeda
in
Afghanistan
He
could
not
recall
any
specific
guidance
on
the
topic
from
the
secretary
Brian
Sheridan-the
outgoing
assistant
secretary
of
defense
for
special
operations
and
low-intensity
conflict
(SOLIC)
the
key
counterterrorism
policy
office
in
the
Pentagon-never
briefed
Rumsfeld
He
departed
on
January
20;
he
had
not
been
replaced
by
9/11
Rumsfeld
noted
to
us
his
own
interest
in
terrorism
which
came
up
often
in
his
regular
meetings
with
Tenet
He
thought
that
the
Defense
Department
before
9/11
was
not
organized
adequately
or
prepared
to
deal
with
new
threats
like
terrorism
But
his
time
was
consumed
with
getting
new
officials
in
place
and
working
on
the
foundation
documents
of
new
defense
policy
the
quadrennial
defense
review
the
defense
planning
guidance
and
the
existing
contingency
plans
He
did
not
recall
any
particular
counterterrorism
issue
that
engaged
his
attention
before
9/11
other
than
the
development
of
the
Predator
unmanned
aircraft
system
The
commander
of
Central
Command
General
Franks
told
us
that
he
did
not
regard
the
existing
plans
as
serious
To
him
real
military
plan
to
address
al
Qaeda
would
need
to
go
all
the
way
following
through
the
details
of
full
campaign
(including
the
political-military
issues
of
where
operations
would
be
based)
and
securing
the
rights
to
fly
over
neighboring
countries
The
draft
presidential
directive
circulated
in
June
2001
began
its
discussion
of
the
military
by
reiterating
the
Defense
Department's
lead
role
in
protecting
its
forces
abroad
The
draft
included
section
directing
Secretary
Rumsfeld
to
"develop
contingency
plans"
to
attack
both
al
Qaeda
and
Taliban
targets
in
Afghanistan
The
new
section
did
not
specifically
order
planning
for
the
use
of
ground
troops
or
clarify
how
this
guidance
differed
from
the
existing
Infinite
Resolve
plans
Hadley
told
us
that
by
circulating
this
section
draft
Annex
to
the
directive
the
White
House
was
putting
the
Pentagon
on
notice
that
it
would
need
to
produce
new
military
plans
to
address
this
problem.225
"The
military
didn't
particularly
want
this
mission,"
Rice
told
us
With
this
directive
still
awaiting
President
Bush's
signature
Secretary
Rumsfeld
did
not
order
his
subordinates
to
begin
preparing
any
new
military
plans
against
either
al
Qaeda
or
the
Taliban
before
9/11
President
Bush
told
us
that
before
9/11
he
had
not
seen
good
options
for
special
military
operations
against
Bin
Ladin
Suitable
bases
in
neighboring
countries
were
not
available
and
even
if
the
U.S
forces
were
sent
in
it
was
not
clear
where
they
would
go
to
find
Bin
Ladin
President
Bush
told
us
that
before
9/11
there
was
an
appetite
in
the
government
for
killing
Bin
Ladin
not
for
war
Looking
back
in
2004
he
equated
the
presidential
directive
with
readiness
to
invade
Afghanistan
The
problem
he
said
would
have
been
how
to
do
that
if
there
had
not
been
another
attack
on
America
To
many
people
he
said
it
would
have
seemed
like
an
ultimate
act
of
unilateralism
But
he
said
that
he
was
prepared
to
take
that
on
Domestic
Change
and
Continuity
During
the
transition
Bush
had
chosen
John
Ashcroft
former
senator
from
Missouri
as
his
attorney
general
On
his
arrival
at
the
Justice
Department
Ashcroft
told
us
he
faced
number
of
problems
spotlighting
the
need
for
reform
at
the
FBI
In
February
Clarke
briefed
Attorney
General
Ashcroft
on
his
directorate's
issues
He
reported
that
at
the
time
the
attorney
general
acknowledged
"steep
learning
curve,"
and
asked
about
the
progress
of
the
Cole
investigation
Neither
Ashcroft
nor
his
predecessors
received
the
President's
Daily
Brief
His
office
did
receive
the
daily
intelligence
report
for
senior
officials
that
during
the
spring
and
summer
of
2001
was
carrying
much
of
the
same
threat
information
The
FBI
was
struggling
to
build
up
its
institutional
capabilities
to
do
more
against
terrorism
relying
on
strategy
called
MAXCAP
05
that
had
been
unveiled
in
the
summer
of
2000
The
FBI's
assistant
director
for
counterterrorism
Dale
Watson
told
us
that
he
felt
the
new
Justice
Department
leadership
was
not
supportive
of
the
strategy
Watson
had
the
sense
that
the
Justice
Department
wanted
the
FBI
to
get
back
to
the
investigative
basics:
guns
drugs
and
civil
rights
The
new
administration
did
seek
an
percent
increase
in
overall
FBI
funding
in
its
initial
budget
proposal
for
fiscal
year
2002
including
the
largest
proposed
percentage
increase
in
the
FBI's
counterterrorism
program
since
fiscal
year
1997
The
additional
funds
included
the
FBI's
support
of
the
2002
Winter
Olympics
in
Salt
Lake
City
Utah
(a
onetime
increase)
enhanced
security
at
FBI
facilities
and
improvements
to
the
FBI's
WMD
incident
response
capability
In
May
the
Justice
Department
began
shaping
plans
for
building
budget
for
fiscal
year
2003
the
process
that
would
usually
culminate
in
an
administration
proposal
at
the
beginning
of
2002
On
May
9
the
attorney
general
testified
at
congressional
hearing
concerning
federal
efforts
to
combat
terrorism
He
said
that
"one
of
the
nation's
most
fundamental
responsibilities
is
to
protect
its
citizens
from
terrorist
attacks."
The
budget
guidance
issued
the
next
day
however
highlighted
gun
crimes
narcotics
trafficking
and
civil
rights
as
priorities
Watson
told
us
that
he
almost
fell
out
of
his
chair
when
he
saw
this
memo
because
it
did
not
mention
counterterrorism
Longtime
FBI
Director
Louis
Freeh
left
in
June
2001
after
announcing
the
indictment
in
the
Khobar
Towers
case
that
he
had
worked
so
long
to
obtain
Thomas
Pickard
was
the
acting
director
during
the
summer
Freeh's
successor
Robert
Mueller
took
office
just
before
9/11
The
Justice
Department
prepared
draft
fiscal
year
2003
budget
that
maintained
but
did
not
increase
the
funding
level
for
counterterrorism
in
its
pending
fiscal
year
2002
proposal
Pickard
appealed
for
more
counterterrorism
enhancements
an
appeal
the
attorney
general
denied
on
September
10
Ashcroft
had
also
inherited
an
ongoing
debate
on
whether
and
how
to
modify
the
1995
procedures
governing
intelligence
sharing
between
the
FBI
and
the
Justice
Department's
Criminal
Division
But
in
August
2001
Ashcroft's
deputy
Larry
Thompson
issued
memorandum
reaffirming
the
1995
procedures
with
the
clarification
that
evidence
of
"any
federal
felony"
was
to
be
immediately
reported
by
the
FBI
to
the
Criminal
Division
The
1995
procedures
remained
in
effect
until
after
9/11
Covert
Action
and
the
Predator
In
March
2001
Rice
asked
the
CIA
to
prepare
new
series
of
authorities
for
covert
action
in
Afghanistan
Rice's
recollection
was
that
the
idea
had
come
from
Clarke
and
the
NSC
senior
director
for
intelligence
Mary
McCarthy
and
had
been
linked
to
the
proposal
for
aid
to
the
Northern
Alliance
and
the
Uzbeks
Rice
described
the
draft
document
as
providing
for
"consolidation
plus,"
superseding
the
various
Clinton
administration
documents
In
fact
the
CIA
drafted
two
documents
One
was
finding
that
did
concern
aid
to
opponents
of
the
Taliban
regime;
the
other
was
draft
Memorandum
of
Notification
which
included
more
open-ended
language
authorizing
possible
lethal
action
in
variety
of
situations
Tenet
delivered
both
to
Hadley
on
March
28
The
CIA's
notes
for
Tenet
advised
him
that
"in
response
to
the
NSC
request
for
drafts
that
will
help
the
policymakers
review
their
options
each
of
the
documents
has
been
crafted
to
provide
the
Agency
with
the
broadest
possible
discretion
permissible
under
the
law."
At
the
meeting
Tenet
argued
for
deciding
on
policy
before
deciding
on
the
legal
authorities
to
implement
it
Hadley
accepted
this
argument
and
the
draft
MON
was
put
on
hold
As
the
policy
review
moved
forward
the
planned
covert
action
program
for
Afghanistan
was
included
in
the
draft
presidential
directive
as
part
of
an
"Annex
A"
on
intelligence
activities
to
"eliminate
the
al
Qaeda
threat."
The
main
debate
during
the
summer
of
2001
concentrated
on
the
one
new
mechanism
for
lethal
attack
on
Bin
Ladin-an
armed
version
of
the
Predator
drone
In
the
first
months
of
the
new
administration
questions
concerning
the
Predator
became
more
and
more
central
focus
of
dispute
Clarke
favored
resuming
Predator
flights
over
Afghanistan
as
soon
as
weather
permitted
hoping
that
they
still
might
provide
the
elusive
"actionable
intelligence"
to
target
Bin
Ladin
with
cruise
missiles
Learning
that
the
Air
Force
was
thinking
of
equipping
Predators
with
warheads
Clarke
became
even
more
enthusiastic
about
redeployment
The
CTC
chief
Cofer
Black
argued
against
deploying
the
Predator
for
reconnaissance
purposes
He
recalled
that
theTaliban
had
spotted
Predator
in
the
fall
of
2000
and
scrambled
their
MiG
fighters
Black
wanted
to
wait
until
the
armed
version
was
ready
"I
do
not
believe
the
possible
recon
value
outweighs
the
risk
of
possible
program
termination
when
the
stakes
are
raised
by
the
Taliban
parading
charred
Predator
in
front
of
CNN,"
he
wrote
Military
officers
in
the
Joint
Staff
shared
this
concern
There
is
some
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
Deputies
Committee
endorsed
resuming
reconnaissance
flights
at
its
April
30
2001
meeting
In
any
event
Rice
and
Hadley
ultimately
went
along
with
the
CIA
and
the
Pentagon
holding
off
on
reconnaissance
flights
until
the
armed
Predator
was
ready
The
CIA's
senior
management
saw
problems
with
the
armed
Predator
as
well
problems
that
Clarke
and
even
Black
and
Allen
were
inclined
to
minimize
One
(which
also
applied
to
reconnaissance
flights)
was
money
Predator
cost
about
$3
million
If
the
CIA
flew
Predators
for
its
own
reconnaissance
or
covert
action
purposes
it
might
be
able
to
borrow
them
from
the
Air
Force
but
it
was
not
clear
that
the
Air
Force
would
bear
the
cost
if
vehicle
went
down
Deputy
Secretary
of
Defense
Wolfowitz
took
the
position
that
the
CIA
should
have
to
pay
for
it;
the
CIA
disagreed
Second
Tenet
in
particular
questioned
whether
he
as
Director
of
Central
Intelligence
should
operate
an
armed
Predator."
This
was
new
ground,"he
told
us
Tenet
ticked
off
key
questions:
What
is
the
chain
of
command?
Who
takes
the
shot?
Are
America's
leaders
comfortable
with
the
CIA
doing
this
going
outside
of
normal
military
command
and
control?
Charlie
Allen
told
us
that
when
these
questions
were
discussed
at
the
CIA
he
and
the
Agency's
executive
director
A
B."
Buzzy"
Krongard
had
said
that
either
one
of
them
would
be
happy
to
pull
the
trigger
but
Tenet
was
appalled
telling
them
that
they
had
no
authority
to
do
it
nor
did
he
Third
the
Hellfire
warhead
carried
by
the
Predator
needed
work
It
had
been
built
to
hit
tanks
not
people
It
needed
to
be
designed
to
explode
in
different
way
and
even
then
had
to
be
targeted
with
extreme
precision
In
the
configuration
planned
by
the
Air
Force
through
mid-2001
the
Predator's
missile
would
not
be
able
to
hit
moving
vehicle
White
House
officials
had
seen
the
Predator
video
of
the
"man
in
white."
On
July
11
Hadley
tried
to
hurry
along
preparation
of
the
armed
system
He
directed
McLaughlin
Wolfowitz
and
Joint
Chiefs
Vice
Chairman
Richard
Myers
to
deploy
Predators
capable
of
being
armed
no
later
than
September
1
He
also
directed
that
they
have
cost-sharing
arrangements
in
place
by
August
1
Rice
told
us
that
this
attempt
by
Hadley
to
dictate
solution
had
failed
and
that
she
eventually
had
to
intervene
herself
On
August
1
the
Deputies
Committee
met
again
to
discuss
the
armed
Predator
They
concluded
that
it
was
legal
for
the
CIA
to
kill
Bin
Ladin
or
one
of
his
deputies
with
the
Predator
Such
strikes
would
be
acts
of
self-defense
that
would
not
violate
the
ban
on
assassinations
in
Executive
Order
12333
The
big
issues-who
would
pay
for
what
who
would
authorize
strikes
and
who
would
pull
the
trigger-were
left
for
the
principals
to
settle
The
Defense
Department
representatives
did
not
take
positions
on
these
issues
The
CIA's
McLaughlin
had
also
been
reticent
When
Hadley
circulated
memorandum
attempting
to
prod
the
deputies
to
reach
agreement
McLaughlin
sent
it
back
with
handwritten
comment
on
the
cost-sharing:"we
question
whether
it
is
advisable
to
make
such
an
investment
before
the
decision
is
taken
on
flying
an
armed
Predator."
For
Clarke
this
came
close
to
being
final
straw
He
angrily
asked
Rice
to
callTenet."
Either
al
Qida
is
threat
worth
acting
against
or
it
is
not,"
Clarke
wrote."
CIA
leadership
has
to
decide
which
it
is
and
cease
these
bi-polar
mood
swings."
These
debates
though
had
little
impact
in
advancing
or
delaying
efforts
to
make
the
Predator
ready
for
combat
Those
were
in
the
hands
of
military
officers
and
engineers
General
John
Jumper
had
commanded
U.S
air
forces
in
Europe
and
seen
Predators
used
for
reconnaissance
in
the
Balkans
He
started
the
program
to
develop
an
armed
version
and
after
returning
in
2000
to
head
the
Air
Combat
Command
took
direct
charge
of
it
There
were
numerous
technical
problems
especially
with
the
Hellfire
missiles
The
Air
Force
tests
conducted
during
the
spring
were
inadequate
so
missile
testing
needed
to
continue
and
modifications
needed
to
be
made
during
the
summer
Even
then
Jumper
told
us
problems
with
the
equipment
persisted
Nevertheless
the
Air
Force
was
moving
at
an
extraordinary
pace."
In
the
modern
era
since
the
1980s,"
Jumper
said
to
us,"I
would
be
shocked
if
you
found
anything
that
went
faster
than
this."
September
2001
The
Principals
Committee
had
its
first
meeting
on
al
Qaeda
on
September
4
On
the
day
of
the
meeting
Clarke
sent
Rice
an
impassioned
personal
note
He
criticized
U.S
counterterrorism
efforts
past
and
present
The
"real
question"
before
the
principals
he
wrote
was
"are
we
serious
about
dealing
with
the
al
Qida
threat?
Is
al
Qida
big
deal?
Decision
makers
should
imagine
themselves
on
future
day
when
the
CSG
has
not
succeeded
in
stopping
al
Qida
attacks
and
hundreds
of
Americans
lay
dead
in
several
countries
including
the
US,"
Clarke
wrote
"What
would
those
decision
makers
wish
that
they
had
done
earlier?
That
future
day
could
happen
at
any
time."
Clarke
then
turned
to
the
Cole."
The
fact
that
the
USS
Cole
was
attacked
during
the
last
Administration
does
not
absolve
us
of
responding
for
the
attack,"
he
wrote
"Many
in
al
Qida
and
the
Taliban
may
have
drawn
the
wrong
lesson
from
the
Cole:
that
they
can
kill
Americans
without
there
being
US
response
without
there
being
price
One
might
have
thought
that
with
$250m
hole
in
destroyer
and
17
dead
sailors
the
Pentagon
might
have
wanted
to
respond
Instead
they
have
often
talked
about
the
fact
that
there
is
'nothing
worth
hitting
in
Afghanistan'
and
said
'the
cruise
missiles
cost
more
than
the
jungle
gyms
and
mud
huts'
at
terrorist
camps."
Clarke
could
not
understand
"why
we
continue
to
allow
the
existence
of
large
scale
al
Qida
bases
where
we
know
people
are
being
trained
to
kill
Americans."
Turning
to
the
CIA
Clarke
warned
that
its
bureaucracy
which
was
"masterful
at
passive
aggressive
behavior,"
would
resist
funding
the
new
national
security
presidential
directive
leaving
it
"hollow
shell
of
words
without
deeds."
The
CIA
would
insist
its
other
priorities
were
more
important
Invoking
President
Bush's
own
language
Clarke
wrote,"You
are
left
with
modest
effort
to
swat
flies
to
try
to
prevent
specific
al
Qida
attacks
by
using
[intelligence]
to
detect
them
and
friendly
governments'
police
and
intelligence
officers
to
stop
them
You
are
left
waiting
for
the
big
attack
with
lots
of
casualties
after
which
some
major
US
retaliation
will
be
in
order[.]"
Rice
told
us
she
took
Clarke's
memo
as
warning
not
to
get
dragged
down
by
bureaucratic
inertia
While
his
arguments
have
force
we
also
take
Clarke's
jeremiad
as
something
more
After
nine
years
on
the
NSC
staff
and
more
than
three
years
as
the
president's
national
coordinator
he
had
often
failed
to
persuade
these
agencies
to
adopt
his
views
or
to
persuade
his
superiors
to
set
an
agenda
of
the
sort
he
wanted
or
that
the
whole
government
could
support
Meanwhile
another
counterterrorism
veteran
Cofer
Black
was
preparing
his
boss
for
the
principals
meeting
He
advised
Tenet
that
the
draft
presidential
directive
envisioned
an
ambitious
covert
action
program
but
that
the
authorities
for
it
had
not
yet
been
approved
and
the
funding
still
had
not
been
found
If
the
CIA
was
reluctant
to
use
the
Predator
Black
did
not
mention
it
He
wanted
"a
timely
decision
from
the
Principals,"
adding
that
the
window
for
missions
within
2001
was
short
one
The
principals
would
have
to
decide
whether
Rice
Tenet
Rumsfeld
or
someone
else
would
give
the
order
to
fire
At
the
September
meeting
the
principals
approved
the
draft
presidential
directive
with
little
discussion
Rice
told
us
that
she
had
at
some
point
told
President
Bush
that
she
and
his
other
advisers
thought
it
would
take
three
years
or
so
for
their
al
Qaeda
strategy
to
work
They
then
discussed
the
armed
Predator
Hadley
portrayed
the
Predator
as
useful
tool
although
perhaps
not
for
immediate
use
Rice
who
had
been
advised
by
her
staff
that
the
armed
Predator
was
not
ready
for
deployment
commented
about
the
potential
for
using
the
armed
Predator
in
the
spring
of
2002
The
State
Department
supported
the
armed
Predator
although
Secretary
Powell
was
not
convinced
that
Bin
Ladin
was
as
easy
to
target
as
had
been
suggested
Treasury
Secretary
Paul
O'Neill
was
skittish
cautioning
about
the
implications
of
trying
to
kill
an
individual
The
Defense
Department
favored
strong
action
Deputy
Secretary
Wolfowitz
questioned
the
United
States'
ability
to
deliver
Bin
Ladin
and
bring
him
to
justice
He
favored
going
after
Bin
Ladin
as
part
of
larger
air
strike
similar
to
what
had
been
done
in
the
1986
U.S
strike
against
Libya
General
Myers
emphasized
the
Predator's
value
for
surveillance
perhaps
enabling
broader
air
strikes
that
would
go
beyond
Bin
Ladin
to
attack
al
Qaeda's
training
infrastructure
The
principals
also
discussed
which
agency-CIA
or
Defense-should
have
the
authority
to
fire
missile
from
the
armed
Predator
At
the
end
Rice
summarized
the
meeting's
conclusions
The
armed
Predator
capability
was
needed
but
not
ready
The
Predator
would
be
available
for
the
military
to
consider
along
with
its
other
options
The
CIA
should
consider
flying
reconnaissance-only
missions
The
principals-including
the
previously
reluctant
Tenet-thought
that
such
reconnaissance
flights
were
good
idea
combined
with
other
efforts
to
get
actionable
intelligence
Tenet
deferred
an
answer
on
the
additional
reconnaissance
flights
conferred
with
his
staff
after
the
meeting
and
then
directed
the
CIA
to
press
ahead
with
them
few
days
later
final
version
of
the
draft
presidential
directive
was
circulated
incorporating
two
minor
changes
made
by
the
principals
On
September
9
dramatic
news
arrived
from
Afghanistan
The
leader
of
the
Northern
Alliance
Ahmed
Shah
Massoud
had
granted
an
interview
in
his
bungalow
near
the
Tajikistan
border
with
two
men
whom
the
Northern
Alliance
leader
had
been
told
were
Arab
journalists
The
supposed
reporter
and
cameraman-actually
al
Qaeda
assassins-then
set
off
bomb
riddling
Massoud's
chest
with
shrapnel
He
died
minutes
later
On
September
10
Hadley
gathered
the
deputies
to
finalize
their
threephase
multiyear
plan
to
pressure
and
perhaps
ultimately
topple
theTaliban
leadership
That
same
day
Hadley
instructed
DCI
Tenet
to
have
the
CIA
prepare
new
draft
legal
authorities
for
the
"broad
covert
action
program"
envisioned
by
the
draft
presidential
directive
Hadley
also
directedTenet
to
prepare
separate
section
"authorizing
broad
range
of
other
covert
activities
including
authority
to
capture
or
to
use
lethal
force"
against
al
Qaeda
command-and-control
elements
This
section
would
supersede
the
Clinton-era
documents
Hadley
wanted
the
authorities
to
be
flexible
and
broad
enough
"to
cover
any
additional
UBL-related
covert
actions
contemplated."
Funding
still
needed
to
be
located
The
military
component
remained
unclear
Pakistan
remained
uncooperative
The
domestic
policy
institutions
were
largely
uninvolved
But
the
pieces
were
coming
together
for
an
integrated
policy
dealing
with
al
Qaeda
the
Taliban
and
Pakistan
"WE
HAVE
SOME
PLANES"
Tuesday
September
11
2001
dawned
temperate
and
nearly
cloudless
in
the
eastern
United
States
Millions
of
men
and
women
readied
themselves
for
work
Some
made
their
way
to
the
Twin
Towers
the
signature
structures
of
the
World
Trade
Center
complex
in
New
York
City
Others
went
to
Arlington
Virginia
to
the
Pentagon
Across
the
Potomac
River
the
United
States
Congress
was
back
in
session
At
the
other
end
of
Pennsylvania
Avenue
people
began
to
line
up
for
White
House
tour
In
Sarasota
Florida
President
George
W
Bush
went
for
an
early
morning
run
For
those
heading
to
an
airport
weather
conditions
could
not
have
been
better
for
safe
and
pleasant
journey
Among
the
travelers
were
Mohamed
Atta
and
Abdul
Aziz
al
Omari
who
arrived
at
the
airport
in
Portland
Maine
INSIDE
THE
FOUR
FLIGHTS
Boarding
the
Flights
Boston:
American
11
and
United
175
Atta
and
Omari
boarded
6:00
A.M
flight
from
Portland
to
Boston's
Logan
International
Airport
When
he
checked
in
for
his
flight
to
Boston
Atta
was
selected
by
computerized
prescreening
system
known
as
CAPPS
(Computer
Assisted
Passenger
Prescreening
System)
created
to
identify
passengers
who
should
be
subject
to
special
security
measures
Under
security
rules
in
place
at
the
time
the
only
consequence
of
Atta's
selection
by
CAPPS
was
that
his
checked
bags
were
held
off
the
plane
until
it
was
confirmed
that
he
had
boarded
the
aircraft
This
did
not
hinder
Atta's
plans
Atta
and
Omari
arrived
in
Boston
at
6:45
Seven
minutes
later
Atta
apparently
took
call
from
Marwan
al
Shehhi
longtime
colleague
who
was
at
another
terminal
at
Logan
Airport
They
spoke
for
three
minutes
It
would
be
their
final
conversation
Between
6:45
and
7:40
Atta
and
Omari
along
with
Satam
al
Suqami
Wail
al
Shehri
and
Waleed
al
Shehri
checked
in
and
boarded
American
Airlines
Flight
11
bound
for
Los
Angeles
The
flight
was
scheduled
to
depart
at
7:45
In
another
Logan
terminal
Shehhi
joined
by
Fayez
Banihammad
Mohand
al
Shehri
Ahmed
al
Ghamdi
and
Hamza
al
Ghamdi
checked
in
for
United
Airlines
Flight
175
also
bound
for
Los
Angeles
couple
of
Shehhi's
colleagues
were
obviously
unused
to
travel;
according
to
the
United
ticket
agent
they
had
trouble
understanding
the
standard
security
questions
and
she
had
to
go
over
them
slowly
until
they
gave
the
routine
reassuring
answers
Their
flight
was
scheduled
to
depart
at
8:00
The
security
checkpoints
through
which
passengers
including
Atta
and
his
colleagues
gained
access
to
the
American
11
gate
were
operated
by
Globe
Security
under
contract
with
American
Airlines
In
different
terminal
the
single
checkpoint
through
which
passengers
for
United
175
passed
was
controlled
by
United
Airlines
which
had
contracted
with
Huntleigh
USA
to
perform
the
screening
In
passing
through
these
checkpoints
each
of
the
hijackers
would
have
been
screened
by
walk-through
metal
detector
calibrated
to
detect
items
with
at
least
the
metal
content
of
.22-caliber
handgun
Anyone
who
might
have
set
off
that
detector
would
have
been
screened
with
hand
wand-a
procedure
requiring
the
screener
to
identify
the
metal
item
or
items
that
caused
the
alarm
In
addition
an
X-ray
machine
would
have
screened
the
hijackers'
carry-on
belongings
The
screening
was
in
place
to
identify
and
confiscate
weapons
and
other
items
prohibited
from
being
carried
onto
commercial
flight
None
of
the
checkpoint
supervisors
recalled
the
hijackers
or
reported
anything
suspicious
regarding
their
screening
While
Atta
had
been
selected
by
CAPPS
in
Portland
three
members
of
his
hijacking
team-Suqami
Wail
al
Shehri
and
Waleed
al
Shehri-were
selected
in
Boston
Their
selection
affected
only
the
handling
of
their
checked
bags
not
their
screening
at
the
checkpoint
All
five
men
cleared
the
checkpoint
and
made
their
way
to
the
gate
for
American
11
Atta
Omari
and
Suqami
took
their
seats
in
business
class
(seats
8D
8G
and
10B
respectively)
The
Shehri
brothers
had
adjacent
seats
in
row
(Wail
in
2A
Waleed
in
2B)
in
the
firstclass
cabin
They
boarded
American
11
between
7:31
and
7:40
The
aircraft
pushed
back
from
the
gate
at
7:40
Shehhi
and
his
team
none
of
whom
had
been
selected
by
CAPPS
boarded
United
175
between
7:23
and
7:28
(Banihammad

Hundreds
of
miles
southwest
of
Boston
at
Dulles
International
Airport
in
the
Virginia
suburbs
of
Washington
D.C.
five
more
men
were
preparing
to
take
their
early
morning
flight
At
7:15
pair
of
them
Khalid
al
Mihdhar
and
Majed
Moqed
checked
in
at
the
American
Airlines
ticket
counter
for
Flight
77
bound
for
Los
Angeles
Within
the
next
20
minutes
they
would
be
followed
by
Hani
Hanjour
and
two
brothers
Nawaf
al
Hazmi
and
Salem
al
Hazmi
Hani
Hanjour
Khalid
al
Mihdhar
and
Majed
Moqed
were
flagged
by
CAPPS
The
Hazmi
brothers
were
also
selected
for
extra
scrutiny
by
the
airline's
customer
service
representative
at
the
check-in
counter
He
did
so
because
one
of
the
brothers
did
not
have
photo
identification
nor
could
he
understand
English
and
because
the
agent
found
both
of
the
passengers
to
be
suspicious
The
only
consequence
of
their
selection
was
that
their
checked
bags
were
held
off
the
plane
until
it
was
confirmed
that
they
had
boarded
the
aircraft
All
five
hijackers
passed
through
the
Main
Terminal's
west
security
screening
checkpoint;
United
Airlines
which
was
the
responsible
air
carrier
had
contracted
out
the
work
to
Argenbright
Security
The
checkpoint
featured
closed-circuit
television
that
recorded
all
passengers
including
the
hijackers
as
they
were
screened
At
7:18
Mihdhar
and
Moqed
entered
the
security
checkpoint
Mihdhar
and
Moqed
placed
their
carry-on
bags
on
the
belt
of
the
X-ray
machine
and
proceeded
through
the
first
metal
detector
Both
set
off
the
alarm
and
they
were
directed
to
second
metal
detector
Mihdhar
did
not
trigger
the
alarm
and
was
permitted
through
the
checkpoint
After
Moqed
set
it
off
screener
wanded
him
He
passed
this
inspection
About
20
minutes
later
at
7:35
another
passenger
for
Flight
77
Hani
Hanjour
placed
two
carry-on
bags
on
the
X-ray
belt
in
the
Main
Terminal's
west
checkpoint
and
proceeded
without
alarm
through
the
metal
detector
short
time
later
Nawaf
and
Salem
al
Hazmi
entered
the
same
checkpoint
Salem
al
Hazmi
cleared
the
metal
detector
and
was
permitted
through;
Nawaf
al
Hazmi
set
off
the
alarms
for
both
the
first
and
second
metal
detectors
and
was
then
hand-wanded
before
being
passed
In
addition
his
over-the-shoulder
carry-on
bag
was
swiped
by
an
explosive
trace
detector
and
then
passed
The
video
footage
indicates
that
he
was
carrying
an
unidentified
item
in
his
back
pocket
clipped
to
its
rim
When
the
local
civil
aviation
security
office
of
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
later
investigated
these
security
screening
operations
the
screeners
recalled
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
They
could
not
recall
that
any
of
the
passengers
they
screened
were
CAPPS
selectees
We
asked
screening
expert
to
review
the
videotape
of
the
hand-wanding
and
he
found
the
quality
of
the
screener's
work
to
have
been
"marginal
at
best."
The
screener
should
have
"resolved"
what
set
off
the
alarm;
and
in
the
case
of
both
Moqed
and
Hazmi
it
was
clear
that
he
did
not
At
7:50
Majed
Moqed
and
Khalid
al
Mihdhar
boarded
the
flight
and
were
seated
in
12A
and
12B

Hani
Hanjour
assigned
to

checked
in
at
the
United

counter
for
Flight

going
to
Los

Two
checked

two
did
not
Haznawi
was
selected
by
CAPPS
His
checked
bag
was
screened
for
explosives
and
then
loaded
on
the
plane
The
four
men
passed
through
the
security
checkpoint
owned
by
United
Airlines
and
operated
under
contract
by
Argenbright
Security
Like
the
checkpoints
in
Boston
it
lacked
closed-circuit
television
surveillance
so
there
is
no
documentary
evidence
to
indicate
when
the
hijackers
passed
through
the
checkpoint
what
alarms
may
have
been
triggered
or
what
security
procedures
were
administered
The
FAA
interviewed
the
screeners
later;
none
recalled
anything
unusual
or
suspicious
The
four
men
boarded
the
plane
between
7:39
and
7:48
All
four
had
seats
in
the
first-class
cabin;
their
plane
had
no
business-class
section
Jarrah
was
in
seat
1B
closest
to
the
cockpit;
Nami
was
in
3C
Ghamdi
in
3D
and
Haznawi
in
6B
The
19
men
were
aboard
four
transcontinental
flights
They
were
planning
to
hijack
these
planes
and
turn
them
into
large
guided
missiles
loaded
with
up
to
11,400
gallons
of
jet
fuel
By
8:00
A.M
on
the
morning
of
Tuesday
September
11,2001
they
had
defeated
all
the
security
layers
that
America's
civil
aviation
security
system
then
had
in
place
to
prevent
hijacking
The
Hijacking
of
American
11
American
Airlines
Flight
11
provided
nonstop
service
from
Boston
to
Los
Angeles
On
September
11
Captain
John
Ogonowski
and
First
Officer
Thomas
McGuinness
piloted
the
Boeing
767
It
carried
its
full
capacity
of
nine
flight
attendants
Eighty-one
passengers
boarded
the
flight
with
them
(including
the
five
terrorists).22
The
plane
took
off
at
7:59
Just
before
8:14
it
had
climbed
to
26,000
feet
not
quite
its
initial
assigned
cruising
altitude
of
29,000
feet
All
communications
and
flight
profile
data
were
normal
About
this
time
the
"Fasten
Seatbelt"
sign
would
usually
have
been
turned
off
and
the
flight
attendants
would
have
begun
preparing
for
cabin
service
At
that
same
time
American
11
had
its
last
routine
communication
with
the
ground
when
it
acknowledged
navigational
instructions
from
the
FAA's
air
traffic
control
(ATC)
center
in
Boston
Sixteen
seconds
after
that
transmission
ATC
instructed
the
aircraft's
pilots
to
climb
to
35,000
feet
That
message
and
all
subsequent
attempts
to
contact
the
flight
were
not
acknowledged
From
this
and
other
evidence
we
believe
the
hijacking
began
at
8:14
or
shortly
thereafter
Reports
from
two
flight
attendants
in
the
coach
cabin
Betty
Ong
and
Madeline
"Amy"
Sweeney
tell
us
most
of
what
we
know
about
how
the
hijacking
happened
As
it
began
some
of
the
hijackers-most
likely
Wail
al
Shehri
and
Waleed
al
Shehri
who
were
seated
in
row
in
first
class-stabbed
the
two
unarmed
flight
attendants
who
would
have
been
preparing
for
cabin
service
We
do
not
know
exactly
how
the
hijackers
gained
access
to
the
cockpit;
FAA
rules
required
that
the
doors
remain
closed
and
locked
during
flight
Ong
speculated
that
they
had
"jammed
their
way"
in
Perhaps
the
terrorists
stabbed
the
flight
attendants
to
get
cockpit
key
to
force
one
of
them
to
open
the
cockpit
door
or
to
lure
the
captain
or
first
officer
out
of
the
cockpit
Or
the
flight
attendants
may
just
have
been
in
their
way
At
the
same
time
or
shortly
thereafter
Atta-the
only
terrorist
on
board
trained
to
fly
jet-would
have
moved
to
the
cockpit
from
his
business-class
seat
possibly
accompanied
by
Omari
As
this
was
happening
passenger
Daniel
Lewin
who
was
seated
in
the
row
just
behind
Atta
and
Omari
was
stabbed
by
one
of
the
hijackers-probably
Satam
al
Suqami
who
was
seated
directly
behind
Lewin
Lewin
had
served
four
years
as
an
officer
in
the
Israeli
military
He
may
have
made
an
attempt
to
stop
the
hijackers
in
front
of
him
not
realizing
that
another
was
sitting
behind
him
The
hijackers
quickly
gained
control
and
sprayed
Mace
pepper
spray
or
some
other
irritant
in
the
first-class
cabin
in
order
to
force
the
passengers
and
flight
attendants
toward
the
rear
of
the
plane
They
claimed
they
had
bomb
About
five
minutes
after
the
hijacking
began
Betty
Ong
contacted
the
American
Airlines
Southeastern
Reservations
Office
in
Cary
North
Carolina
via
an
AT&T
airphone
to
report
an
emergency
aboard
the
flight
This
was
the
first
of
several
occasions
on
9/11
when
flight
attendants
took
action
outside
the
scope
of
their
training
which
emphasized
that
in
hijacking
they
were
to
communicate
with
the
cockpit
crew
The
emergency
call
lasted
approximately
25
minutes
as
Ong
calmly
and
professionally
relayed
information
about
events
taking
place
aboard
the
airplane
to
authorities
on
the
ground
At
8:19
Ong
reported:"The
cockpit
is
not
answering
somebody's
stabbed
in
business
class-and
think
there's
Mace-that
we
can't
breathe-I
don't
know
think
we're
getting
hijacked."
She
then
told
of
the
stabbings
of
the
two
flight
attendants
At
8:21
one
of
the
American
employees
receiving
Ong's
call
in
North
Carolina
Nydia
Gonzalez
alerted
the
American
Airlines
operations
center
in
Fort
Worth
Texas
reaching
Craig
Marquis
the
manager
on
duty
Marquis
soon
realized
this
was
an
emergency
and
instructed
the
airline's
dispatcher
responsible
for
the
flight
to
contact
the
cockpit
At
8:23
the
dispatcher
tried
unsuccessfully
to
contact
the
aircraft
Six
minutes
later
the
air
traffic
control
specialist
in
American's
operations
center
contacted
the
FAA's
Boston
Air
Traffic
Control
Center
about
the
flight
The
center
was
already
aware
of
the
problem
Boston
Center
knew
of
problem
on
the
flight
in
part
because
just
before
8:25
the
hijackers
had
attempted
to
communicate
with
the
passengers
The
microphone
was
keyed
and
immediately
one
of
the
hijackers
said
"Nobody
move
Everything
will
be
okay
If
you
try
to
make
any
moves
you'll
endanger
yourself
and
the
airplane
Just
stay
quiet."
Air
traffic
controllers
heard
the
transmission;
Ong
did
not
The
hijackers
probably
did
not
know
how
to
operate
the
cockpit
radio
communication
system
correctly
and
thus
inadvertently
broadcast
their
message
over
the
air
traffic
control
channel
instead
of
the
cabin
public-address
channel
Also
at
8:25
and
again
at
8:29
Amy
Sweeney
got
through
to
the
American
Flight
Services
Office
in
Boston
but
was
cut
off
after
she
reported
someone
was
hurt
aboard
the
flight
Three
minutes
later
Sweeney
was
reconnected
to
the
office
and
began
relaying
updates
to
the
manager
Michael
Woodward
At
8:26
Ong
reported
that
the
plane
was
"flying
erratically."
minute
later
Flight
11
turned
south
American
also
began
getting
identifications
of
the
hijackers
as
Ong
and
then
Sweeney
passed
on
some
of
the
seat
numbers
of
those
who
had
gained
unauthorized
access
to
the
cockpit
Sweeney
calmly
reported
on
her
line
that
the
plane
had
been
hijacked;
man
in
first
class
had
his
throat
slashed;
two
flight
attendants
had
been
stabbed-one
was
seriously
hurt
and
was
on
oxygen
while
the
other's
wounds
seemed
minor;
doctor
had
been
requested;
the
flight
attendants
were
unable
to
contact
the
cockpit;
and
there
was
bomb
in
the
cockpit
Sweeney
told
Woodward
that
she
and
Ong
were
trying
to
relay
as
much
information
as
they
could
to
people
on
the
ground
At
8:38
Ong
told
Gonzalez
that
the
plane
was
flying
erratically
again
Around
this
time
Sweeney
told
Woodward
that
the
hijackers
were
Middle
Easterners
naming
three
of
their
seat
numbers
One
spoke
very
little
English
and
one
spoke
excellent
English
The
hijackers
had
gained
entry
to
the
cockpit
and
she
did
not
know
how
The
aircraft
was
in
rapid
descent
At
8:41
Sweeney
told
Woodward
that
passengers
in
coach
were
under
the
impression
that
there
was
routine
medical
emergency
in
first
class
Other
flight
attendants
were
busy
at
duties
such
as
getting
medical
supplies
while
Ong
and
Sweeney
were
reporting
the
events
At
8:41
in
American's
operations
center
colleague
told
Marquis
that
the
air
traffic
controllers
declared
Flight
11
hijacking
and
"think
he's
[American
11]
headed
toward
Kennedy
[airport
in
New
York
City]
They're
moving
everybody
out
of
the
way
They
seem
to
have
him
on
primary
radar
They
seem
to
think
that
he
is
descending."
At
8:44
Gonzalez
reported
losing
phone
contact
with
Ong
About
this
same
time
Sweeney
reported
to
Woodward
"Something
is
wrong
We
are
in
rapid
descent
we
are
all
over
the
place."
Woodward
asked
Sweeney
to
look
out
the
window
to
see
if
she
could
determine
where
they
were
Sweeney
responded:"We
are
flying
low
We
are
flying
very
very
low
We
are
flying
way
too
low."
Seconds
later
she
said,"Oh
my
God
we
are
way
too
low."
The
phone
call
ended
At
8:46:40
American
11
crashed
into
the
North
Tower
of
the
World
Trade
Center
in
New

City
All
on
board
along
with
an
unknown
number
of
people
in
the
tower
were
killed
instantly
The
Hijacking
of

United

was
scheduled
to
depart
for
Los
Angeles
at
8:00
Captain
Victor
Saracini
and
First
Officer
Michael
Horrocks
piloted
the
Boeing
767
which
had
seven
flight
attendants
Fifty-six
passengers
boarded
the
flight
United
175
pushed
back
from
its
gate
at
7:58
and
departed
Logan
Airport
at
8:14
By
8:33
it
had
reached
its
assigned
cruising
altitude
of
31,000
feet
The
flight
attendants
would
have
begun
their
cabin
service
The
flight
had
taken
off
just
as
American
11
was
being
hijacked
and
at
8:42
the
United
175
flight
crew
completed
their
report
on
"suspicious
transmission"
overheard
from
another
plane
(which
turned
out
to
have
been
Flight
11)
just
after
takeoff
This
was
United
175's
last
communication
with
the
ground
The
hijackers
attacked
sometime
between
8:42
and
8:46
They
used
knives
(as
reported
by
two
passengers
and
flight
attendant)
Mace
(reported
by
one
passenger)
and
the
threat
of
bomb
(reported
by
the
same
passenger)
They
stabbed
members
of
the
flight
crew
(reported
by
flight
attendant
and
one
passenger)
Both
pilots
had
been
killed
(reported
by
one
flight
attendant)
The
eyewitness
accounts
came
from
calls
made
from
the
rear
of
the
plane
from
passengers
originally
seated
further
forward
in
the
cabin
sign
that
passengers
and
perhaps
crew
had
been
moved
to
the
back
of
the
aircraft
Given
similarities
to
American
11
in
hijacker
seating
and
in
eyewitness
reports
of
tactics
and
weapons
as
well
as
the
contact
between
the
presumed
team
leaders
Atta
and
Shehhi
we
believe
the
tactics
were
similar
on
both
flights
The
first
operational
evidence
that
something
was
abnormal
on
United
175
came
at
8:47
when
the
aircraft
changed
beacon
codes
twice
within
minute
At
8:51
the
flight
deviated
from
its
assigned
altitude
and
minute
later
New
York
air
traffic
controllers
began
repeatedly
and
unsuccessfully
trying
to
contact
it
At
8:52
in
Easton
Connecticut
man
named
Lee
Hanson
received
phone
call
from
his
son
Peter
passenger
on
United
175
His
son
told
him:
"I
think
they've
taken
over
the
cockpit-An
attendant
has
been
stabbed-
and
someone
else
up
front
may
have
been
killed
The
plane
is
making
strange
moves
Call
United
Airlines-Tell
them
it's
Flight
175

to
LA."
Lee
Hanson
then
called
the
Easton
Police
Department
and
relayed
what
he
had
heard
Also
at
8:52
male
flight
attendant
called
United
office
in
San
Francisco
reaching
Marc
Policastro
The
flight
attendant
reported
that
the
flight
had
been
hijacked
both
pilots
had
been
killed
flight
attendant
had
been
stabbed
and
the
hijackers
were
probably
flying
the
plane
The
call
lasted
about
two
minutes
after
which
Policastro
and
colleague
tried
unsuccessfully
to
contact
the
flight
At
8:58
the
flight
took
heading
toward
New

City
At
8:59
Flight
175
passenger
Brian
David
Sweeney
tried
to
call
his
wife
Julie
He
left
message
on
their
home
answering
machine
that
the
plane
had
been
hijacked
He
then
called
his
mother
Louise
Sweeney
told
her
the
flight
had
been
hijacked
and
added
that
the
passengers
were
thinking
about
storming
the
cockpit
to
take
control
of
the
plane
away
from
the
hijackers
At
9:00
Lee
Hanson
received
second
call
from
his
son
Peter:
It's
getting
bad
Dad-A
stewardess
was
stabbed-They
seem
to
have
knives
and
Mace-They
said
they
have
bomb-It's
getting
very
bad
on
the
plane-Passengers
are
throwing
up
and
getting
sick-The
plane
is
making
jerky
movements-I
don't
think
the
pilot
is
flying
the
plane-I
think
we
are
going
down-I
think
they
intend
to
go
to
Chicago
or
someplace
and
fly
into
building-Don't
worry
Dad-
If
it
happens
it'll
be
very
fast-My
God
my
God
The
call
ended
abruptly
Lee
Hanson
had
heard
woman
scream
just
before
it
cut
off
He
turned
on
television
and
in
her
home
so
did
Louise
Sweeney
Both
then
saw
the
second
aircraft
hit
the
World
Trade
Center
At
9:03:11
United
Airlines
Flight
175
struck
the
South
Tower
of
the
World
Trade
Center
All
on
board
along
with
an
unknown
number
of
people
in
the
tower
were
killed
instantly
The
Hijacking
of
American
77
American
Airlines
Flight
77
was
scheduled
to
depart
from
Washington
Dulles
for
Los
Angeles
at
8:10
The
aircraft
was
Boeing
757
piloted
by
Captain
Charles
F
Burlingame
and
First
Officer
David
Charlebois
There
were
four
flight
attendants
On
September
11
the
flight
carried
58
passengers
American
77
pushed
back
from
its
gate
at
8:09
and
took
off
at
8:20
At
8:46
the
flight
reached
its
assigned
cruising
altitude
of
35,000
feet
Cabin
service
would
have
begun
At
8:51
American
77
transmitted
its
last
routine
radio
communication
The
hijacking
began
between
8:51
and
8:54
As
on
American
11
and
United
175
the
hijackers
used
knives
(reported
by
one
passenger)
and
moved
all
the
passengers
(and
possibly
crew)
to
the
rear
of
the
aircraft
(reported
by
one
flight
attendant
and
one
passenger)
Unlike
the
earlier
flights
the
Flight
77
hijackers
were
reported
by
passenger
to
have
box
cutters
Finally
passenger
reported
that
an
announcement
had
been
made
by
the
"pilot"
that
the
plane
had
been
hijacked
Neither
of
the
firsthand
accounts
mentioned
any
stabbings
or
the
threat
or
use
of
either
bomb
or
Mace
though
both
witnesses
began
the
flight
in
the
first-class
cabin
At
8:54
the
aircraft
deviated
from
its
assigned
course
turning
south
Two
minutes
later
the
transponder
was
turned
off
and
even
primary
radar
contact
with
the
aircraft
was
lost
The
Indianapolis
Air
Traffic
Control
Center
repeatedly
tried
and
failed
to
contact
the
aircraft
American
Airlines
dispatchers
also
tried
without
success
At
9:00
American
Airlines
Executive
Vice
President
Gerard
Arpey
learned
that
communications
had
been
lost
with
American
77
This
was
now
the
second
American
aircraft
in
trouble
He
ordered
all
American
Airlines
flights
in
the
Northeast
that
had
not
taken
off
to
remain
on
the
ground
Shortly
before
9:10
suspecting
that
American
77
had
been
hijacked
American
headquarters
concluded
that
the
second
aircraft
to
hit
the
World
Trade
Center
might
have
been
Flight
77
After
learning
that
United
Airlines
was
missing
plane
American
Airlines
headquarters
extended
the
ground
stop
nationwide
At
9:12
Renee
May
called
her
mother
Nancy
May
in
Las
Vegas
She
said
her
flight
was
being
hijacked
by
six
individuals
who
had
moved
them
to
the
rear
of
the
plane
She
asked
her
mother
to
alert
American
Airlines
Nancy
May
and
her
husband
promptly
did
so
At
some
point
between
9:16
and
9:26
Barbara
Olson
called
her
husband
Ted
Olson
the
solicitor
general
of
the
United
States
She
reported
that
the
flight
had
been
hijacked
and
the
hijackers
had
knives
and
box
cutters
She
further
indicated
that
the
hijackers
were
not
aware
of
her
phone
call
and
that
they
had
put
all
the
passengers
in
the
back
of
the
plane
About
minute
into
the
conversation
the
call
was
cut
off
Solicitor
General
Olson
tried
unsuccessfully
to
reach
Attorney
General
John
Ashcroft
Shortly
after
the
first
call
Barbara
Olson
reached
her
husband
again
She
reported
that
the
pilot
had
announced
that
the
flight
had
been
hijacked
and
she
asked
her
husband
what
she
should
tell
the
captain
to
do
Ted
Olson
asked
for
her
location
and
she
replied
that
the
aircraft
was
then
flying
over
houses
Another
passenger
told
her
they
were
traveling
northeast
The
Solicitor
General
then
informed
his
wife
of
the
two
previous
hijackings
and
crashes
She
did
not
display
signs
of
panic
and
did
not
indicate
any
awareness
of
an
impending
crash
At
that
point
the
second
call
was
cut
off
At
9:29
the
autopilot
on
American
77
was
disengaged;
the
aircraft
was
at
7,000
feet
and
approximately
38
miles
west
of
the
Pentagon
At
9:32
controllers
at
the
Dulles
Terminal
Radar
Approach
Control
"observed
primary
radar
target
tracking
eastbound
at
high
rate
of
speed."
This
was
later
determined
to
have
been
Flight
77
At
9:34
Ronald
Reagan
Washington
National
Airport
advised
the
Secret
Service
of
an
unknown
aircraft
heading
in
the
direction
of
the
White
House
American
77
was
then
miles
west-southwest
of
the
Pentagon
and
began
330-degree
turn
At
the
end
of
the
turn
it
was
descending
through
2,200
feet
pointed
toward
the
Pentagon
and
downtown
Washington
The
hijacker
pilot
then
advanced
the
throttles
to
maximum
power
and
dove
toward
the
Pentagon
At
9:37:46
American
Airlines
Flight
77
crashed
into
the
Pentagon
traveling
at
approximately
530
miles
per
hour
All
on
board
as
well
as
many
civilian
and
military
personnel
in
the
building
were
killed
The
Battle
for
United
93
At
8:42
United
Airlines
Flight
93
took
off
from
Newark
(New
Jersey)
Liberty
International
Airport
bound
for
San
Francisco
The
aircraft
was
piloted
by
Captain
Jason
Dahl
and
First
Officer
Leroy
Homer
and
there
were
five
flight
attendants
Thirty-seven
passengers
including
the
hijackers
boarded
the
plane
Scheduled
to
depart
the
gate
at
8:00
the
Boeing
757's
takeoff
was
delayed
because
of
the
airport's
typically
heavy
morning
traffic
The
hijackers
had
planned
to
take
flights
scheduled
to
depart
at
7:45
(American
11)
8:00
(United
175
and
United
93)
and
8:10
(American
77)
Three
of
the
flights
had
actually
taken
off
within
10
to
15
minutes
of
their
planned
departure
times
United
93
would
ordinarily
have
taken
off
about
15
minutes
after
pulling
away
from
the
gate
When
it
left
the
ground
at
8:42
the
flight
was
running
more
than
25
minutes
late
As
United
93
left
Newark
the
flight's
crew
members
were
unaware
of
the
hijacking
of
American
11
Around
9:00
the
FAA
American
and
United
were
facing
the
staggering
realization
of
apparent
multiple
hijackings
At
9:03
they
would
see
another
aircraft
strike
the
World
Trade
Center
Crisis
managers
at
the
FAA
and
the
airlines
did
not
yet
act
to
warn
other
aircraft
At
the
same
time
Boston
Center
realized
that
message
transmitted
just
before
8:25
by
the
hijacker
pilot
of
American
11
included
the
phrase
"We
have
some
planes."
No
one
at
the
FAA
or
the
airlines
that
day
had
ever
dealt
with
multiple
hijackings
Such
plot
had
not
been
carried
out
anywhere
in
the
world
in
more
than
30
years
and
never
in
the
United
States
As
news
of
the
hijackings
filtered
through
the
FAA
and
the
airlines
it
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
their
leadership
that
they
needed
to
alert
other
aircraft
in
the
air
that
they
too
might
be
at
risk
United
175
was
hijacked
between
8:42
and
8:46
and
awareness
of
that
hijacking
began
to
spread
after
8:51
American
77
was
hijacked
between
8:51
and
8:54
By
9:00
FAA
and
airline
officials
began
to
comprehend
that
attackers
were
going
after
multiple
aircraft
American
Airlines'
nationwide
ground
stop
between
9:05
and
9:10
was
followed
by
United
Airlines
ground
stop
FAA
controllers
at
Boston
Center
which
had
tracked
the
first
two
hijackings
requested
at
9:07
that
Herndon
Command
Center
"get
messages
to
airborne
aircraft
to
increase
security
for
the
cockpit."
There
is
no
evidence
that
Herndon
took
such
action
Boston
Center
immediately
began
speculating
about
other
aircraft
that
might
be
in
danger
leading
them
to
worry
about
transcontinental
flight-Delta
1989-that
in
fact
was
not
hijacked
At
9:19
the
FAA's
New
England
regional
office
called
Herndon
and
asked
that
Cleveland
Center
advise
Delta
1989
to
use
extra
cockpit
security
Several
FAA
air
traffic
control
officials
told
us
it
was
the
air
carriers'
responsibility
to
notify
their
planes
of
security
problems
One
senior
FAA
air
traffic
control
manager
said
that
it
was
simply
not
the
FAA's
place
to
order
the
airlines
what
to
tell
their
pilots
We
believe
such
statements
do
not
reflect
an
adequate
appreciation
of
the
FAA's
responsibility
for
the
safety
and
security
of
civil
aviation
The
airlines
bore
responsibility
too
They
were
facing
an
escalating
number
of
conflicting
and
for
the
most
part
erroneous
reports
about
other
flights
as
well
as
continuing
lack
of
vital
information
from
the
FAA
about
the
hijacked
flights
We
found
no
evidence
however
that
American
Airlines
sent
any
cockpit
warnings
to
its
aircraft
on
9/11
United's
first
decisive
action
to
notify
its
airborne
aircraft
to
take
defensive
action
did
not
come
until
9:19
when
United
flight
dispatcher
Ed
Ballinger
took
the
initiative
to
begin
transmitting
warnings
to
his
16
transcontinental
flights:
"Beware
any
cockpit
intrusion-
Two
a/c
[aircraft]
hit
World
Trade
Center."
One
of
the
flights
that
received
the
warning
was
United
93
Because
Ballinger
was
still
responsible
for
his
other
flights
as
well
as
Flight
175
his
warning
message
was
not
transmitted
to
Flight
93
until
9:23
By
all
accounts
the
first
46
minutes
of
Flight
93's
cross-country
trip
proceeded
routinely
Radio
communications
from
the
plane
were
normal
Heading
speed
and
altitude
ran
according
to
plan
At
9:24
Ballinger's
warning
to
United
93
was
received
in
the
cockpit
Within
two
minutes
at
9:26
the
pilot
Jason
Dahl
responded
with
note
of
puzzlement:
"Ed
confirm
latest
mssg
plz-Jason."
The
hijackers
attacked
at
9:28
While
traveling
35,000
feet
above
eastern
Ohio
United
93
suddenly
dropped
700
feet
Eleven
seconds
into
the
descent
the
FAA's
air
traffic
control
center
in
Cleveland
received
the
first
of
two
radio
transmissions
from
the
aircraft
During
the
first
broadcast
the
captain
or
first
officer
could
be
heard
declaring
"Mayday"
amid
the
sounds
of
physical
struggle
in
the
cockpit
The
second
radio
transmission
35
seconds
later
indicated
that
the
fight
was
continuing
The
captain
or
first
officer
could
be
heard
shouting:"
Hey
get
out
of
here-get
out
of
here-get
out
of
here."
On
the
morning
of
9/11
there
were
only
37
passengers
on
United
93-33
in
addition
to
the
hijackers
This
was
below
the
norm
for
Tuesday
mornings
during
the
summer
of
2001
But
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
hijackers
manipulated
passenger
levels
or
purchased
additional
seats
to
facilitate
their
operation
The
terrorists
who
hijacked
three
other
commercial
flights
on
9/11
operated
in
five-man
teams
They
initiated
their
cockpit
takeover
within
30
minutes
of
takeoff
On
Flight
93
however
the
takeover
took
place
46
minutes
after
takeoff
and
there
were
only
four
hijackers
The
operative
likely
intended
to
round
out
the
team
for
this
flight
Mohamed
al
Kahtani
had
been
refused
entry
by
suspicious
immigration
inspector
at
Florida's
Orlando
International
Airport
in
August
Because
several
passengers
on
United
93
described
three
hijackers
on
the
plane
not
four
some
have
wondered
whether
one
of
the
hijackers
had
been
able
to
use
the
cockpit
jump
seat
from
the
outset
of
the
flight
FAA
rules
allow
use
of
this
seat
by
documented
and
approved
individuals
usually
air
carrier
or
FAA
personnel
We
have
found
no
evidence
indicating
that
one
of
the
hijackers
or
anyone
else
sat
there
on
this
flight
All
the
hijackers
had
assigned
seats
in
first
class
and
they
seem
to
have
used
them
We
believe
it
is
more
likely
that
Jarrah
the
crucial
pilot-trained
member
of
their
team
remained
seated
and
inconspicuous
until
after
the
cockpit
was
seized;
and
once
inside
he
would
not
have
been
visible
to
the
passengers
At
9:32
hijacker
probably
Jarrah
made
or
attempted
to
make
the
following
announcement
to
the
passengers
of
Flight
93:"Ladies
and
Gentlemen:
Here
the
captain
please
sit
down
keep
remaining
sitting
We
have
bomb
on
board
So
sit."
The
flight
data
recorder
(also
recovered)
indicates
that
Jarrah
then
instructed
the
plane's
autopilot
to
turn
the
aircraft
around
and
head
east
The
cockpit
voice
recorder
data
indicate
that
woman
most
likely
flight
attendant
was
being
held
captive
in
the
cockpit
She
struggled
with
one
of
the
hijackers
who
killed
or
otherwise
silenced
her
Shortly
thereafter
the
passengers
and
flight
crew
began
series
of
calls
from
GTE
airphones
and
cellular
phones
These
calls
between
family
friends
and
colleagues
took
place
until
the
end
of
the
flight
and
provided
those
on
the
ground
with
firsthand
accounts
They
enabled
the
passengers
to
gain
critical
information
including
the
news
that
two
aircraft
had
slammed
into
the
World
Trade
Center
At
9:39
the
FAA's
Cleveland
Air
Route
Traffic
Control
Center
overheard
second
announcement
indicating
that
there
was
bomb
on
board
that
the
plane
was
returning
to
the
airport
and
that
they
should
remain
seated
While
it
apparently
was
not
heard
by
the
passengers
this
announcement
like
those
on
Flight
11
and
Flight
77
was
intended
to
deceive
them
Jarrah
like
Atta
earlier
may
have
inadvertently
broadcast
the
message
because
he
did
not
know
how
to
operate
the
radio
and
the
intercom
To
our
knowledge
none
of
them
had
ever
flown
an
actual
airliner
before
At
least
two
callers
from
the
flight
reported
that
the
hijackers
knew
that
passengers
were
making
calls
but
did
not
seem
to
care
It
is
quite
possible
Jarrah
knew
of
the
success
of
the
assault
on
the
World
Trade
Center
He
could
have
learned
of
this
from
messages
being
sent
by
United
Airlines
to
the
cockpits
of
its
transcontinental
flights
including
Flight
93
warning
of
cockpit
intrusion
and
telling
of
the
New
York
attacks
But
even
without
them
he
would
certainly
have
understood
that
the
attacks
on
the
World
Trade
Center
would
already
have
unfolded
given
Flight
93's
tardy
departure
from
Newark
If
Jarrah
did
know
that
the
passengers
were
making
calls
it
might
not
have
occurred
to
him
that
they
were
certain
to
learn
what
had
happened
in
New
York
thereby
defeating
his
attempts
at
deception
At
least
ten
passengers
and
two
crew
members
shared
vital
information
with
family
friends
colleagues
or
others
on
the
ground
All
understood
the
plane
had
been
hijacked
They
said
the
hijackers
wielded
knives
and
claimed
to
have
bomb
The
hijackers
were
wearing
red
bandanas
and
they
forced
the
passengers
to
the
back
of
the
aircraft
Callers
reported
that
passenger
had
been
stabbed
and
that
two
people
were
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
cabin
injured
or
dead-possibly
the
captain
and
first
officer
One
caller
reported
that
flight
attendant
had
been
killed
One
of
the
callers
from
United
93
also
reported
that
he
thought
the
hijackers
might
possess
gun
But
none
of
the
other
callers
reported
the
presence
of
firearm
One
recipient
of
call
from
the
aircraft
recounted
specifically
asking
her
caller
whether
the
hijackers
had
guns
The
passenger
replied
that
he
did
not
see
one
No
evidence
of
firearms
or
of
their
identifiable
remains
was
found
at
the
aircraft's
crash
site
and
the
cockpit
voice
recorder
gives
no
indication
of
gun
being
fired
or
mentioned
at
any
time
We
believe
that
if
the
hijackers
had
possessed
gun
they
would
have
used
it
in
the
flight's
last
minutes
as
the
passengers
fought
back
Passengers
on
three
flights
reported
the
hijackers'
claim
of
having
bomb
The
FBI
told
us
they
found
no
trace
of
explosives
at
the
crash
sites
One
of
the
passengers
who
mentioned
bomb
expressed
his
belief
that
it
was
not
real
Lacking
any
evidence
that
the
hijackers
attempted
to
smuggle
such
illegal
items
past
the
security
screening
checkpoints
we
believe
the
bombs
were
probably
fake
During
at
least
five
of
the
passengers'
phone
calls
information
was
shared
about
the
attacks
that
had
occurred
earlier
that
morning
at
the
World
Trade
Center
Five
calls
described
the
intent
of
passengers
and
surviving
crew
members
to
revolt
against
the
hijackers
According
to
one
call
they
voted
on
whether
to
rush
the
terrorists
in
an
attempt
to
retake
the
plane
They
decided
and
acted
At
9:57
the
passenger
assault
began
Several
passengers
had
terminated
phone
calls
with
loved
ones
in
order
to
join
the
revolt
One
of
the
callers
ended
her
message
as
follows:"Everyone's
running
up
to
first
class
I've
got
to
go
Bye."
The
cockpit
voice
recorder
captured
the
sounds
of
the
passenger
assault
muffled
by
the
intervening
cockpit
door
Some
family
members
who
listened
to
the
recording
report
that
they
can
hear
the
voice
of
loved
one
among
the
din
We
cannot
identify
whose
voices
can
be
heard
But
the
assault
was
sustained
In
response
Jarrah
immediately
began
to
roll
the
airplane
to
the
left
and
right
attempting
to
knock
the
passengers
off
balance
At
9:58:57
Jarrah
told
another
hijacker
in
the
cockpit
to
block
the
door
Jarrah
continued
to
roll
the
airplane
sharply
left
and
right
but
the
assault
continued
At
9:59:52
Jarrah
changed
tactics
and
pitched
the
nose
of
the
airplane
up
and
down
to
disrupt
the
assault
The
recorder
captured
the
sounds
of
loud
thumps
crashes
shouts
and
breaking
glasses
and
plates
At
10:00:03
Jarrah
stabilized
the
airplane
Five
seconds
later
Jarrah
asked
"Is
that
it?
Shall
we
finish
it
off?"A
hijacker
responded,"No
Not
yet
When
they
all
come
we
finish
it
off."
The
sounds
of
fighting
continued
outside
the
cockpit
Again
Jarrah
pitched
the
nose
of
the
aircraft
up
and
down
At
10:00:26
passenger
in
the
background
said,"In
the
cockpit
If
we
don't
we'll
die!"
Sixteen
seconds
later
passenger
yelled,"Roll
it!"
Jarrah
stopped
the
violent
maneuvers
at
about
10:01:00
and
said,"Allah
is
the
greatest!
Allah
is
the
greatest!"
He
then
asked
another
hijacker
in
the
cockpit,"
Is
that
it?
mean
shall
we
put
it
down?"
to
which
the
other
replied,"Yes
put
it
in
it
and
pull
it
down."
The
passengers
continued
their
assault
and
at
10:02:23
hijacker
said
"Pull
it
down!
Pull
it
down!"The
hijackers
remained
at
the
controls
but
must
have
judged
that
the
passengers
were
only
seconds
from
overcoming
them
The
airplane
headed
down;
the
control
wheel
was
turned
hard
to
the
right
The
airplane
rolled
onto
its
back
and
one
of
the
hijackers
began
shouting
"Allah
is
the
greatest
Allah
is
the
greatest."
With
the
sounds
of
the
passenger
counterattack
continuing
the
aircraft
plowed
into
an
empty
field
in
Shanksville
Pennsylvania
at
580
miles
per
hour
about
20
minutes'
flying
time
from
Washington
D.C
Jarrah's
objective
was
to
crash
his
airliner
into
symbols
of
the
American
Republic
the
Capitol
or
the
White
House
He
was
defeated
by
the
alerted
unarmed
passengers

IMPROVISING
HOMELAND
DEFENSE
The
FAA
and
NORAD
On
9/11
the
defense
of
U.S
airspace
depended
on
close
interaction
between
two
federal
agencies:
the
FAA
and
the
North
American
Aerospace
Defense
Command
(NORAD)
The
most
recent
hijacking
that
involved
U.S
air
traffic
controllers
FAA
management
and
military
coordination
had
occurred
in
1993.90
In
order
to
understand
how
the
two
agencies
interacted
eight
years
later
we
will
review
their
missions
command
and
control
structures
and
working
relationship
on
the
morning
of
9/11
FAA
Mission
and
Structure
As
of
September
11
2001
the
FAA
was
mandated
by
law
to
regulate
the
safety
and
security
of
civil
aviation
From
an
air
traffic
controller's
perspective
that
meant
maintaining
safe
distance
between
airborne
aircraft
Many
controllers
work
at
the
FAA's
22
Air
Route
Traffic
Control
Centers
They
are
grouped
under
regional
offices
and
coordinate
closely
with
the
national
Air
Traffic
Control
System
Command
Center
located
in
Herndon
Virginia
which
oversees
daily
traffic
flow
within
the
entire
airspace
system
FAA
headquarters
is
ultimately
responsible
for
the
management
of
the
National
Airspace
System
The
Operations
Center
located
at
FAA
headquarters
receives
notifications
of
incidents
including
accidents
and
hijackings
FAA
Control
Centers
often
receive
information
and
make
operational
decisions
independently
of
one
another
On
9/11
the
four
hijacked
aircraft
were
monitored
mainly
by
the
centers
in
Boston
New
York
Cleveland
and
Indianapolis
Each
center
thus
had
part
of
the
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on
across
the
system
What
Boston
knew
was
not
necessarily
known
by
centers
in
New
York
Cleveland
or
Indianapolis
or
for
that
matter
by
the
Command
Center
in
Herndon
or
by
FAA
headquarters
in
Washington
Controllers
track
airliners
such
as
the
four
aircraft
hijacked
on
9/11
primarily
by
watching
the
data
from
signal
emitted
by
each
aircraft's
transponder
equipment
Those
four
planes
like
all
aircraft
traveling
above
10,000
feet
were
required
to
emit
unique
transponder
signal
while
in
flight
On
9/11
the
terrorists
turned
off
the
transponders
on
three
of
the
four
hijacked
aircraft
With
its
transponder
off
it
is
possible
though
more
difficult
to
track
an
aircraft
by
its
primary
radar
returns
But
unlike
transponder
data
primary
radar
returns
do
not
show
the
aircraft's
identity
and
altitude
Controllers
at
centers
rely
so
heavily
on
transponder
signals
that
they
usually
do
not
display
primary
radar
returns
on
their
radar
scopes
But
they
can
change
the
configuration
of
their
scopes
so
they
can
see
primary
radar
returns
They
did
this
on
9/11
when
the
transponder
signals
for
three
of
the
aircraft
disappeared
Before
9/11
it
was
not
unheard
of
for
commercial
aircraft
to
deviate
slightly
from
its
course
or
for
an
FAA
controller
to
lose
radio
contact
with
pilot
for
short
period
of
time
controller
could
also
briefly
lose
commercial
aircraft's
transponder
signal
although
this
happened
much
less
frequently
However
the
simultaneous
loss
of
radio
and
transponder
signal
would
be
rare
and
alarming
occurrence
and
would
normally
indicate
catastrophic
system
failure
or
an
aircraft
crash
In
all
of
these
instances
the
job
of
the
controller
was
to
reach
out
to
the
aircraft
the
parent
company
of
the
aircraft
and
other
planes
in
the
vicinity
in
an
attempt
to
reestablish
communications
and
set
the
aircraft
back
on
course
Alarm
bells
would
not
start
ringing
until
these
efforts-which
could
take
five
minutes
or
more-were
tried
and
had
failed
NORAD
Mission
and
Structure
NORAD
is
binational
command
established
in
1958
between
the
United
States
and
Canada
Its
mission
was
and
is
to
defend
the
airspace
of
North
America
and
protect
the
continent
That
mission
does
not
distinguish
between
internal
and
external
threats;
but
because
NORAD
was
created
to
counter
the
Soviet
threat
it
came
to
define
its
job
as
defending
against
external
attacks
The
threat
of
Soviet
bombers
diminished
significantly
as
the
Cold
War
ended
and
the
number
of
NORAD
alert
sites
was
reduced
from
its
Cold
War
high
of
26
Some
within
the
Pentagon
argued
in
the
1990s
that
the
alert
sites
should
be
eliminated
entirely
In
an
effort
to
preserve
their
mission
members
of
the
air
defense
community
advocated
the
importance
of
air
sovereignty
against
emerging
"asymmetric
threats"
to
the
United
States:
drug
smuggling
"non-state
and
state-sponsored
terrorists,"
and
the
proliferation
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
ballistic
missile
technology
NORAD
perceived
the
dominant
threat
to
be
from
cruise
missiles
Other
threats
were
identified
during
the
late
1990s
including
terrorists'
use
of
aircraft
as
weapons
Exercises
were
conducted
to
counter
this
threat
but
they
were
not
based
on
actual
intelligence
In
most
instances
the
main
concern
was
the
use
of
such
aircraft
to
deliver
weapons
of
mass
destruction
Prior
to
9/11
it
was
understood
that
an
order
to
shoot
down
commercial
aircraft
would
have
to
be
issued
by
the
National
Command
Authority
(a
phrase
used
to
describe
the
president
and
secretary
of
defense)
Exercise
planners
also
assumed
that
the
aircraft
would
originate
from
outside
the
United
States
allowing
time
to
identify
the
target
and
scramble
interceptors
The
threat
of
terrorists
hijacking
commercial
airliners
within
the
United
States-and
using
them
as
guided
missiles-was
not
recognized
by
NORAD
before
9/11
Notwithstanding
the
identification
of
these
emerging
threats
by
9/11
there
were
only
seven
alert
sites
left
in
the
United
States
each
with
two
fighter
aircraft
on
alert
This
led
some
NORAD
commanders
to
worry
that
NORAD
was
not
postured
adequately
to
protect
the
United
States
In
the
United
States
NORAD
is
divided
into
three
sectors
On
9/11
all
the
hijacked
aircraft
were
in
NORAD's
Northeast
Air
Defense
Sector
(also
known
as
NEADS)
which
is
based
in
Rome
New
York
That
morning
NEADS
could
call
on
two
alert
sites
each
with
one
pair
of
ready
fighters:
Otis
Air
National
Guard
Base
in
Cape
Cod
Massachusetts
and
Langley
Air
Force
Base
in
Hampton
Virginia
Other
facilities
not
on
"alert,"
would
need
time
to
arm
the
fighters
and
organize
crews
NEADS
reported
to
the
Continental
U.S
NORAD
Region
(CONR)
headquarters
in
Panama
City
Florida
which
in
turn
reported
to
NORAD
headquarters
in
Colorado
Springs
Colorado
Interagency
Collaboration
The
FAA
and
NORAD
had
developed
protocols
for
working
together
in
the
event
of
hijacking
As
they
existed
on
9/11
the
protocols
for
the
FAA
to
obtain
military
assistance
from
NORAD
required
multiple
levels
of
notification
and
approval
at
the
highest
levels
of
government
FAA
guidance
to
controllers
on
hijack
procedures
assumed
that
the
aircraft
pilot
would
notify
the
controller
via
radio
or
by"squawking"a
transponder
code
of
"7500"-the
universal
code
for
hijack
in
progress
Controllers
would
notify
their
supervisors
who
in
turn
would
inform
management
all
the
way
up
to
FAA
headquarters
in
Washington
Headquarters
had
hijack
coordinator
who
was
the
director
of
the
FAA
Office
of
Civil
Aviation
Security
or
his
or
her
designate
If
hijack
was
confirmed
procedures
called
for
the
hijack
coordinator
on
duty
to
contact
the
Pentagon's
National
Military
Command
Center
(NMCC)
and
to
ask
for
military
escort
aircraft
to
follow
the
flight
report
anything
unusual
and
aid
search
and
rescue
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
The
NMCC
would
then
seek
approval
from
the
Office
of
the
Secretary
of
Defense
to
provide
military
assistance
If
approval
was
given
the
orders
would
be
transmitted
down
NORAD's
chain
of
command
The
NMCC
would
keep
the
FAA
hijack
coordinator
up
to
date
and
help
the
FAA
centers
coordinate
directly
with
the
military
NORAD
would
receive
tracking
information
for
the
hijacked
aircraft
either
from
joint
use
radar
or
from
the
relevant
FAA
air
traffic
control
facility
Every
attempt
would
be
made
to
have
the
hijacked
aircraft
squawk
7500
to
help
NORAD
track
it
The
protocols
did
not
contemplate
an
intercept
They
assumed
the
fighter
escort
would
be
discreet
"vectored
to
position
five
miles
directly
behind
the
hijacked
aircraft,"
where
it
could
perform
its
mission
to
monitor
the
aircraft's
flight
path
In
sum
the
protocols
in
place
on
9/11
for
the
FAA
and
NORAD
to
respond
to
hijacking
presumed
that
the
hijacked
aircraft
would
be
readily
identifiable
and
would
not
attempt
to
disappear;
there
would
be
time
to
address
the
problem
through
the
appropriate
FAA
and
NORAD
chains
of
command;
and
the
hijacking
would
take
the
traditional
form:
that
is
it
would
not
be
suicide
hijacking
designed
to
convert
the
aircraft
into
guided
missile
On
the
morning
of
9/11
the
existing
protocol
was
unsuited
in
every
respect
for
what
was
about
to
happen
American
Airlines
Flight
11
FAA
Awareness
Although
the
Boston
Center
air
traffic
controller
realized
at
an
early
stage
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
American
11
he
did
not
immediately
interpret
the
plane's
failure
to
respond
as
sign
that
it
had
been
hijacked
At
8:14
when
the
flight
failed
to
heed
his
instruction
to
climb
to
35,000
feet
the
controller
repeatedly
tried
to
raise
the
flight
He
reached
out
to
the
pilot
on
the
emergency
frequency
Though
there
was
no
response
he
kept
trying
to
contact
the
aircraft
At
8:21
American
11
turned
off
its
transponder
immediately
degrading
the
information
available
about
the
aircraft
The
controller
told
his
supervisor
that
he
thought
something
was
seriously
wrong
with
the
plane
although
neither
suspected
hijacking
The
supervisor
instructed
the
controller
to
follow
standard
procedures
for
handling
"no
radio"
aircraft
The
controller
checked
to
see
if
American
Airlines
could
establish
communication
with
American
11
He
became
even
more
concerned
as
its
route
changed
moving
into
another
sector's
airspace
Controllers
immediately
began
to
move
aircraft
out
of
its
path
and
asked
other
aircraft
in
the
vicinity
to
look
for
American
11
At
8:24:38
the
following
transmission
came
from
American
11:
American
11:
We
have
some
planes
Just
stay
quiet
and
you'll
be
okay
We
are
returning
to
the
airport
The
controller
only
heard
something
unintelligible;
he
did
not
hear
the
specific
words
"we
have
some
planes."
The
next
transmission
came
seconds
later:
American
11:
Nobody
move
Everything
will
be
okay
If
you
try
to
make
any
moves
you'll
endanger
yourself
and
the
airplane
Just
stay
quiet
The
controller
told
us
that
he
then
knew
it
was
hijacking
He
alerted
his
supervisor
who
assigned
another
controller
to
assist
him
He
redoubled
his
efforts
to
ascertain
the
flight's
altitude
Because
the
controller
didn't
understand
the
initial
transmission
the
manager
of
Boston
Center
instructed
his
quality
assurance
specialist
to
"pull
the
tape"
of
the
radio
transmission
listen
to
it
closely
and
report
back
Between
8:25
and
8:32
in
accordance
with
the
FAA
protocol
Boston
Center
managers
started
notifying
their
chain
of
command
that
American
11
had
been
hijacked
At
8:28
Boston
Center
called
the
Command
Center
in
Herndon
to
advise
that
it
believed
American
11
had
been
hijacked
and
was
heading
toward
New
York
Center's
airspace
By
this
time
American
11
had
taken
dramatic
turn
to
the
south
At
8:32
the
Command
Center
passed
word
of
possible
hijacking
to
the
Operations
Center
at
FAA
headquarters
The
duty
officer
replied
that
security
personnel
at
headquarters
had
just
begun
discussing
the
apparent
hijack
on
conference
call
with
the
New
England
regional
office
FAA
headquarters
began
to
follow
the
hijack
protocol
but
did
not
contact
the
NMCC
to
request
fighter
escort
The
Herndon
Command
Center
immediately
established
teleconference
between
Boston
New
York
and
Cleveland
Centers
so
that
Boston
Center
could
help
the
others
understand
what
was
happening
At
8:34
the
Boston
Center
controller
received
third
transmission
from
American
11:
American
11:
Nobody
move
please
We
are
going
back
to
the
airport
Don't
try
to
make
any
stupid
moves
In
the
succeeding
minutes
controllers
were
attempting
to
ascertain
the
altitude
of
the
southbound
flight
Military
Notification
and
Response
Boston
Center
did
not
follow
the
protocol
in
seeking
military
assistance
through
the
prescribed
chain
of
command
In
addition
to
notifications
within
the
FAA
Boston
Center
took
the
initiative
at
8:34
to
contact
the
military
through
the
FAA's
Cape
Cod
facility
The
center
also
tried
to
contact
former
alert
site
in
Atlantic
City
unaware
it
had
been
phased
out
At
8:37:52
Boston
Center
reached
NEADS
This
was
the
first
notification
received
by
the
military-at
any
level-that
American
11
had
been
hijacked:
FAA:
Hi
Boston
Center
TMU
[Traffic
Management
Unit]
we
have
problem
here
We
have
hijacked
aircraft
headed
towards
New
York
and
we
need
you
guys
to
we
need
someone
to
scramble
some
F-16s
or
something
up
there
help
us
out
NEADS:
Is
this
real-world
or
exercise?
FAA:
No
this
is
not
an
exercise
not
test
NEADS
ordered
to
battle
stations
the
two
F-15
alert
aircraft
at
Otis
Air
Force
Base
in
Falmouth
Massachusetts
153
miles
away
from
New
York
City
The
air
defense
of
America
began
with
this
call
At
NEADS
the
report
of
the
hijacking
was
relayed
immediately
to
Battle
Commander
Colonel
Robert
Marr
After
ordering
the
Otis
fighters
to
battle
stations
Colonel
Marr
phoned
Major
General
Larry
Arnold
commanding
general
of
the
First
Air
Force
and
NORAD's
Continental
Region
Marr
sought
authorization
to
scramble
the
Otis
fighters
General
Arnold
later
recalled
instructing
Marr
to
"go
ahead
and
scramble
them
and
we'll
get
authorities
later."
General
Arnold
then
called
NORAD
headquarters
to
report
F-15
fighters
were
scrambled
at
8:46
from
Otis
Air
Force
Base
But
NEADS
did
not
know
where
to
send
the
alert
fighter
aircraft
and
the
officer
directing
the
fighters
pressed
for
more
information:"I
don't
know
where
I'm
scrambling
these
guys
to
need
direction
destination."
Because
the
hijackers
had
turned
off
the
plane's
transponder
NEADS
personnel
spent
the
next
minutes
searching
their
radar
scopes
for
the
primary
radar
return
American
11
struck
the
NorthTower
at
8:46
Shortly
after
8:50
while
NEADS
personnel
were
still
trying
to
locate
the
flight
word
reached
them
that
plane
had
hit
the
World
Trade
Center
Radar
data
show
the
Otis
fighters
were
airborne
at
8:53
Lacking
target
they
were
vectored
toward
military-controlled
airspace
off
the
Long
Island
coast
To
avoid
New
York
area
air
traffic
and
uncertain
about
what
to
do
the
fighters
were
brought
down
to
military
airspace
to
"hold
as
needed."
From
9:09
to
9:13
the
Otis
fighters
stayed
in
this
holding
pattern
In
summary
NEADS
received
notice
of
the
hijacking
nine
minutes
before
it
struck
the
North
Tower
That
nine
minutes'
notice
before
impact
was
the
most
the
military
would
receive
of
any
of
the
four
hijackings
United
Airlines
Flight
175
FAA
Awareness
One
of
the
last
transmissions
from
United
Airlines
Flight
175
is
in
retrospect
chilling
By
8:40
controllers
at
the
FAA's
New
York
Center
were
seeking
information
on
American
11
At
approximately
8:42
shortly
after
entering
New
York
Center's
airspace
the
pilot
of
United
175
broke
in
with
the
following
transmission:
UAL
175:
New
York
UAL
175
heavy
FAA:
UAL
175
go
ahead
UAL
175:
Yeah
We
figured
we'd
wait
to
go
to
your
center
Ah
we
heard
suspicious
transmission
on
our
departure
out
of
Boston
ah
with
someone
ah
it
sounded
like
someone
keyed
the
mikes
and
said
ah
everyone
ah
stay
in
your
seats
FAA:
Oh
okay
I'll
pass
that
along
over
here
Minutes
later
United
175
turned
southwest
without
clearance
from
air
traffic
control
At
8:47
seconds
after
the
impact
of
American
11
United
175's
transponder
code
changed
and
then
changed
again
These
changes
were
not
noticed
for
several
minutes
however
because
the
same
New
York
Center
controller
was
assigned
to
both
American
11
and
United
175
The
controller
knew
American
11
was
hijacked;
he
was
focused
on
searching
for
it
after
the
aircraft
disappeared
at
8:46
At
8:48
while
the
controller
was
still
trying
to
locate
American
11
New
York
Center
manager
provided
the
following
report
on
Command
Center
teleconference
about
American
11:
Manager
New
York
Center:
Okay
This
is
New
York
Center
We're
watching
the
airplane
also
had
conversation
with
American
Airlines
and
they've
told
us
that
they
believe
that
one
of
their
stewardesses
was
stabbed
and
that
there
are
people
in
the
cockpit
that
have
control
of
the
aircraft
and
that's
all
the
information
they
have
right
now
The
New
York
Center
controller
and
manager
were
unaware
that
American
11
had
already
crashed
At
8:51
the
controller
noticed
the
transponder
change
from
United
175
and
tried
to
contact
the
aircraft
There
was
no
response
Beginning
at
8:52
the
controller
made
repeated
attempts
to
reach
the
crew
of
United
175
Still
no
response
The
controller
checked
his
radio
equipment
and
contacted
another
controller
at
8:53
saying
that
"we
may
have
hijack"
and
that
he
could
not
find
the
aircraft
Another
commercial
aircraft
in
the
vicinity
then
radioed
in
with
"reports
over
the
radio
of
commuter
plane
hitting
the
World
Trade
Center."
The
controller
spent
the
next
several
minutes
handing
off
the
other
flights
on
his
scope
to
other
controllers
and
moving
aircraft
out
of
the
way
of
the
unidentified
aircraft
(believed
to
be
United
175)
as
it
moved
southwest
and
then
turned
northeast
toward
New
York
City
At
about
8:55
the
controller
in
charge
notified
New
York
Center
manager
that
she
believed
United
175
had
also
been
hijacked
The
manager
tried
to
notify
the
regional
managers
and
was
told
that
they
were
discussing
hijacked
aircraft
(presumably
American
11)
and
refused
to
be
disturbed
At
8:58
the
New
York
Center
controller
searching
for
United
175
told
another
New
York
controller
"we
might
have
hijack
over
here
two
of
them."
Between
9:01
and
9:02
manager
from
New
York
Center
told
the
Command
Center
in
Herndon:
Manager
New
York
Center:
We
have
several
situations
going
on
here
It's
escalating
big
big
time
We
need
to
get
the
military
involved
with
us
We're
we're
involved
with
something
else
we
have
other
aircraft
that
may
have
similar
situation
going
on
here
The
"other
aircraft"
referred
to
by
New
York
Center
was
United
175
Evidence
indicates
that
this
conversation
was
the
only
notice
received
by
either
FAA
headquarters
or
the
Herndon
Command
Center
prior
to
the
second
crash
that
there
had
been
second
hijacking
While
the
Command
Center
was
told
about
this
"other
aircraft"
at
9:01
New
York
Center
contacted
New
York
terminal
approach
control
and
asked
for
help
in
locating
United
175
Terminal:
got
somebody
who
keeps
coasting
but
it
looks
like
he's
going
into
one
of
the
small
airports
down
there
Center:
Hold
on
second
I'm
trying
to
bring
him
up
here
and
get
you-There
he
is
right
there
Hold
on
Terminal:
Got
him
just
out
of
9,500-9,000
now
Center:
Do
you
know
who
he
is?
Terminal:
We're
just
we
just
we
don't
know
who
he
is
We're
just
picking
him
up
now
Center
(at
9:02):
Alright
Heads
up
man
it
looks
like
another
one
coming
in
The
controllers
observed
the
plane
in
rapid
descent;
the
radar
data
terminated
over
Lower
Manhattan
At
9:03
United
175
crashed
into
the
South
Tower
Meanwhile
manager
from
Boston
Center
reported
that
they
had
deciphered
what
they
had
heard
in
one
of
the
first
hijacker
transmissions
from
American
11:
Boston
Center:
Hey
you
still
there?
New
England
Region:
Yes
am
Boston
Center:
as
far
as
the
tape
Bobby
seemed
to
think
the
guy
said
that
"we
have
planes."
Now
don't
know
if
it
was
because
it
was
the
accent
or
if
there's
more
than
one
but
I'm
gonna
I'm
gonna
reconfirm
that
for
you
and
I'll
get
back
to
you
real
quick
Okay?
New
England
Region:
Appreciate
it
Unidentified
Female
Voice:
They
have
what?
Boston
Center:
Planes
as
in
plural
Boston
Center:
It
sounds
like
we're
talking
to
New
York
that
there's
another
one
aimed
at
the
World
Trade
Center
New
England
Region:
There's
another
aircraft?
Boston
Center:
second
one
just
hit
the
Trade
Center
New
England
Region:
Okay
Yeah
we
gotta
get-we
gotta
alert
the
military
real
quick
on
this
Boston
Center
immediately
advised
the
New
England
Region
that
it
was
going
to
stop
all
departures
at
airports
under
its
control
At
9:05
Boston
Center
confirmed
for
both
the
FAA
Command
Center
and
the
New
England
Region
that
the
hijackers
aboard
American
11
said
"we
have
planes."
At
the
same
time
New
York
Center
declared
"ATC
zero"-meaning
that
aircraft
were
not
permitted
to
depart
from
arrive
at
or
travel
through
New
York
Center's
airspace
until
further
notice
Within
minutes
of
the
second
impact
Boston
Center
instructed
its
controllers
to
inform
all
aircraft
in
its
airspace
of
the
events
in
New
York
and
to
advise
aircraft
to
heighten
cockpit
security
Boston
Center
asked
the
Herndon
Command
Center
to
issue
similar
cockpit
security
alert
nationwide
We
have
found
no
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
Command
Center
acted
on
this
request
or
issued
any
type
of
cockpit
security
alert
Military
Notification
and
Response
The
first
indication
that
the
NORAD
air
defenders
had
of
the
second
hijacked
aircraft
United
175
came
in
phone
call
from
New
York
Center
to
NEADS
at
9:03
The
notice
came
at
about
the
time
the
plane
was
hitting
the
South
Tower
By
9:08
the
mission
crew
commander
at
NEADS
learned
of
the
second
explosion
at
the
World
Trade
Center
and
decided
against
holding
the
fighters
in
military
airspace
away
from
Manhattan:
Mission
Crew
Commander
NEADS:
This
is
what
foresee
that
we
probably
need
to
do
We
need
to
talk
to
FAA
We
need
to
tell
'em
if
this
stuff
is
gonna
keep
on
going
we
need
to
take
those
fighters
put
'em
over
Manhattan
That's
best
thing
that's
the
best
play
right
now
So
coordinate
with
the
FAA
Tell
'em
if
there's
more
out
there
which
we
don't
know
let's
get
'em
over
Manhattan
At
least
we
got
some
kind
of
play
The
FAA
cleared
the
airspace
Radar
data
show
that
at
9:13
when
the
Otis
fighters
were
about
115
miles
away
from
the
city
the
fighters
exited
their
holding
pattern
and
set
course
direct
for
Manhattan
They
arrived
at
9:25
and
established
combat
air
patrol
(CAP)
over
the
city
Because
the
Otis
fighters
had
expended
great
deal
of
fuel
in
flying
first
to
military
airspace
and
then
to
New
York
the
battle
commanders
were
concerned
about
refueling
NEADS
considered
scrambling
alert
fighters
from
Langley
Air
Force
Base
in
Virginia
to
New
York
to
provide
backup
The
Langley
fighters
were
placed
on
battle
stations
at
9:09.137
NORAD
had
no
indication
that
any
other
plane
had
been
hijacked
American
Airlines
Flight
77
FAA
Awareness
American
77
began
deviating
from
its
flight
plan
at
8:54
with
slight
turn
toward
the
south
Two
minutes
later
it
disappeared
completely
from
radar
at
Indianapolis
Center
which
was
controlling
the
flight
The
controller
tracking
American
77
told
us
he
noticed
the
aircraft
turning
to
the
southwest
and
then
saw
the
data
disappear
The
controller
looked
for
primary
radar
returns
He
searched
along
the
plane's
projected
flight
path
and
the
airspace
to
the
southwest
where
it
had
started
to
turn
No
primary
targets
appeared
He
tried
the
radios
first
calling
the
aircraft
directly
then
the
airline
Again
there
was
nothing
At
this
point
the
Indianapolis
controller
had
no
knowledge
of
the
situation
in
New
York
He
did
not
know
that
other
aircraft
had
been
hijacked
He
believed
American
77
had
experienced
serious
electrical
or
mechanical
failure
or
both
and
was
gone
Shortly
after
9:00
Indianapolis
Center
started
notifying
other
agencies
that
American
77
was
missing
and
had
possibly
crashed
At
9:08
Indianapolis
Center
asked
Air
Force
Search
and
Rescue
at
Langley
Air
Force
Base
to
look
for
downed
aircraft
The
center
also
contacted
the
West
Virginia
State
Police
and
asked
whether
any
reports
of
downed
aircraft
had
been
received
At
9:09
it
reported
the
loss
of
contact
to
the
FAA
regional
center
which
passed
this
information
to
FAA
headquarters
at
9:24
By
9:20
Indianapolis
Center
learned
that
there
were
other
hijacked
aircraft
and
began
to
doubt
its
initial
assumption
that
American
77
had
crashed
discussion
of
this
concern
between
the
manager
at
Indianapolis
and
the
Command
Center
in
Herndon
prompted
it
to
notify
some
FAA
field
facilities
that
American
77
was
lost
By
9:21
the
Command
Center
some
FAA
field
facilities
and
American
Airlines
had
started
to
search
for
American
77
They
feared
it
had
been
hijacked
At
9:25
the
Command
Center
advised
FAA
headquarters
of
the
situation
The
failure
to
find
primary
radar
return
for
American
77
led
us
to
investigate
this
issue
further
Radar
reconstructions
performed
after
9/11
reveal
that
FAA
radar
equipment
tracked
the
flight
from
the
moment
its
transponder
was
turned
off
at
8:56
But
for
minutes
and
13
seconds
between
8:56
and
9:05
this
primary
radar
information
on
American
77
was
not
displayed
to
controllers
at
Indianapolis
Center
The
reasons
are
technical
arising
from
the
way
the
software
processed
radar
information
as
well
as
from
poor
primary
radar
coverage
where
American
77
was
flying
According
to
the
radar
reconstruction
American
77
reemerged
as
primary
target
on
Indianapolis
Center
radar
scopes
at
9:05
east
of
its
last
known
position
The
target
remained
in
Indianapolis
Center's
airspace
for
another
six
minutes
then
crossed
into
the
western
portion
of
Washington
Center's
airspace
at
9:10
As
Indianapolis
Center
continued
searching
for
the
aircraft
two
managers
and
the
controller
responsible
for
American
77
looked
to
the
west
and
southwest
along
the
flight's
projected
path
not
east-where
the
aircraft
was
now
heading
Managers
did
not
instruct
other
controllers
at
Indianapolis
Center
to
turn
on
their
primary
radar
coverage
to
join
in
the
search
for
American
77
In
sum
Indianapolis
Center
never
saw
Flight
77
turn
around
By
the
time
it
reappeared
in
primary
radar
coverage
controllers
had
either
stopped
looking
for
the
aircraft
because
they
thought
it
had
crashed
or
were
looking
toward
the
west
Although
the
Command
Center
learned
Flight
77
was
missing
neither
it
nor
FAA
headquarters
issued
an
all
points
bulletin
to
surrounding
centers
to
search
for
primary
radar
targets
American
77
traveled
undetected
for
36
minutes
on
course
heading
due
east
for
Washington
D.C
By
9:25
FAA's
Herndon
Command
Center
and
FAA
headquarters
knew
two
aircraft
had
crashed
into
the
World
Trade
Center
They
knew
American
77
was
lost
At
least
some
FAA
officials
in
Boston
Center
and
the
New
England
Region
knew
that
hijacker
on
board
American
11
had
said
"we
have
some
planes."
Concerns
over
the
safety
of
other
aircraft
began
to
mount
manager
at
the
Herndon
Command
Center
asked
FAA
headquarters
if
they
wanted
to
order
"nationwide
ground
stop."
While
this
was
being
discussed
by
executives
at
FAA
headquarters
the
Command
Center
ordered
one
at
9:25
The
Command
Center
kept
looking
for
American
77
At
9:21
it
advised
the
Dulles
terminal
control
facility
and
Dulles
urged
its
controllers
to
look
for
primary
targets
At
9:32
they
found
one
Several
of
the
Dulles
controllers
"observed
primary
radar
target
tracking
eastbound
at
high
rate
of
speed"
and
notified
Reagan
National
Airport
FAA
personnel
at
both
Reagan
National
and
Dulles
airports
notified
the
Secret
Service
The
aircraft's
identity
or
type
was
unknown
Reagan
National
controllers
then
vectored
an
unarmed
National
Guard
C-
130H
cargo
aircraft
which
had
just
taken
off
en
route
to
Minnesota
to
identify
and
follow
the
suspicious
aircraft
The
C-130H
pilot
spotted
it
identified
it
as
Boeing
757
attempted
to
follow
its
path
and
at
9:38
seconds
after
impact
reported
to
the
control
tower:"looks
like
that
aircraft
crashed
into
the
Pentagon
sir."
Military
Notification
and

NORAD
heard
nothing
about
the

Instead
the
NEADS

heard
renewed

no
longer
existed:
American

At
9:21
NEADS
received

American
11
is
still
in
the
air
and
it's
on
its
way
towards-heading
towards
Washington
NEADS:
Okay
American
11
is
still
in
the
air?
FAA:
Yes
NEADS:
On
its
way
towards
Washington?
FAA:
That
was
another-it
was
evidently
another
aircraft
that
hit
the
tower
That's
the
latest
report
we
have
NEADS:
Okay
FAA:
I'm
going
to
try
to
confirm
an
ID
for
you
but
would
assume
he's
somewhere
over
uh
either
New
Jersey
or
somewhere
further
south
NEADS:
Okay
So
American
11
isn't
the
hijack
at
all
then
right?
FAA:
No
he
is
hijack
NEADS:
He-American
11
is
hijack?
FAA:
Yes
NEADS:
And
he's
heading
into
Washington?
FAA:
Yes
This
could
be
third
aircraft
The
mention
of
"third
aircraft"
was
not
reference
to
American
77
There
was
confusion
at
that
moment
in
the
FAA
Two
planes
had
struck
the
World
Trade
Center
and
Boston
Center
had
heard
from
FAA
headquarters
in
Washington
that
American
11
was
still
airborne
We
have
been
unable
to
identify
the
source
of
this
mistaken
FAA
information
The
NEADS
technician
who
took
this
call
from
the
FAA
immediately
passed
the
word
to
the
mission
crew
commander
who
reported
to
the
NEADS
battle
commander:
Mission
Crew
Commander
NEADS:
Okay
uh
American
Airlines
is
still
airborne
Eleven
the
first
guy
he's
heading
towards
Washington
Okay?
think
we
need
to
scramble
Langley
right
now
And
I'm
gonna
take
the
fighters
from
Otis
try
to
chase
this
guy
down
if
can
find
him
After
consulting
with
NEADS
command
the
crew
commander
issued
the
order
at
9:23:"Okay
scramble
Langley
Head
them
towards
the
Washington
area
[I]f
they're
there
then
we'll
run
on
them
These
guys
are
smart."
That
order
was
processed
and
transmitted
to
Langley
Air
Force
Base
at
9:24
Radar
data
show
the
Langley
fighters
airborne
at
9:30
NEADS
decided
to
keep
the
Otis
fighters
over
New
York
The
heading
of
the
Langley
fighters
was
adjusted
to
send
them
to
the
Baltimore
area
The
mission
crew
commander
explained
to
us
that
the
purpose
was
to
position
the
Langley
fighters
between
the
reported
southbound
American
11
and
the
nation's
capital
At
the
suggestion
of
the
Boston
Center's
military
liaison
NEADS
contacted
the
FAA's
Washington
Center
to
ask
about
American
11
In
the
course
of
the
conversation
Washington
Center
manager
informed
NEADS:"We're
looking-
we
also
lost
American
77."
The
time
was
9:34
This
was
the
first
notice
to
the
military
that
American
77
was
missing
and
it
had
come
by
chance
If
NEADS
had
not
placed
that
call
the
NEADS
air
defenders
would
have
received
no
information
whatsoever
that
the
flight
was
even
missing
although
the
FAA
had
been
searching
for
it
No
one
at
FAA
headquarters
ever
asked
for
military
assistance
with
American
77
At
9:36
the
FAA's
Boston
Center
called
NEADS
and
relayed
the
discovery
about
an
unidentified
aircraft
closing
in
on
Washington:"Latest
report
Aircraft
VFR
[visual
flight
rules]
six
miles
southeast
of
the
White
House
Six
southwest
Six
southwest
of
the
White
House
deviating
away."
This
startling
news
prompted
the
mission
crew
commander
at
NEADS
to
take
immediate
control
of
the
airspace
to
clear
flight
path
for
the
Langley
fighters:"Okay
we're
going
to
turn
it
crank
it
up
Run
them
to
the
White
House."
He
then
discovered
to
his
surprise
that
the
Langley
fighters
were
not
headed
north
toward
the
Baltimore
area
as
instructed
but
east
over
the
ocean."
don't
care
how
many
windows
you
break,"
he
said."
Damn
it
Okay
Push
them
back."
The
Langley
fighters
were
heading
east
not
north
for
three
reasons
First
unlike
normal
scramble
order
this
order
did
not
include
distance
to
the
target
or
the
target's
location
Second
"generic"
flight
plan-prepared
to
get
the
aircraft
airborne
and
out
of
local
airspace
quickly-incorrectly
led
the
Langley
fighters
to
believe
they
were
ordered
to
fly
due
east
(090)
for
60
miles
Third
the
lead
pilot
and
local
FAA
controller
incorrectly
assumed
the
flight
plan
instruction
to
go
"090
for
60"
superseded
the
original
scramble
order
After
the
9:36
call
to
NEADS
about
the
unidentified
aircraft
few
miles
from
the
White
House
the
Langley
fighters
were
ordered
to
Washington
D.C
Controllers
at
NEADS
located
an
unknown
primary
radar
track
but
"it
kind
of
faded"
over
Washington
The
time
was
9:38
The
Pentagon
had
been
struck
by
American
77
at
9:37:46
The
Langley
fighters
were
about
150
miles
away
Right
after
the
Pentagon
was
hit
NEADS
learned
of
another
possible
hijacked
aircraft
It
was
an
aircraft
that
in
fact
had
not
been
hijacked
at
all
After
the
second
World
Trade
Center
crash
Boston
Center
managers
recognized
that
both
aircraft
were
transcontinental
767
jetliners
that
had
departed
Logan
Airport
Remembering
the
"we
have
some
planes"
remark
Boston
Center
guessed
that
Delta
1989
might
also
be
hijacked
Boston
Center
called
NEADS
at
9:41
and
identified
Delta
1989
767
jet
that
had
left
Logan
Airport
for
Las
Vegas
as
possible
hijack
NEADS
warned
the
FAA's
Cleveland
Center
to
watch
Delta
1989
The
Command
Center
and
FAA
headquarters
watched
it
too
During
the
course
of
the
morning
there
were
multiple
erroneous
reports
of
hijacked
aircraft
The
report
of
American
11
heading
south
was
the
first;
Delta
1989
was
the
second
NEADS
never
lost
track
of
Delta
1989
and
even
ordered
fighter
aircraft
from
Ohio
and
Michigan
to
intercept
it
The
flight
never
turned
off
its
transponder
NEADS
soon
learned
that
the
aircraft
was
not
hijacked
and
tracked
Delta
1989
as
it
reversed
course
over
Toledo
headed
east
and
landed
in
Cleveland
But
another
aircraft
was
heading
toward
Washington
an
aircraft
about
which
NORAD
had
heard
nothing:
United
93
United
Airlines
Flight
93
FAA
Awareness
At
9:27
after
having
been
in
the
air
for
45
minutes
United
93
acknowledged
transmission
from
the
Cleveland
Center
controller
This
was
the
last
normal
contact
the
FAA
had
with
the
flight
Less
than
minute
later
the
Cleveland
controller
and
the
pilots
of
aircraft
in
the
vicinity
heard
"a
radio
transmission
of
unintelligible
sounds
of
possible
screaming
or
struggle
from
an
unknown
origin."
The
controller
responded
seconds
later:
"Somebody
call
Cleveland?"This
was
followed
by
second
radio
transmission
with
sounds
of
screaming
The
Cleveland
Center
controllers
began
to
try
to
identify
the
possible
source
of
the
transmissions
and
noticed
that
United
93
had
descended
some
700
feet
The
controller
attempted
again
to
raise
United
93
several
times
with
no
response
At
9:30
the
controller
began
to
poll
the
other
flights
on
his
frequency
to
determine
if
they
had
heard
the
screaming;
several
said
they
had
At
9:32
third
radio
transmission
came
over
the
frequency:"Keep
remaining
sitting
We
have
bomb
on
board."
The
controller
understood
but
chose
to
respond:
"Calling
Cleveland
Center
you're
unreadable
Say
again
slowly."
He
notified
his
supervisor
who
passed
the
notice
up
the
chain
of
command
By
9:34
word
of
the
hijacking
had
reached
FAA
headquarters
FAA
headquarters
had
by
this
time
established
an
open
line
of
communication
with
the
Command
Center
at
Herndon
and
instructed
it
to
poll
all
its
centers
about
suspect
aircraft
The
Command
Center
executed
the
request
and
minute
later
Cleveland
Center
reported
that
"United
93
may
have
bomb
on
board."
At
9:34
the
Command
Center
relayed
the
information
concerning
United
93
to
FAA
headquarters
At
approximately
9:36
Cleveland
advised
the
Command
Center
that
it
was
still
tracking
United
93
and
specifically
inquired
whether
someone
had
requested
the
military
to
launch
fighter
aircraft
to
intercept
the
aircraft
Cleveland
even
told
the
Command
Center
it
was
prepared
to
contact
nearby
military
base
to
make
the
request
The
Command
Center
told
Cleveland
that
FAA
personnel
well
above
them
in
the
chain
of
command
had
to
make
the
decision
to
seek
military
assistance
and
were
working
on
the
issue
Between
9:34
and
9:38
the
Cleveland
controller
observed
United
93
climbing
to
40,700
feet
and
immediately
moved
several
aircraft
out
its
way
The
controller
continued
to
try
to
contact
United
93
and
asked
whether
the
pilot
could
confirm
that
he
had
been
hijacked
There
was
no
response
Then
at
9:39
fourth
radio
transmission
was
heard
from
United
93:
Ziad
Jarrah:
Uh
this
is
the
captain
Would
like
you
all
to
remain
seated
There
is
bomb
on
board
and
are
going
back
to
the
airport
and
to
have
our
demands
[unintelligible]
Please
remain
quiet
The
controller
responded:
"United
93
understand
you
have
bomb
on
board
Go
ahead."
The
flight
did
not
respond
From
9:34
to
10:08
Command
Center
facility
manager
provided
frequent
updates
to
Acting
Deputy
Administrator
Monte
Belger
and
other
executives
at
FAA
headquarters
as
United
93
headed
toward
Washington
D.C
At
9:41
Cleveland
Center
lost
United
93's
transponder
signal
The
controller
located
it
on
primary
radar
matched
its
position
with
visual
sightings
from
other
aircraft
and
tracked
the
flight
as
it
turned
east
then
south
At
9:42
the
Command
Center
learned
from
news
reports
that
plane
had
struck
the
Pentagon
The
Command
Center's
national
operations
manager
Ben
Sliney
ordered
all
FAA
facilities
to
instruct
all
aircraft
to
land
at
the
nearest
airport
This
was
an
unprecedented
order
The
air
traffic
control
system
handled
it
with
great
skill
as
about
4,500
commercial
and
general
aviation
aircraft
soon
landed
without
incident
At
9:46
the
Command
Center
updated
FAA
headquarters
that
United
93
was
now
"twenty-nine
minutes
out
of
Washington
D.C."
At
9:49
13
minutes
after
Cleveland
Center
had
asked
about
getting
military
help
the
Command
Center
suggested
that
someone
at
headquarters
should
decide
whether
to
request
military
assistance:
FAA
Headquarters:
They're
pulling
Jeff
away
to
go
talk
about
United
93
Command
Center:
Uh
do
we
want
to
think
uh
about
scrambling
aircraft?
FAA
Headquarters:
Oh
God
don't
know
Command
Center:
Uh
that's
decision
somebody's
gonna
have
to
make
probably
in
the
next
ten
minutes
FAA
Headquarters:
Uh
ya
know
everybody
just
left
the
room
At
9:53
FAA
headquarters
informed
the
Command
Center
that
the
deputy
director
for
air
traffic
services
was
talking
to
Monte
Belger
about
scrambling
aircraft
Then
the
Command
Center
informed
headquarters
that
controllers
had
lost
track
of
United
93
over
the
Pittsburgh
area
Within
seconds
the
Command
Center
received
visual
report
from
another
aircraft
and
informed
headquarters
that
the
aircraft
was
20
miles
northwest
of
Johnstown
United
93
was
spotted
by
another
aircraft
and
at
10:01
the
Command
Center
advised
FAA
headquarters
that
one
of
the
aircraft
had
seen
United
93
"waving
his
wings."
The
aircraft
had
witnessed
the
hijackers'
efforts
to
defeat
the
passengers'
counterattack
United
93
crashed
in
Pennsylvania
at
10:03:11
125
miles
from
Washington
D.C
The
precise
crash
time
has
been
the
subject
of
some
dispute
The
10:03:11
impact
time
is
supported
by
previous
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
analysis
and
by
evidence
from
the
Commission
staff
's
analysis
of
radar
the
flight
data
recorder
the
cockpit
voice
recorder
infrared
satellite
data
and
air
traffic
control
transmissions
Five
minutes
later
the
Command
Center
forwarded
this
update
to
headquarters:
Command
Center:
O.K
Uh
there
is
now
on
that
United
93
FAA
Headquarters:
Yes
Command
Center:
There
is
report
of
black
smoke
in
the
last
position
gave
you
fifteen
miles
south
of
Johnstown
FAA
Headquarters:
From
the
airplane
or
from
the
ground?
Command
Center:
Uh
they're
speculating
it's
from
the
aircraft
FAA
Headquarters:
Okay
Command
Center:
Uh
who
it
hit
the
ground
That's
what
they're
speculating
that's
speculation
only
The
aircraft
that
spotted
the
"black
smoke"
was
the
same
unarmed
Air
National
Guard
cargo
plane
that
had
seen
American
77
crash
into
the
Pentagon
27
minutes
earlier
It
had
resumed
its
flight
to
Minnesota
and
saw
the
smoke
from
the
crash
of
United
93
less
than
two
minutes
after
the
plane
went
down
At
10:17
the
Command
Center
advised
headquarters
of
its
conclusion
that
United
93
had
indeed
crashed
Despite
the
discussions
about
military
assistance
no
one
from
FAA
headquarters
requested
military
assistance
regarding
United
93
Nor
did
any
manager
at
FAA
headquarters
pass
any
of
the
information
it
had
about
United
93
to
the
military
Military
Notification
and
Response
NEADS
first
received
call
about
United
93
from
the
military
liaison
at
Cleveland
Center
at
10:07
Unaware
that
the
aircraft
had
already
crashed
Cleveland
passed
to
NEADS
the
aircraft's
last
known
latitude
and
longitude
NEADS
was
never
able
to
locate
United
93
on
radar
because
it
was
already
in
the
ground
At
the
same
time
the
NEADS
mission
crew
commander
was
dealing
with
the
arrival
of
the
Langley
fighters
over
Washington
D.C.
sorting
out
what
their
orders
were
with
respect
to
potential
targets
Shortly
after
10:10
and
having
no
knowledge
either
that
United
93
had
been
heading
toward
Washington
or
that
it
had
crashed
he
explicitly
instructed
the
Langley
fighters:
"negative-
negative
clearance
to
shoot"
aircraft
over
the
nation's
capital
The
news
of
reported
bomb
on
board
United
93
spread
quickly
at
NEADS
The
air
defenders
searched
for
United
93's
primary
radar
return
and
tried
to
locate
other
fighters
to
scramble
NEADS
called
Washington
Center
to
report:
NEADS:
also
want
to
give
you
heads-up
Washington
FAA
(DC):
Go
ahead
NEADS:
United
nine
three
have
you
got
information
on
that
yet?
FAA:
Yeah
he's
down
NEADS:
He's
down?
FAA:
Yes
NEADS:
When
did
he
land?
'Cause
we
have
got
confirmation-
FAA:
He
did
not
land
NEADS:
Oh
he's
down?
Down?
FAA:
Yes
Somewhere
up
northeast
of
Camp
David
NEADS:
Northeast
of
Camp
David
FAA:
That's
the
last
report
They
don't
know
exactly
where
The
time
of
notification
of
the
crash
of
United
93
was
10:15
The
NEADS
air
defenders
never
located
the
flight
or
followed
it
on
their
radar
scopes
The
flight
had
already
crashed
by
the
time
they
learned
it
was
hijacked
Clarifying
the
Record
The
defense
of
U.S
airspace
on
9/11
was
not
conducted
in
accord
with
preexisting
training
and
protocols
It
was
improvised
by
civilians
who
had
never
handled
hijacked
aircraft
that
attempted
to
disappear
and
by
military
unprepared
for
the
transformation
of
commercial
aircraft
into
weapons
of
mass
destruction
As
it
turned
out
the
NEADS
air
defenders
had
nine
minutes'
notice
on
the
first
hijacked
plane
no
advance
notice
on
the
second
no
advance
notice
on
the
third
and
no
advance
notice
on
the
fourth
We
do
not
believe
that
the
true
picture
of
that
morning
reflects
discredit
on
the
operational
personnel
at
NEADS
or
FAA
facilities
NEADS
commanders
and
officers
actively
sought
out
information
and
made
the
best
judgments
they
could
on
the
basis
of
what
they
knew
Individual
FAA
controllers
facility
managers
and
Command
Center
managers
thought
outside
the
box
in
recommending
nationwide
alert
in
ground-stopping
local
traffic
and
ultimately
in
deciding
to
land
all
aircraft
and
executing
that
unprecedented
order
flawlessly
More
than
the
actual
events
inaccurate
government
accounts
of
those
events
made
it
appear
that
the
military
was
notified
in
time
to
respond
to
two
of
the
hijackings
raising
questions
about
the
adequacy
of
the
response
Those
accounts
had
the
effect
of
deflecting
questions
about
the
military's
capacity
to
obtain
timely
and
accurate
information
from
its
own
sources
In
addition
they
overstated
the
FAA's
ability
to
provide
the
military
with
timely
and
useful
information
that
morning
In
public
testimony
before
this
Commission
in
May
2003
NORAD
officials
stated
that
at
9:16
NEADS
received
hijack
notification
of
United
93
from
the
FAA
This
statement
was
incorrect
There
was
no
hijack
to
report
at
9:16
United
93
was
proceeding
normally
at
that
time
In
this
same
public
testimony
NORAD
officials
stated
that
at
9:24
NEADS
received
notification
of
the
hijacking
of
American
77
This
statement
was
also
incorrect
The
notice
NEADS
received
at
9:24
was
that
American
11
had
not
hit
the
World
Trade
Center
and
was
heading
for
Washington
D.C
In
their
testimony
and
in
other
public
accounts
NORAD
officials
also
stated
that
the
Langley
fighters
were
scrambled
to
respond
to
the
notifications
about
American
77,178
United
93
or
both
These
statements
were
incorrect
as
well
The
fighters
were
scrambled
because
of
the
report
that
American
11
was
heading
south
as
is
clear
not
just
from
taped
conversations
at
NEADS
but
also
from
taped
conversations
at
FAA
centers;
contemporaneous
logs
compiled
at
NEADS
Continental
Region
headquarters
and
NORAD;
and
other
records
Yet
this
response
to
phantom
aircraft
was
not
recounted
in
single
public
timeline
or
statement
issued
by
the
FAA
or
Department
of
Defense
The
inaccurate
accounts
created
the
impression
that
the
Langley
scramble
was
logical
response
to
an
actual
hijacked
aircraft
In
fact
not
only
was
the
scramble
prompted
by
the
mistaken
information
about
American
11
but
NEADS
never
received
notice
that
American
77
was
hijacked
It
was
notified
at
9:34
that
American
77
was
lost
Then
minutes
later
NEADS
was
told
that
an
unknown
plane
was
miles
southwest
of
the
White
House
Only
then
did
the
already
scrambled
airplanes
start
moving
directly
toward
Washington
D.C
Thus
the
military
did
not
have
14
minutes
to
respond
to
American
77
as
testimony
to
the
Commission
in
May
2003
suggested
It
had
at
most
one
or
two
minutes
to
react
to
the
unidentified
plane
approaching
Washington
and
the
fighters
were
in
the
wrong
place
to
be
able
to
help
They
had
been
responding
to
report
about
an
aircraft
that
did
not
exist
Nor
did
the
military
have
47
minutes
to
respond
to
United
93
as
would
be
implied
by
the
account
that
it
received
notice
of
the
flight's
hijacking
at
9:16
By
the
time
the
military
learned
about
the
flight
it
had
crashed
We
now
turn
to
the
role
of
national
leadership
in
the
events
that
morning
NATIONAL
CRISIS
MANAGEMENT
When
American
11
struck
the
World
Trade
Center
at
8:46
no
one
in
the
White
House
or
traveling
with
the
President
knew
that
it
had
been
hijacked
While
that
information
circulated
within
the
FAA
we
found
no
evidence
that
the
hijacking
was
reported
to
any
other
agency
in
Washington
before
8:46
Most
federal
agencies
learned
about
the
crash
in
New
York
from
CNN
Within
the
FAA
the
administrator
Jane
Garvey
and
her
acting
deputy
Monte
Belger
had
not
been
told
of
confirmed
hijacking
before
they
learned
from
television
that
plane
had
crashed
Others
in
the
agency
were
aware
of
it
as
we
explained
earlier
in
this
chapter
Inside
the
National
Military
Command
Center
the
deputy
director
of
operations
and
his
assistant
began
notifying
senior
Pentagon
officials
of
the
incident
At
about
9:00
the
senior
NMCC
operations
officer
reached
out
to
the
FAA
operations
center
for
information
Although
the
NMCC
was
advised
of
the
hijacking
of
American
11
the
scrambling
of
jets
was
not
discussed
In
Sarasota
Florida
the
presidential
motorcade
was
arriving
at
the
Emma
E
Booker
Elementary
School
where
President
Bush
was
to
read
to
class
and
talk
about
education
White
House
Chief
of
Staff
Andrew
Card
told
us
he
was
standing
with
the
President
outside
the
classroom
when
Senior
Advisor
to
the
President
Karl
Rove
first
informed
them
that
small
twin-engine
plane
had
crashed
into
the
World
Trade
Center
The
President's
reaction
was
that
the
incident
must
have
been
caused
by
pilot
error
At
8:55
before
entering
the
classroom
the
President
spoke
to
National
Security
Advisor
Condoleezza
Rice
who
was
at
the
White
House
She
recalled
first
telling
the
President
it
was
twin-engine
aircraft-and
then
commercial
aircraft-that
had
struck
the
World
Trade
Center
adding
"that's
all
we
know
right
now
Mr
President."
At
the
White
House
Vice
President
Dick
Cheney
had
just
sat
down
for
meeting
when
his
assistant
told
him
to
turn
on
his
television
because
plane
had
struck
the
NorthTower
of
the
World
Trade
Center
The
Vice
President
was
wondering
"how
the
hell
could
plane
hit
the
World
Trade
Center"
when
he
saw
the
second
aircraft
strike
the
South
Tower
Elsewhere
in
the
White
House
series
of
9:00
meetings
was
about
to
begin
In
the
absence
of
information
that
the
crash
was
anything
other
than
an
accident
the
White
House
staff
monitored
the
news
as
they
went
ahead
with
their
regular
schedules
The
Agencies
Confer
When
they
learned
second
plane
had
struck
the
World
Trade
Center
nearly
everyone
in
the
White
House
told
us
they
immediately
knew
it
was
not
an
accident
The
Secret
Service
initiated
number
of
security
enhancements
around
the
White
House
complex
The
officials
who
issued
these
orders
did
not
know
that
there
were
additional
hijacked
aircraft
or
that
one
such
aircraft
was
en
route
to
Washington
These
measures
were
precautionary
steps
taken
because
of
the
strikes
in
New
York
The
FAA
and
White
House
Teleconferences
The
FAA
the
White
House
and
the
Defense
Department
each
initiated
multiagency
teleconference
before
9:30
Because
none
of
these
teleconferences-at
least
before
10:00-
included
the
right
officials
from
both
the
FAA
and
Defense
Department
none
succeeded
in
meaningfully
coordinating
the
military
and
FAA
response
to
the
hijackings
At
about
9:20
security
personnel
at
FAA
headquarters
set
up
hijacking
teleconference
with
several
agencies
including
the
Defense
Department
The
NMCC
officer
who
participated
told
us
that
the
call
was
monitored
only
periodically
because
the
information
was
sporadic
it
was
of
little
value
and
there
were
other
important
tasks
The
FAA
manager
of
the
teleconference
also
remembered
that
the
military
participated
only
briefly
before
the
Pentagon
was
hit
Both
individuals
agreed
that
the
teleconference
played
no
role
in
coordinating
response
to
the
attacks
of
9/11
Acting
Deputy
Administrator
Belger
was
frustrated
to
learn
later
in
the
morning
that
the
military
had
not
been
on
the
call
At
the
White
House
the
video
teleconference
was
conducted
from
the
Situation
Room
by
Richard
Clarke
special
assistant
to
the
president
long
involved
in
counterterrorism
Logs
indicate
that
it
began
at
9:25
and
included
the
CIA;
the
FBI;
the
departments
of
State
Justice
and
Defense;
the
FAA;
and
the
White
House
shelter
The
FAA
and
CIA
joined
at
9:40
The
first
topic
addressed
in
the
White
House
video
teleconference-at
about
9:40-was
the
physical
security
of
the
President
the
White
House
and
federal
agencies
Immediately
thereafter
it
was
reported
that
plane
had
hit
the
Pentagon
We
found
no
evidence
that
video
teleconference
participants
had
any
prior
information
that
American
77
had
been
hijacked
and
was
heading
directly
toward
Washington
Indeed
it
is
not
clear
to
us
that
the
video
teleconference
was
fully
under
way
before
9:37
when
the
Pentagon
was
struck
Garvey
Belger
and
other
senior
officials
from
FAA
headquarters
participated
in
this
video
teleconference
at
various
times
We
do
not
know
who
from
Defense
participated
but
we
know
that
in
the
first
hour
none
of
the
personnel
involved
in
managing
the
crisis
did
And
none
of
the
information
conveyed
in
the
White
House
video
teleconference
at
least
in
the
first
hour
was
being
passed
to
the
NMCC
As
one
witness
recalled
"[It]
was
almost
like
there
were
parallel
decisionmaking
processes
going
on;
one
was
voice
conference
orchestrated
by
the
NMCC
and
then
there
was
the
[White
House
video
teleconference]
[I]n
my
mind
they
were
competing
venues
for
command
and
control
and
decisionmaking."
At
10:03
the
conference
received
reports
of
more
missing
aircraft
"2
possibly
aloft,"
and
learned
of
combat
air
patrol
over
Washington
There
was
discussion
of
the
need
for
rules
of
engagement
Clarke
reported
that
they
were
asking
the
President
for
authority
to
shoot
down
aircraft
Confirmation
of
that
authority
came
at
10:25
but
the
commands
were
already
being
conveyed
in
more
direct
contacts
with
the
Pentagon
The
Pentagon
Teleconferences
Inside
the
National
Military
Command
Center
the
deputy
director
for
operations
immediately
thought
the
second
strike
was
terrorist
attack
The
job
of
the
NMCC
in
such
an
emergency
is
to
gather
the
relevant
parties
and
establish
the
chain
of
command
between
the
National
Command
Authority-the
president
and
the
secretary
of
defense-
and
those
who
need
to
carry
out
their
orders
On
the
morning
of
September
11
Secretary
Rumsfeld
was
having
breakfast
at
the
Pentagon
with
group
of
members
of
Congress
He
then
returned
to
his
office
for
his
daily
intelligence
briefing
The
Secretary
was
informed
of
the
second
strike
in
New
York
during
the
briefing;
he
resumed
the
briefing
while
awaiting
more
information
After
the
Pentagon
was
struck
Secretary
Rumsfeld
went
to
the
parking
lot
to
assist
with
rescue
efforts
Inside
the
NMCC
the
deputy
director
for
operations
called
for
an
allpurpose
"significant
event"
conference
It
began
at
9:29
with
brief
recap:
two
aircraft
had
struck
the
World
Trade
Center
there
was
confirmed
hijacking
of
American
11
and
Otis
fighters
had
been
scrambled
The
FAA
was
asked
to
provide
an
update
but
the
line
was
silent
because
the
FAA
had
not
been
added
to
the
call
minute
later
the
deputy
director
stated
that
it
had
just
been
confirmed
that
American
11
was
still
airborne
and
heading
toward
D.C
He
directed
the
transition
to
an
air
threat
conference
call
NORAD
confirmed
that
American
11
was
airborne
and
heading
toward
Washington
relaying
the
erroneous
FAA
information
already
mentioned
The
call
then
ended
at
about
9:34
It
resumed
at
9:37
as
an
air
threat
conference
call,*
which
lasted
more
than
eight
hours
The
President
Vice
President
Secretary
of
Defense
Vice
Chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
and
Deputy
National
Security
Advisor
Stephen
Hadley
all
participated
in
this
teleconference
at
various
times
as
did
military
personnel
from
the
White
House
underground
shelter
and
the
President's
military
aide
on
Air
Force
One
Operators
worked
feverishly
to
include
the
FAA
but
they
had
equipment
problems
and
difficulty
finding
secure
phone
numbers
NORAD
asked
three
times
before
10:03
to
confirm
the
presence
of
the
FAA
in
the
teleconference
The
FAA
representative
who
finally
joined
the
call
at
10:17
had
no
familiarity
with
or
responsibility
for
hijackings
no
access
to
decisionmakers
and
none
of
the
information
available
to
senior
FAA
officials
All
times
given
for
this
conference
call
are
estimates
which
we
and
the
Department
of
Defense
believe
to
be
accurate
within
minute
margin
of
error
We
found
no
evidence
that
at
this
critical
time
NORAD's
top
commanders
in
Florida
or
Cheyenne
Mountain
coordinated
with
their
counterparts
at
FAA
headquarters
to
improve
awareness
and
organize
common
response
Lower-level
officials
improvised-for
example
the
FAA's
Boston
Center
bypassed
the
chain
of
command
and
directly
contacted
NEADS
after
the
first
hijacking
But
the
highest-level
Defense
Department
officials
relied
on
the
NMCC's
air
threat
conference
in
which
the
FAA
did
not
participate
for
the
first
48
minutes
At
9:39
the
NMCC's
deputy
director
for
operations
military
officer
opened
the
call
from
the
Pentagon
which
had
just
been
hit
He
began:"An
air
attack
against
North
America
may
be
in
progress
NORAD
what's
the
situation?"
NORAD
said
it
had
conflicting
reports
Its
latest
information
was
"of
possible
hijacked
aircraft
taking
off
out
of
JFK
en
route
to
Washington
D.C."
The
NMCC
reported
crash
into
the
mall
side
of
the
Pentagon
and
requested
that
the
Secretary
of
Defense
be
added
to
the
conference
At
9:44
NORAD
briefed
the
conference
on
the
possible
hijacking
of
Delta
1989
Two
minutes
later
staff
reported
that
they
were
still
trying
to
locate
Secretary
Rumsfeld
and
Vice
Chairman
Myers
The
Vice
Chairman
joined
the
conference
shortly
before
10:00;
the
Secretary
shortly
before
10:30
The
Chairman
was
out
of
the
country
At
9:48
representative
from
the
White
House
shelter
asked
if
there
were
any
indications
of
another
hijacked
aircraft
The
deputy
director
for
operations
mentioned
the
Delta
flight
and
concluded
that
"that
would
be
the
fourth
possible
hijack."
At
9:49
the
commander
of
NORAD
directed
all
air
sovereignty
aircraft
to
battle
stations
fully
armed
At
9:59
an
Air
Force
lieutenant
colonel
working
in
the
White
House
Military
Office
joined
the
conference
and
stated
he
had
just
talked
to
Deputy
National
Security
Advisor
Stephen
Hadley
The
White
House
requested
(1)
the
implementation
of
continuity
of
government
measures
(2)
fighter
escorts
for
Air
Force
One
and
(3)
fighter
combat
air
patrol
over
Washington
D.C
By
10:03
when
United
93
crashed
in
Pennsylvania
there
had
been
no
mention
of
its
hijacking
and
the
FAA
had
not
yet
been
added
to
the
teleconference
The
President
and
the
Vice
President
The
President
was
seated
in
classroom
when
at
9:05
Andrew
Card
whispered
to
him:
"A
second
plane
hit
the
second
tower
America
is
under
attack."
The
President
told
us
his
instinct
was
to
project
calm
not
to
have
the
country
see
an
excited
reaction
at
moment
of
crisis
The
press
was
standing
behind
the
children;
he
saw
their
phones
and
pagers
start
to
ring
The
President
felt
he
should
project
strength
and
calm
until
he
could
better
understand
what
was
happening
The
President
remained
in
the
classroom
for
another
five
to
seven
minutes
while
the
children
continued
reading
He
then
returned
to
holding
room
shortly
before
9:15
where
he
was
briefed
by
staff
and
saw
television
coverage
He
next
spoke
to
Vice
President
Cheney
Dr
Rice
New
York
Governor
George
Pataki
and
FBI
Director
Robert
Mueller
He
decided
to
make
brief
statement
from
the
school
before
leaving
for
the
airport
The
Secret
Service
told
us
they
were
anxious
to
move
the
President
to
safer
location
but
did
not
think
it
imperative
for
him
to
run
out
the
door
Between
9:15
and
9:30
the
staff
was
busy
arranging
return
to
Washington
while
the
President
consulted
his
senior
advisers
about
his
remarks
No
one
in
the
traveling
party
had
any
information
during
this
time
that
other
aircraft
were
hijacked
or
missing
Staff
was
in
contact
with
the
White
House
Situation
Room
but
as
far
as
we
could
determine
no
one
with
the
President
was
in
contact
with
the
Pentagon
The
focus
was
on
the
President's
statement
to
the
nation
The
only
decision
made
during
this
time
was
to
return
to
Washington
The
President's
motorcade
departed
at
9:35
and
arrived
at
the
airport
between
9:42
and
9:45
During
the
ride
the
President
learned
about
the
attack
on
the
Pentagon
He
boarded
the
aircraft
asked
the
Secret
Service
about
the
safety
of
his
family
and
called
the
Vice
President
According
to
notes
of
the
call
at
about
9:45
the
President
told
the
Vice
President:"Sounds
like
we
have
minor
war
going
on
here
heard
about
the
Pentagon
We're
at
war
somebody's
going
to
pay."
About
this
time
Card
the
lead
Secret
Service
agent
the
President's
military
aide
and
the
pilot
were
conferring
on
possible
destination
for
Air
Force
One
The
Secret
Service
agent
felt
strongly
that
the
situation
in
Washington
was
too
unstable
for
the
President
to
return
there
and
Card
agreed
The
President
strongly
wanted
to
return
to
Washington
and
only
grudgingly
agreed
to
go
elsewhere
The
issue
was
still
undecided
when
the
President
conferred
with
the
Vice
President
at
about
the
time
Air
Force
One
was
taking
off
The
Vice
President
recalled
urging
the
President
not
to
return
to
Washington
Air
Force
One
departed
at
about
9:54
without
any
fixed
destination
The
objective
was
to
get
up
in
the
air-as
fast
and
as
high
as
possible-and
then
decide
where
to
go
At
9:33
the
tower
supervisor
at
Reagan
National
Airport
picked
up
hotline
to
the
Secret
Service
and
told
the
Service's
operations
center
that
"an
aircraft
[is]
coming
at
you
and
not
talking
with
us."
This
was
the
first
specific
report
to
the
Secret
Service
of
direct
threat
to
the
White
House
No
move
was
made
to
evacuate
the
Vice
President
at
this
time
As
the
officer
who
took
the
call
explained
"[I
was]
about
to
push
the
alert
button
when
the
tower
advised
that
the
aircraft
was
turning
south
and
approaching
Reagan
National
Airport."
American
77
began
turning
south
away
from
the
White
House
at
9:34
It
continued
heading
south
for
roughly
minute
before
turning
west
and
beginning
to
circle
back
This
news
prompted
the
Secret
Service
to
order
the
immediate
evacuation
of
the
Vice
President
just
before
9:36
Agents
propelled
him
out
of
his
chair
and
told
him
he
had
to
get
to
the
bunker
The
Vice
President
entered
the
underground
tunnel
leading
to
the
shelter
at
9:37
Once
inside
Vice
President
Cheney
and
the
agents
paused
in
an
area
of
the
tunnel
that
had
secure
phone
bench
and
television
The
Vice
President
asked
to
speak
to
the
President
but
it
took
time
for
the
call
to
be
connected
He
learned
in
the
tunnel
that
the
Pentagon
had
been
hit
and
he
saw
television
coverage
of
smoke
coming
from
the
building
The
Secret
Service
logged
Mrs
Cheney's
arrival
at
the
White
House
at
9:52
and
she
joined
her
husband
in
the
tunnel
According
to
contemporaneous
notes
at
9:55
the
Vice
President
was
still
on
the
phone
with
the
President
advising
that
three
planes
were
missing
and
one
had
hit
the
Pentagon
We
believe
this
is
the
same
call
in
which
the
Vice
President
urged
the
President
not
to
return
to
Washington
After
the
call
ended
Mrs
Cheney
and
the
Vice
President
moved
from
the
tunnel
to
the
shelter
conference
room
United
93
and
the
Shootdown
Order
On
the
morning
of
9/11
the
President
and
Vice
President
stayed
in
contact
not
by
an
open
line
of
communication
but
through
series
of
calls
The
President
told
us
he
was
frustrated
with
the
poor
communications
that
morning
He
could
not
reach
key
officials
including
Secretary
Rumsfeld
for
period
of
time
The
line
to
the
White
House
shelter
conference
room-and
the
Vice
President-
kept
cutting
off
The
Vice
President
remembered
placing
call
to
the
President
just
after
entering
the
shelter
conference
room
There
is
conflicting
evidence
about
when
the
Vice
President
arrived
in
the
shelter
conference
room
We
have
concluded
from
the
available
evidence
that
the
Vice
President
arrived
in
the
room
shortly
before
10:00
perhaps
at
9:58
The
Vice
President
recalled
being
told
just
after
his
arrival
that
the
Air
Force
was
trying
to
establish
combat
air
patrol
over
Washington
The
Vice
President
stated
that
he
called
the
President
to
discuss
the
rules
of
engagement
for
the
CAP
He
recalled
feeling
that
it
did
no
good
to
establish
the
CAP
unless
the
pilots
had
instructions
on
whether
they
were
authorized
to
shoot
if
the
plane
would
not
divert
He
said
the
President
signed
off
on
that
concept
The
President
said
he
remembered
such
conversation
and
that
it
reminded
him
of
when
he
had
been
an
interceptor
pilot
The
President
emphasized
to
us
that
he
had
authorized
the
shootdown
of
hijacked
aircraft
The
Vice
President's
military
aide
told
us
he
believed
the
Vice
President
spoke
to
the
President
just
after
entering
the
conference
room
but
he
did
not
hear
what
they
said
Rice
who
entered
the
room
shortly
after
the
Vice
President
and
sat
next
to
him
remembered
hearing
him
inform
the
President
"Sir
the
CAPs
are
up
Sir
they're
going
to
want
to
know
what
to
do."
Then
she
recalled
hearing
him
say
"Yes
sir."
She
believed
this
conversation
occurred
few
minutes
perhaps
five
after
they
entered
the
conference
room
We
believe
this
call
would
have
taken
place
sometime
before
10:10
to
10:15
Among
the
sources
that
reflect
other
important
events
of
that
morning
there
is
no
documentary
evidence
for
this
call
but
the
relevant
sources
are
incomplete
Others
nearby
who
were
taking
notes
such
as
the
Vice
President's
chief
of
staff
Scooter
Libby
who
sat
next
to
him
and
Mrs
Cheney
did
not
note
call
between
the
President
and
Vice
President
immediately
after
the
Vice
President
entered
the
conference
room
At
10:02
the
communicators
in
the
shelter
began
receiving
reports
from
the
Secret
Service
of
an
inbound
aircraft-presumably
hijacked-heading
toward
Washington
That
aircraft
was
United
93
The
Secret
Service
was
getting
this
information
directly
from
the
FAA
The
FAA
may
have
been
tracking
the
progress
of
United
93
on
display
that
showed
its
projected
path
to
Washington
not
its
actual
radar
return
Thus
the
Secret
Service
was
relying
on
projections
and
was
not
aware
the
plane
was
already
down
in
Pennsylvania
At
some
time
between
10:10
and
10:15
military
aide
told
the
Vice
President
and
others
that
the
aircraft
was
80
miles
out
Vice
President
Cheney
was
asked
for
authority
to
engage
the
aircraft
His
reaction
was
described
by
Scooter
Libby
as
quick
and
decisive
"in
about
the
time
it
takes
batter
to
decide
to
swing."
The
Vice
President
authorized
fighter
aircraft
to
engage
the
inbound
plane
He
told
us
he
based
this
authorization
on
his
earlier
conversation
with
the
President
The
military
aide
returned
few
minutes
later
probably
between
10:12
and
10:18
and
said
the
aircraft
was
60
miles
out
He
again
asked
for
authorization
to
engage
The
Vice
President
again
said
yes
At
the
conference
room
table
was
White
House
Deputy
Chief
of
Staff
Joshua
Bolten
Bolten
watched
the
exchanges
and
after
what
he
called
"a
quiet
moment,"suggested
that
the
Vice
President
get
in
touch
with
the
President
and
confirm
the
engage
order
Bolten
told
us
he
wanted
to
make
sure
the
President
was
told
that
the
Vice
President
had
executed
the
order
He
said
he
had
not
heard
any
prior
discussion
on
the
subject
with
the
President
The
Vice
President
was
logged
calling
the
President
at
10:18
for
twominute
conversation
that
obtained
the
confirmation
On
Air
Force
One
the
President's
press
secretary
was
taking
notes;
Ari
Fleischer
recorded
that
at
10:20
the
President
told
him
that
he
had
authorized
shootdown
of
aircraft
if
necessary
Minutes
went
by
and
word
arrived
of
an
aircraft
down
in
Pennsylvania
Those
in
the
shelter
wondered
if
the
aircraft
had
been
shot
down
pursuant
to
this
authorization
At
approximately
10:30
the
shelter
started
receiving
reports
of
another
hijacked
plane
this
time
only
to
10
miles
out
Believing
they
had
only
minute
or
two
the
Vice
President
again
communicated
the
authorization
to
"engage
or
"take
out"
the
aircraft
At
10:33
Hadley
told
the
air
threat
conference
call:
"I
need
to
get
word
to
Dick
Myers
that
our
reports
are
there's
an
inbound
aircraft
flying
low
miles
out
The
Vice
President's
guidance
was
we
need
to
take
them
out."
Once
again
there
was
no
immediate
information
about
the
fate
of
the
inbound
aircraft
In
the
apt
description
of
one
witness
"It
drops
below
the
radar
screen
and
it's
just
continually
hovering
in
your
imagination;
you
don't
know
where
it
is
or
what
happens
to
it."
Eventually
the
shelter
received
word
that
the
alleged
hijacker
miles
away
had
been
medevac
helicopter
Transmission
of
the
Authorization
from
the
White
House
to
the
Pilots
The
NMCC
learned
of
United
93's
hijacking
at
about
10:03
At
this
time
the
FAA
had
no
contact
with
the
military
at
the
level
of
national
command
The
NMCC
learned
about
United
93
from
the
White
House
It
in
turn
was
informed
by
the
Secret
Service's
contacts
with
the
FAA
NORAD
had
no
information
either
At
10:07
its
representative
on
the
air
threat
conference
call
stated
that
NORAD
had
"no
indication
of
hijack
heading
to
DC
at
this
time."
Repeatedly
between
10:14
and
10:19
lieutenant
colonel
at
the
White
House
relayed
to
the
NMCC
that
the
Vice
President
had
confirmed
fighters
were
cleared
to
engage
inbound
aircraft
if
they
could
verify
that
the
aircraft
was
hijacked
The
commander
of
NORAD
General
Ralph
Eberhart
was
en
route
to
the
NORAD
operations
center
in
Cheyenne
Mountain
Colorado
when
the
shootdown
order
was
communicated
on
the
air
threat
conference
call
He
told
us
that
by
the
time
he
arrived
the
order
had
already
been
passed
down
NORAD's
chain
of
command
It
is
not
clear
how
the
shootdown
order
was
communicated
within
NORAD
But
we
know
that
at
10:31
General
Larry
Arnold
instructed
his
staff
to
broadcast
the
following
over
NORAD
instant
messaging
system:
"10:31
Vice
president
has
cleared
to
us
to
intercept
tracks
of
interest
and
shoot
them
down
if
they
do
not
respond
per
[General
Arnold]."
In
upstate
New
York
NEADS
personnel
first
learned
of
the
shootdown
order
from
this
message:
Floor
Leadership:
You
need
to
read
this
The
Region
Commander
has
declared
that
we
can
shoot
down
aircraft
that
do
not
respond
to
our
direction
Copy
that?
Controllers:
Copy
that
sir
Floor
Leadership:
So
if
you're
trying
to
divert
somebody
and
he
won't
divert-
Controllers:
DO
[Director
of
Operations]
is
saying
no
Floor
Leadership:
No?
It
came
over
the
chat
You
got
conflict
on
that
direction?
Controllers:
Right
now
no
but-
Floor
Leadership:
Okay?
Okay
you
read
that
from
the
Vice
President
right?
Vice
President
has
cleared
Vice
President
has
cleared
us
to
intercept
traffic
and
shoot
them
down
if
they
do
not
respond
per
[General
Arnold]
In
interviews
with
us
NEADS
personnel
expressed
considerable
confusion
over
the
nature
and
effect
of
the
order
The
NEADS
commander
told
us
he
did
not
pass
along
the
order
because
he
was
unaware
of
its
ramifications
Both
the
mission
commander
and
the
senior
weapons
director
indicated
they
did
not
pass
the
order
to
the
fighters
circling
Washington
and
New
York
because
they
were
unsure
how
the
pilots
would
or
should
proceed
with
this
guidance
In
short
while
leaders
in
Washington
believed
that
the
fighters
above
them
had
been
instructed
to
"take
out"
hostile
aircraft
the
only
orders
actually
conveyed
to
the
pilots
were
to
"ID
type
and
tail."
In
most
cases
the
chain
of
command
authorizing
the
use
of
force
runs
from
the
president
to
the
secretary
of
defense
and
from
the
secretary
to
the
combatant
commander
The
President
apparently
spoke
to
Secretary
Rumsfeld
for
the
first
time
that
morning
shortly
after
10:00
No
one
can
recall
the
content
of
this
conversation
but
it
was
brief
call
in
which
the
subject
of
shootdown
authority
was
not
discussed
At
10:39
the
Vice
President
updated
the
Secretary
on
the
air
threat
conference:
Vice
President:
There's
been
at
least
three
instances
here
where
we've
had
reports
of
aircraft
approaching
Washington-a
couple
were
confirmed
hijack
And
pursuant
to
the
President's
instructions
gave
authorization
for
them
to
be
taken
out
Hello?
SecDef:
Yes
understand
Who
did
you
give
that
direction
to?
Vice
President:
It
was
passed
from
here
through
the
[operations]
center
at
the
White
House
from
the
[shelter]
SecDef:
OK
let
me
ask
the
question
here
Has
that
directive
been
transmitted
to
the
aircraft?
Vice
President:
Yes
it
has
SecDef:
So
we've
got
couple
of
aircraft
up
there
that
have
those
instructions
at
this
present
time?
Vice
President:
That
is
correct
And
it's
my
understanding
they've
already
taken
couple
of
aircraft
out
SecDef:
We
can't
confirm
that
We're
told
that
one
aircraft
is
down
but
we
do
not
have
pilot
report
that
did
it
As
this
exchange
shows
Secretary
Rumsfeld
was
not
in
the
NMCC
when
the
shootdown
order
was
first
conveyed
He
went
from
the
parking
lot
to
his
office
(where
he
spoke
to
the
President)
then
to
the
Executive
Support
Center
where
he
participated
in
the
White
House
video
teleconference
He
moved
to
the
NMCC
shortly
before
10:30
in
order
to
join
Vice
Chairman
Myers
Secretary
Rumsfeld
told
us
he
was
just
gaining
situational
awareness
when
he
spoke
with
the
Vice
President
at
10:39
His
primary
concern
was
ensuring
that
the
pilots
had
clear
understanding
of
their
rules
of
engagement
The
Vice
President
was
mistaken
in
his
belief
that
shootdown
authorization
had
been
passed
to
the
pilots
flying
at
NORAD's
direction
By
10:45
there
was
however
another
set
of
fighters
circling
Washington
that
had
entirely
different
rules
of
engagement
These
fighters
part
of
the
113th
Wing
of
the
District
of
Columbia
Air
National
Guard
launched
out
of
Andrews
Air
Force
Base
in
Maryland
in
response
to
information
passed
to
them
by
the
Secret
Service
The
first
of
the
Andrews
fighters
was
airborne
at
10:38
General
David
Wherley-the
commander
of
the
113th
Wing-reached
out
to
the
Secret
Service
after
hearing
secondhand
reports
that
it
wanted
fighters
airborne
Secret
Service
agent
had
phone
in
each
ear
one
connected
to
Wherley
and
the
other
to
fellow
agent
at
the
White
House
relaying
instructions
that
the
White
House
agent
said
he
was
getting
from
the
Vice
President
The
guidance
for
Wherley
was
to
send
up
the
aircraft
with
orders
to
protect
the
White
House
and
take
out
any
aircraft
that
threatened
the
Capitol
General
Wherley
translated
this
in
military
terms
to
flying
"weapons
free"-that
is
the
decision
to
shoot
rests
in
the
cockpit
or
in
this
case
in
the
cockpit
of
the
lead
pilot
He
passed
these
instructions
to
the
pilots
that
launched
at
10:42
and
afterward
Thus
while
the
fighter
pilots
under
NORAD
direction
who
had
scrambled
out
of
Langley
never
received
any
type
of
engagement
order
the
Andrews
pilots
were
operating
weapons
free-a
permissive
rule
of
engagement
The
President
and
the
Vice
President
indicated
to
us
they
had
not
been
aware
that
fighters
had
been
scrambled
out
of
Andrews
at
the
request
of
the
Secret
Service
and
outside
the
military
chain
of
command
There
is
no
evidence
that
NORAD
headquarters
or
military
officials
in
the
NMCC
knew-during
the
morning
of
September
11-that
the
Andrews
planes
were
airborne
and
operating
under
different
rules
of
engagement
What
If?
NORAD
officials
have
maintained
consistently
that
had
the
passengers
not
caused
United
93
to
crash
the
military
would
have
prevented
it
from
reaching
Washington
D.C
That
conclusion
is
based
on
version
of
events
that
we
now
know
is
incorrect
The
Langley
fighters
were
not
scrambled
in
response
to
United
93;
NORAD
did
not
have
47
minutes
to
intercept
the
flight;
NORAD
did
not
even
know
the
plane
was
hijacked
until
after
it
had
crashed
It
is
appropriate
therefore
to
reconsider
whether
United
93
would
have
been
intercepted
Had
it
not
crashed
in
Pennsylvania
at
10:03
we
estimate
that
United
93
could
not
have
reached
Washington
any
earlier
than
10:13
and
probably
would
have
arrived
before
10:23
There
was
only
one
set
of
fighters
circling
Washington
during
that
time
frame-the
Langley
F-16s
They
were
armed
and
under
NORAD's
control
After
NEADS
learned
of
the
hijacking
at
10:07
NORAD
would
have
had
from
to
16
minutes
to
locate
the
flight
receive
authorization
to
shoot
it
down
and
communicate
the
order
to
the
pilots
who
(in
the
same
span)
would
have
had
to
authenticate
the
order
intercept
the
flight
and
execute
the
order
At
that
point
in
time
the
Langley
pilots
did
not
know
the
threat
they
were
facing
did
not
know
where
United
93
was
located
and
did
not
have
shootdown
authorization
First
the
Langley
pilots
were
never
briefed
about
the
reason
they
were
scrambled
As
the
lead
pilot
explained
"I
reverted
to
the
Russian
threat
I'm
thinking
cruise
missile
threat
from
the
sea
You
know
you
look
down
and
see
the
Pentagon
burning
and
thought
the
bastards
snuck
one
by
us
[Y]ou
couldn't
see
any
airplanes
and
no
one
told
us
anything."
The
pilots
knew
their
mission
was
to
divert
aircraft
but
did
not
know
that
the
threat
came
from
hijacked
airliners
Second
NEADS
did
not
have
accurate
information
on
the
location
of
United
93
Presumably
FAA
would
have
provided
such
information
but
we
do
not
know
how
long
that
would
have
taken
nor
how
long
it
would
have
taken
NEADS
to
locate
the
target
Third
NEADS
needed
orders
to
pass
to
the
pilots
At
10:10
the
pilots
over
Washington
were
emphatically
told
"negative
clearance
to
shoot."
Shootdown
authority
was
first
communicated
to
NEADS
at
10:31
It
is
possible
that
NORAD
commanders
would
have
ordered
shootdown
in
the
absence
of
the
authorization
communicated
by
the
Vice
President
but
given
the
gravity
of
the
decision
to
shoot
down
commercial
airliner
and
NORAD's
caution
that
mistake
not
be
made
we
view
this
possibility
as
unlikely
NORAD
officials
have
maintained
that
they
would
have
intercepted
and
shot
down
United
93
We
are
not
so
sure
We
are
sure
that
the
nation
owes
debt
to
the
passengers
of
United
93
Their
actions
saved
the
lives
of
countless
others
and
may
have
saved
either
the
Capitol
or
the
White
House
from
destruction
The
details
of
what
happened
on
the
morning
of
September
11
are
complex
but
they
play
out
simple
theme
NORAD
and
the
FAA
were
unprepared
for
the
type
of
attacks
launched
against
the
United
States
on
September
11
2001
They
struggled
under
difficult
circumstances
to
improvise
homeland
defense
against
an
unprecedented
challenge
they
had
never
before
encountered
and
had
never
trained
to
meet
At
10:02
that
morning
an
assistant
to
the
mission
crew
commander
at
NORAD's
Northeast
Air
Defense
Sector
in
Rome
New
York
was
working
with
his
colleagues
on
the
floor
of
the
command
center
In
brief
moment
of
reflection
he
was
recorded
remarking
that
"This
is
new
type
of
war."
He
was
and
is
right
But
the
conflict
did
not
begin
on
9/11
It
had
been
publicly
declared
years
earlier
most
notably
in
declaration
faxed
early
in
1998
to
an
Arabic-language
newspaper
in
London
Few
Americans
had
noticed
it
The
fax
had
been
sent
from
thousands
of
miles
away
by
the
followers
of
Saudi
exile
gathered
in
one
of
the
most
remote
and
impoverished
countries
on
earth
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
NEW
TERRORISM
DECLARATION
OF
WAR
In
February
1998
the
40-year-old
Saudi
exile
Usama
Bin
Ladin
and
fugitive
Egyptian
physician
Ayman
al
Zawahiri
arranged
from
their
Afghan
headquarters
for
an
Arabic
newspaper
in
London
to
publish
what
they
termed
fatwa
issued
in
the
name
of
"World
Islamic
Front."
fatwa
is
normally
an
interpretation
of
Islamic
law
by
respected
Islamic
authority
but
neither
Bin
Ladin
Zawahiri
nor
the
three
others
who
signed
this
statement
were
scholars
of
Islamic
law
Claiming
that
America
had
declared
war
against
God
and
his
messenger
they
called
for
the
murder
of
any
American
anywhere
on
earth
as
the
"individual
duty
for
every
Muslim
who
can
do
it
in
any
country
in
which
it
is
possible
to
do
it."
Three
months
later
when
interviewed
in
Afghanistan
by
ABC-TV
Bin
Ladin
enlarged
on
these
themes
He
claimed
it
was
more
important
for
Muslims
to
kill
Americans
than
to
kill
other
infidels."
It
is
far
better
for
anyone
to
kill
single
American
soldier
than
to
squander
his
efforts
on
other
activities,"
he
said
Asked
whether
he
approved
of
terrorism
and
of
attacks
on
civilians
he
replied:"We
believe
that
the
worst
thieves
in
the
world
today
and
the
worst
terrorists
are
the
Americans
Nothing
could
stop
you
except
perhaps
retaliation
in
kind
We
do
not
have
to
differentiate
between
military
or
civilian
As
far
as
we
are
concerned
they
are
all
targets."
Note:
Islamic
names
often
do
not
follow
the
Western
practice
of
the
consistent
use
of
surnames
Given
the
variety
of
names
we
mention
we
chose
to
refer
to
individuals
by
the
last
word
in
the
names
by
which
they
are
known:
Nawaf
al
Hazmi
as
Hazmi
for
instance
omitting
the
article
"al"
that
would
be
part
of
their
name
in
their
own
societies
We
generally
make
an
exception
for
the
more
familiar
English
usage
of
"Bin"
as
part
of
last
name
as
in
Bin
Ladin
Further
there
is
no
universally
accepted
way
to
transliterate
Arabic
words
and
names
into
English
We
have
relied
on
mix
of
common
sense
the
sound
of
the
name
in
Arabic
and
common
usage
in
source
materials
the
press
or
government
documents
When
we
quote
from
source
document
we
use
its
transliteration
e.g.,"al
Qida"
instead
of
al
Qaeda
Though
novel
for
its
open
endorsement
of
indiscriminate
killing
Bin
Ladin's
1998
declaration
was
only
the
latest
in
the
long
series
of
his
public
and
private
calls
since
1992
that
singled
out
the
United
States
for
attack
In
August
1996
Bin
Ladin
had
issued
his
own
self-styled
fatwa
calling
on
Muslims
to
drive
American
soldiers
out
of
Saudi
Arabia
The
long
disjointed
document
condemned
the
Saudi
monarchy
for
allowing
the
presence
of
an
army
of
infidels
in
land
with
the
sites
most
sacred
to
Islam
and
celebrated
recent
suicide
bombings
of
American
military
facilities
in
the
Kingdom
It
praised
the
1983
suicide
bombing
in
Beirut
that
killed
241
U.S
Marines
the
1992
bombing
in
Aden
and
especially
the
1993
firefight
in
Somalia
after
which
the
United
States
"left
the
area
carrying
disappointment
humiliation
defeat
and
your
dead
with
you."
Bin
Ladin
said
in
his
ABC
interview
that
he
and
his
followers
had
been
preparing
in
Somalia
for
another
long
struggle
like
that
against
the
Soviets
in
Afghanistan
but
"the
United
States
rushed
out
of
Somalia
in
shame
and
disgrace."
Citing
the
Soviet
army's
withdrawal
from
Afghanistan
as
proof
that
ragged
army
of
dedicated
Muslims
could
overcome
superpower
he
told
the
interviewer:
"We
are
certain
that
we
shall-with
the
grace
of
Allah-prevail
over
the
Americans."
He
went
on
to
warn
that
"If
the
present
injustice
continues
it
will
inevitably
move
the
battle
to
American
soil."
Plans
to
attack
the
United
States
were
developed
with
unwavering
singlemindedness
throughout
the
1990s
Bin
Ladin
saw
himself
as
called
"to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
the
Messenger
and
to
communicate
his
message
to
all
nations,"
and
to
serve
as
the
rallying
point
and
organizer
of
new
kind
of
war
to
destroy
America
and
bring
the
world
to
Islam
BIN
LADIN'S
APPEAL
IN
THE
ISLAMIC
WORLD
It
is
the
story
of
eccentric
and
violent
ideas
sprouting
in
the
fertile
ground
of
political
and
social
turmoil
It
is
the
story
of
an
organization
poised
to
seize
its
historical
moment
How
did
Bin
Ladin-with
his
call
for
the
indiscriminate
killing
of
Americans-win
thousands
of
followers
and
some
degree
of
approval
from
millions
more?
The
history
culture
and
body
of
beliefs
from
which
Bin
Ladin
has
shaped
and
spread
his
message
are
largely
unknown
to
many
Americans
Seizing
on
symbols
of
Islam's
past
greatness
he
promises
to
restore
pride
to
people
who
consider
themselves
the
victims
of
successive
foreign
masters
He
uses
cultural
and
religious
allusions
to
the
holy
Qur'an
and
some
of
its
interpreters
He
appeals
to
people
disoriented
by
cyclonic
change
as
they
confront
modernity
and
globalization
His
rhetoric
selectively
draws
from
multiple
sources-Islam
history
and
the
region's
political
and
economic
malaise
He
also
stresses
grievances
against
the
United
States
widely
shared
in
the
Muslim
world
He
inveighed
against
the
presence
of
U.S
troops
in
Saudi
Arabia
the
home
of
Islam's
holiest
sites
He
spoke
of
the
suffering
of
the
Iraqi
people
as
result
of
sanctions
imposed
after
the
Gulf
War
and
he
protested
U.S
support
of
Israel
Islam
Islam
(a
word
that
literally
means
"surrender
to
the
will
of
God")
arose
in
Arabia
with
what
Muslims
believe
are
series
of
revelations
to
the
Prophet
Mohammed
from
the
one
and
only
God
the
God
of
Abraham
and
of
Jesus
These
revelations
conveyed
by
the
angel
Gabriel
are
recorded
in
the
Qur'an
Muslims
believe
that
these
revelations
given
to
the
greatest
and
last
of
chain
of
prophets
stretching
from
Abraham
through
Jesus
complete
God's
message
to
humanity
The
Hadith
which
recount
Mohammed's
sayings
and
deeds
as
recorded
by
his
contemporaries
are
another
fundamental
source
third
key
element
is
the
Sharia
the
code
of
law
derived
from
the
Qur'an
and
the
Hadith
Islam
is
divided
into
two
main
branches
Sunni
and
Shia
Soon
after
the
Prophet's
death
the
question
of
choosing
new
leader
or
caliph
for
the
Muslim
community
or
Ummah
arose
Initially
his
successors
could
be
drawn
from
the
Prophet's
contemporaries
but
with
time
this
was
no
longer
possible
Those
who
became
the
Shia
held
that
any
leader
of
the
Ummah
must
be
direct
descendant
of
the
Prophet;
those
who
became
the
Sunni
argued
that
lineal
descent
was
not
required
if
the
candidate
met
other
standards
of
faith
and
knowledge
After
bloody
struggles
the
Sunni
became
(and
remain)
the
majority
sect
(The
Shia
are
dominant
in
Iran.)
The
Caliphate-the
institutionalized
leadership
of
the
Ummah-thus
was
Sunni
institution
that
continued
until
1924
first
under
Arab
and
eventually
under
Ottoman
Turkish
control
Many
Muslims
look
back
at
the
century
after
the
revelations
to
the
Prophet
Mohammed
as
golden
age
Its
memory
is
strongest
among
the
Arabs
What
happened
then-the
spread
of
Islam
from
the
Arabian
Peninsula
throughout
the
Middle
East
North
Africa
and
even
into
Europe
within
less
than
century-
seemed
and
seems
miraculous
Nostalgia
for
Islam's
past
glory
remains
powerful
force
Islam
is
both
faith
and
code
of
conduct
for
all
aspects
of
life
For
many
Muslims
good
government
would
be
one
guided
by
the
moral
principles
of
their
faith
This
does
not
necessarily
translate
into
desire
for
clerical
rule
and
the
abolition
of
secular
state
It
does
mean
that
some
Muslims
tend
to
be
uncomfortable
with
distinctions
between
religion
and
state
though
Muslim
rulers
throughout
history
have
readily
separated
the
two
To
extremists
however
such
divisions
as
well
as
the
existence
of
parliaments
and
legislation
only
prove
these
rulers
to
be
false
Muslims
usurping
God's
authority
over
all
aspects
of
life
Periodically
the
Islamic
world
has
seen
surges
of
what
for
want
of
better
term
is
often
labeled
"fundamentalism."
Denouncing
waywardness
among
the
faithful
some
clerics
have
appealed
for
return
to
observance
of
the
literal
teachings
of
the
Qur'an
and
Hadith
One
scholar
from
the
fourteenth
century
from
whom
Bin
Ladin
selectively
quotes
Ibn
Taimiyyah
condemned
both
corrupt
rulers
and
the
clerics
who
failed
to
criticize
them
He
urged
Muslims
to
read
the
Qur'an
and
the
Hadith
for
themselves
not
to
depend
solely
on
learned
interpreters
like
himself
but
to
hold
one
another
to
account
for
the
quality
of
their
observance
The
extreme
Islamist
version
of
history
blames
the
decline
from
Islam's
golden
age
on
the
rulers
and
people
who
turned
away
from
the
true
path
of
their
religion
thereby
leaving
Islam
vulnerable
to
encroaching
foreign
powers
eager
to
steal
their
land
wealth
and
even
their
souls
Bin
Ladin's
Worldview
Despite
his
claims
to
universal
leadership
Bin
Ladin
offers
an
extreme
view
of
Islamic
history
designed
to
appeal
mainly
to
Arabs
and
Sunnis
He
draws
on
fundamentalists
who
blame
the
eventual
destruction
of
the
Caliphate
on
leaders
who
abandoned
the
pure
path
of
religious
devotion
He
repeatedly
calls
on
his
followers
to
embrace
martyrdom
since
"the
walls
of
oppression
and
humiliation
cannot
be
demolished
except
in
rain
of
bullets."
For
those
yearning
for
lost
sense
of
order
in
an
older
more
tranquil
world
he
offers
his
"Caliphate"
as
an
imagined
alternative
to
today's
uncertainty
For
others
he
offers
simplistic
conspiracies
to
explain
their
world
Bin
Ladin
also
relies
heavily
on
the
Egyptian
writer
Sayyid
Qutb
member
of
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
executed
in
1966
on
charges
of
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government
Qutb
mixed
Islamic
scholarship
with
very
superficial
acquaintance
with
Western
history
and
thought
Sent
by
the
Egyptian
government
to
study
in
the
United
States
in
the
late
1940s
Qutb
returned
with
an
enormous
loathing
of
Western
society
and
history
He
dismissed
Western
achievements
as
entirely
material
arguing
that
Western
society
possesses
"nothing
that
will
satisfy
its
own
conscience
and
justify
its
existence."
Three
basic
themes
emerge
from
Qutb's
writings
First
he
claimed
that
the
world
was
beset
with
barbarism
licentiousness
and
unbelief
(a
condition
he
called
jahiliyya
the
religious
term
for
the
period
of
ignorance
prior
to
the
revelations
given
to
the
Prophet
Mohammed)
Qutb
argued
that
humans
can
choose
only
between
Islam
and
jahiliyya
Second
he
warned
that
more
people
including
Muslims
were
attracted
to
jahiliyya
and
its
material
comforts
than
to
his
view
of
Islam;
jahiliyya
could
therefore
triumph
over
Islam
Third
no
middle
ground
exists
in
what
Qutb
conceived
as
struggle
between
God
and
Satan
All
Muslims-as
he
defined
them-therefore
must
take
up
arms
in
this
fight
Any
Muslim
who
rejects
his
ideas
is
just
one
more
nonbeliever
worthy
of
destruction
Bin
Ladin
shares
Qutb's
stark
view
permitting
him
and
his
followers
to
rationalize
even
unprovoked
mass
murder
as
righteous
defense
of
an
embattled
faith
Many
Americans
have
wondered
"Why
do
'they'
hate
us?"
Some
also
ask
"What
can
we
do
to
stop
these
attacks?"
Bin
Ladin
and
al
Qaeda
have
given
answers
to
both
these
questions
To
the
first
they
say
that
America
had
attacked
Islam;
America
is
responsible
for
all
conflicts
involving
Muslims
Thus
Americans
are
blamed
when
Israelis
fight
with
Palestinians
when
Russians
fight
with
Chechens
when
Indians
fight
with
Kashmiri
Muslims
and
when
the
Philippine
government
fights
ethnic
Muslims
in
its
southern
islands
America
is
also
held
responsible
for
the
governments
of
Muslim
countries
derided
by
al
Qaeda
as
"your
agents."
Bin
Ladin
has
stated
flatly,"Our
fight
against
these
governments
is
not
separate
from
our
fight
against
you."
These
charges
found
ready
audience
among
millions
of
Arabs
and
Muslims
angry
at
the
United
States
because
of
issues
ranging
from
Iraq
to
Palestine
to
America's
support
for
their
countries'
repressive
rulers
Bin
Ladin's
grievance
with
the
United
States
may
have
started
in
reaction
to
specific
U.S
policies
but
it
quickly
became
far
deeper
To
the
second
question
what
America
could
do
al
Qaeda's
answer
was
that
America
should
abandon
the
Middle
East
convert
to
Islam
and
end
the
immorality
and
godlessness
of
its
society
and
culture:"It
is
saddening
to
tell
you
that
you
are
the
worst
civilization
witnessed
by
the
history
of
mankind."
If
the
United
States
did
not
comply
it
would
be
at
war
with
the
Islamic
nation
nation
that
al
Qaeda's
leaders
said
"desires
death
more
than
you
desire
life."
History
and
Political
Context
Few
fundamentalist
movements
in
the
Islamic
world
gained
lasting
political
power
In
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
fundamentalists
helped
articulate
anticolonial
grievances
but
played
little
role
in
the
overwhelmingly
secular
struggles
for
independence
after
World
War
I
Western-educated
lawyers
soldiers
and
officials
led
most
independence
movements
and
clerical
influence
and
traditional
culture
were
seen
as
obstacles
to
national
progress
After
gaining
independence
from
Western
powers
following
World
War
II
the
Arab
Middle
East
followed
an
arc
from
initial
pride
and
optimism
to
today's
mix
of
indifference
cynicism
and
despair
In
several
countries
dynastic
state
already
existed
or
was
quickly
established
under
paramount
tribal
family
Monarchies
in
countries
such
as
Saudi
Arabia
Morocco
and
Jordan
still
survive
today
Those
in
Egypt
Libya
Iraq
and
Yemen
were
eventually
overthrown
by
secular
nationalist
revolutionaries
The
secular
regimes
promised
glowing
future
often
tied
to
sweeping
ideologies
(such
as
those
promoted
by
Egyptian
President
Gamal
Abdel
Nasser's
Arab
Socialism
or
the
Ba'ath
Party
of
Syria
and
Iraq)
that
called
for
single
secular
Arab
state
However
what
emerged
were
almost
invariably
autocratic
regimes
that
were
usually
unwilling
to
tolerate
any
opposition-even
in
countries
such
as
Egypt
that
had
parliamentary
tradition
Over
time
their
policies-
repression
rewards
emigration
and
the
displacement
of
popular
anger
onto
scapegoats
(generally
foreign)-were
shaped
by
the
desire
to
cling
to
power
The
bankruptcy
of
secular
autocratic
nationalism
was
evident
across
the
Muslim
world
by
the
late
1970s
At
the
same
time
these
regimes
had
closed
off
nearly
all
paths
for
peaceful
opposition
forcing
their
critics
to
choose
silence
exile
or
violent
opposition
Iran's
1979
revolution
swept
Shia
theocracy
into
power
Its
success
encouraged
Sunni
fundamentalists
elsewhere
In
the
1980s
awash
in
sudden
oil
wealth
Saudi
Arabia
competed
with
Shia
Iran
to
promote
its
Sunni
fundamentalist
interpretation
of
Islam
Wahhabism
The
Saudi
government
always
conscious
of
its
duties
as
the
custodian
of
Islam's
holiest
places
joined
with
wealthy
Arabs
from
the
Kingdom
and
other
states
bordering
the
Persian
Gulf
in
donating
money
to
build
mosques
and
religious
schools
that
could
preach
and
teach
their
interpretation
of
Islamic
doctrine
In
this
competition
for
legitimacy
secular
regimes
had
no
alternative
to
offer
Instead
in
number
of
cases
their
rulers
sought
to
buy
off
local
Islamist
movements
by
ceding
control
of
many
social
and
educational
issues
Emboldened
rather
than
satisfied
the
Islamists
continued
to
push
for
power-a
trend
especially
clear
in
Egypt
Confronted
with
violent
Islamist
movement
that
killed
President
Anwar
Sadat
in
1981
the
Egyptian
government
combined
harsh
repression
of
Islamic
militants
with
harassment
of
moderate
Islamic
scholars
and
authors
driving
many
into
exile
In
Pakistan
military
regime
sought
to
justify
its
seizure
of
power
by
pious
public
stance
and
an
embrace
of
unprecedented
Islamist
influence
on
education
and
society
These
experiments
in
political
Islam
faltered
during
the
1990s:
the
Iranian
revolution
lost
momentum
prestige
and
public
support
and
Pakistan's
rulers
found
that
most
of
its
population
had
little
enthusiasm
for
fundamentalist
Islam
Islamist
revival
movements
gained
followers
across
the
Muslim
world
but
failed
to
secure
political
power
except
in
Iran
and
Sudan
In
Algeria
where
in
1991
Islamists
seemed
almost
certain
to
win
power
through
the
ballot
box
the
military
preempted
their
victory
triggering
brutal
civil
war
that
continues
today
Opponents
of
today's
rulers
have
few
if
any
ways
to
participate
in
the
existing
political
system
They
are
thus
ready
audience
for
calls
to
Muslims
to
purify
their
society
reject
unwelcome
modernization
and
adhere
strictly
to
the
Sharia
Social
and
Economic
Malaise
In
the
1970s
and
early
1980s
an
unprecedented
flood
of
wealth
led
the
then
largely
unmodernized
oil
states
to
attempt
to
shortcut
decades
of
development
They
funded
huge
infrastructure
projects
vastly
expanded
education
and
created
subsidized
social
welfare
programs
These
programs
established
widespread
feeling
of
entitlement
without
corresponding
sense
of
social
obligations
By
the
late
1980s
diminishing
oil
revenues
the
economic
drain
from
many
unprofitable
development
projects
and
population
growth
made
these
entitlement
programs
unsustainable
The
resulting
cutbacks
created
enormous
resentment
among
recipients
who
had
come
to
see
government
largesse
as
their
right
This
resentment
was
further
stoked
by
public
understanding
of
how
much
oil
income
had
gone
straight
into
the
pockets
of
the
rulers
their
friends
and
their
helpers
Unlike
the
oil
states
(or
Afghanistan
where
real
economic
development
has
barely
begun)
the
other
Arab
nations
and
Pakistan
once
had
seemed
headed
toward
balanced
modernization
The
established
commercial
financial
and
industrial
sectors
in
these
states
supported
by
an
entrepreneurial
spirit
and
widespread
understanding
of
free
enterprise
augured
well
But
unprofitable
heavy
industry
state
monopolies
and
opaque
bureaucracies
slowly
stifled
growth
More
importantly
these
state-centered
regimes
placed
their
highest
priority
on
preserving
the
elite's
grip
on
national
wealth
Unwilling
to
foster
dynamic
economies
that
could
create
jobs
attractive
to
educated
young
men
the
countries
became
economically
stagnant
and
reliant
on
the
safety
valve
of
worker
emigration
either
to
the
Arab
oil
states
or
to
the
West
Furthermore
the
repression
and
isolation
of
women
in
many
Muslim
countries
have
not
only
seriously
limited
individual
opportunity
but
also
crippled
overall
economic
productivity
By
the
1990s
high
birthrates
and
declining
rates
of
infant
mortality
had
produced
common
problem
throughout
the
Muslim
world:
large
steadily
increasing
population
of
young
men
without
any
reasonable
expectation
of
suitable
or
steady
employment-a
sure
prescription
for
social
turbulence
Many
of
these
young
men
such
as
the
enormous
number
trained
only
in
religious
schools
lacked
the
skills
needed
by
their
societies
Far
more
acquired
valuable
skills
but
lived
in
stagnant
economies
that
could
not
generate
satisfying
jobs
Millions
pursuing
secular
as
well
as
religious
studies
were
products
of
educational
systems
that
generally
devoted
little
if
any
attention
to
the
rest
of
the
world's
thought
history
and
culture
The
secular
education
reflected
strong
cultural
preference
for
technical
fields
over
the
humanities
and
social
sciences
Many
of
these
young
men
even
if
able
to
study
abroad
lacked
the
perspective
and
skills
needed
to
understand
different
culture
Frustrated
in
their
search
for
decent
living
unable
to
benefit
from
an
education
often
obtained
at
the
cost
of
great
family
sacrifice
and
blocked
from
starting
families
of
their
own
some
of
these
young
men
were
easy
targets
for
radicalization
Bin
Ladin's
Historical
Opportunity
Most
Muslims
prefer
peaceful
and
inclusive
vision
of
their
faith
not
the
violent
sectarianism
of
Bin
Ladin
Among
Arabs
Bin
Ladin's
followers
are
commonly
nicknamed
takfiri
or
"those
who
define
other
Muslims
as
unbelievers,"
because
of
their
readiness
to
demonize
and
murder
those
with
whom
they
disagree
Beyond
the
theology
lies
the
simple
human
fact
that
most
Muslims
like
most
other
human
beings
are
repelled
by
mass
murder
and
barbarism
whatever
their
justification
"All
Americans
must
recognize
that
the
face
of
terror
is
not
the
true
face
of
Islam,"
President
Bush
observed."
Islam
is
faith
that
brings
comfort
to
billion
people
around
the
world
It's
faith
that
has
made
brothers
and
sisters
of
every
race
It's
faith
based
upon
love
not
hate."
Yet
as
political
social
and
economic
problems
created
flammable
societies
Bin
Ladin
used
Islam's
most
extreme
fundamentalist
traditions
as
his
match
All
these
elements-including
religion-combined
in
an
explosive
compound
Other
extremists
had
and
have
followings
of
their
own
But
in
appealing
to
societies
full
of
discontent
Bin
Ladin
remained
credible
as
other
leaders
and
symbols
faded
He
could
stand
as
symbol
of
resistance-above
all
resistance
to
the
West
and
to
America
He
could
present
himself
and
his
allies
as
victorious
warriors
in
the
one
great
successful
experience
for
Islamic
militancy
in
the
1980s:
the
Afghan
jihad
against
the
Soviet
occupation
By
1998
Bin
Ladin
had
distinctive
appeal
as
he
focused
on
attacking
America
He
argued
that
other
extremists
who
aimed
at
local
rulers
or
Israel
did
not
go
far
enough
They
had
not
taken
on
what
he
called
"the
head
of
the
snake."
Finally
Bin
Ladin
had
another
advantage:
substantial
worldwide
organization
By
the
time
he
issued
his
February
1998
declaration
of
war
Bin
Ladin
had
nurtured
that
organization
for
nearly
ten
years
He
could
attract
train
and
use
recruits
for
ever
more
ambitious
attacks
rallying
new
adherents
with
each
demonstration
that
his
was
the
movement
of
the
future
THE
RISE
OF
BIN
LADIN
AND
AL
QAEDA
(1988-1992)
decade
of
conflict
in
Afghanistan
from
1979
to
1989
gave
Islamist
extremists
rallying
point
and
training
field
Communist
government
in
Afghanistan
gained
power
in
1978
but
was
unable
to
establish
enduring
control
At
the
end
of
1979
the
Soviet
government
sent
in
military
units
to
ensure
that
the
country
would
remain
securely
under
Moscow's
influence
The
response
was
an
Afghan
national
resistance
movement
that
defeated
Soviet
forces
Young
Muslims
from
around
the
world
flocked
to
Afghanistan
to
join
as
volunteers
in
what
was
seen
as
"holy
war"-jihad-against
an
invader
The
largest
numbers
came
from
the
Middle
East
Some
were
Saudis
and
among
them
was
Usama
Bin
Ladin
Twenty-three
when
he
arrived
in
Afghanistan
in
1980
Bin
Ladin
was
the
seventeenth
of
57
children
of
Saudi
construction
magnate
Six
feet
five
and
thin
Bin
Ladin
appeared
to
be
ungainly
but
was
in
fact
quite
athletic
skilled
as
horseman
runner
climber
and
soccer
player
He
had
attended
Abdul
Aziz
University
in
Saudi
Arabia
By
some
accounts
he
had
been
interested
there
in
religious
studies
inspired
by
tape
recordings
of
fiery
sermons
by
Abdullah
Azzam
Palestinian
and
disciple
of
Qutb
Bin
Ladin
was
conspicuous
among
the
volunteers
not
because
he
showed
evidence
of
religious
learning
but
because
he
had
access
to
some
of
his
family's
huge
fortune
Though
he
took
part
in
at
least
one
actual
battle
he
became
known
chiefly
as
person
who
generously
helped
fund
the
anti-Soviet
jihad
Bin
Ladin
understood
better
than
most
of
the
volunteers
the
extent
to
which
the
continuation
and
eventual
success
of
the
jihad
in
Afghanistan
depended
on
an
increasingly
complex
almost
worldwide
organization
This
organization
included
financial
support
network
that
came
to
be
known
as
the
"Golden
Chain,"
put
together
mainly
by
financiers
in
Saudi
Arabia
and
the
Persian
Gulf
states
Donations
flowed
through
charities
or
other
nongovernmental
organizations
(NGOs)
Bin
Ladin
and
the
"Afghan
Arabs"
drew
largely
on
funds
raised
by
this
network
whose
agents
roamed
world
markets
to
buy
arms
and
supplies
for
the
mujahideen
or
"holy
warriors."
Mosques
schools
and
boardinghouses
served
as
recruiting
stations
in
many
parts
of
the
world
including
the
United
States
Some
were
set
up
by
Islamic
extremists
or
their
financial
backers
Bin
Ladin
had
an
important
part
in
this
activity
He
and
the
cleric
Azzam
had
joined
in
creating
"Bureau
of
Services"
(Mektab
al
Khidmat
or
MAK)
which
channeled
recruits
into
Afghanistan
The
international
environment
for
Bin
Ladin's
efforts
was
ideal
Saudi
Arabia
and
the
United
States
supplied
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
secret
assistance
to
rebel
groups
in
Afghanistan
fighting
the
Soviet
occupation
This
assistance
was
funneled
through
Pakistan:
the
Pakistani
military
intelligence
service
(Inter-
Services
Intelligence
Directorate
or
ISID)
helped
train
the
rebels
and
distribute
the
arms
But
Bin
Ladin
and
his
comrades
had
their
own
sources
of
support
and
training
and
they
received
little
or
no
assistance
from
the
United
States
April
1988
brought
victory
for
the
Afghan
jihad
Moscow
declared
it
would
pull
its
military
forces
out
of
Afghanistan
within
the
next
nine
months
As
the
Soviets
began
their
withdrawal
the
jihad's
leaders
debated
what
to
do
next
Bin
Ladin
and
Azzam
agreed
that
the
organization
successfully
created
for
Afghanistan
should
not
be
allowed
to
dissolve
They
established
what
they
called
base
or
foundation
(al
Qaeda)
as
potential
general
headquarters
for
future
jihad
Though
Azzam
had
been
considered
number
one
in
the
MAK
by
August
1988
Bin
Ladin
was
clearly
the
leader
(emir)
of
al
Qaeda
This
organization's
structure
included
as
its
operating
arms
an
intelligence
component
military
committee
financial
committee
political
committee
and
committee
in
charge
of
media
affairs
and
propaganda
It
also
had
an
Advisory
Council
(Shura)
made
up
of
Bin
Ladin's
inner
circle
Bin
Ladin's
assumption
of
the
helm
of
al
Qaeda
was
evidence
of
his
growing
self-confidence
and
ambition
He
soon
made
clear
his
desire
for
unchallenged
control
and
for
preparing
the
mujahideen
to
fight
anywhere
in
the
world
Azzam
by
contrast
favored
continuing
to
fight
in
Afghanistan
until
it
had
true
Islamist
government
And
as
Palestinian
he
saw
Israel
as
the
top
priority
for
the
next
stage
Whether
the
dispute
was
about
power
personal
differences
or
strategy
it
ended
on
November
24
1989
when
remotely
controlled
car
bomb
killed
Azzam
and
both
of
his
sons
The
killers
were
assumed
to
be
rival
Egyptians
The
outcome
left
Bin
Ladin
indisputably
in
charge
of
what
remained
of
the
MAK
and
al
Qaeda
Through
writers
like
Qutb
and
the
presence
of
Egyptian
Islamist
teachers
in
the
Saudi
educational
system
Islamists
already
had
strong
intellectual
influence
on
Bin
Ladin
and
his
al
Qaeda
colleagues
By
the
late
1980s
the
Egyptian
Islamist
movement-badly
battered
in
the
government
crackdown
following
President
Sadat's
assassination-was
centered
in
two
major
organizations:
the
Islamic
Group
and
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
spiritual
guide
for
both
but
especially
the
Islamic
Group
was
the
so-called
Blind
Sheikh
Omar
Abdel
Rahman
His
preaching
had
inspired
the
assassination
of
Sadat
After
being
in
and
out
of
Egyptian
prisons
during
the
1980s
Abdel
Rahman
found
refuge
in
the
United
States
From
his
headquarters
in
Jersey
City
he
distributed
messages
calling
for
the
murder
of
unbelievers
The
most
important
Egyptian
in
Bin
Ladin's
circle
was
surgeon
Ayman
al
Zawahiri
who
led
strong
faction
of
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
Many
of
his
followers
became
important
members
in
the
new
organization
and
his
own
close
ties
with
Bin
Ladin
led
many
to
think
of
him
as
the
deputy
head
of
al
Qaeda
He
would
in
fact
become
Bin
Ladin's
deputy
some
years
later
when
they
merged
their
organizations
Bin
Ladin
Moves
to
Sudan
By
the
fall
of
1989
Bin
Ladin
had
sufficient
stature
among
Islamic
extremists
that
Sudanese
political
leader
Hassan
al
Turabi
urged
him
to
transplant
his
whole
organization
to
Sudan
Turabi
headed
the
National
Islamic
Front
in
coalition
that
had
recently
seized
power
in
Khartoum
Bin
Ladin
agreed
to
help
Turabi
in
an
ongoing
war
against
African
Christian
separatists
in
southern
Sudan
and
also
to
do
some
road
building
Turabi
in
return
would
let
Bin
Ladin
use
Sudan
as
base
for
worldwide
business
operations
and
for
preparations
for
jihad
While
agents
of
Bin
Ladin
began
to
buy
property
in
Sudan
in
1990
Bin
Ladin
himself
moved
from
Afghanistan
back
to
Saudi
Arabia
In
August
1990
Iraq
invaded
Kuwait
Bin
Ladin
whose
efforts
in
Afghanistan
had
earned
him
celebrity
and
respect
proposed
to
the
Saudi
monarchy
that
he
summon
mujahideen
for
jihad
to
retake
Kuwait
He
was
rebuffed
and
the
Saudis
joined
the
U.S.-led
coalition
After
the
Saudis
agreed
to
allow
U.S
armed
forces
to
be
based
in
the
Kingdom
Bin
Ladin
and
number
of
Islamic
clerics
began
to
publicly
denounce
the
arrangement
The
Saudi
government
exiled
the
clerics
and
undertook
to
silence
Bin
Ladin
by
among
other
things
taking
away
his
passport
With
help
from
dissident
member
of
the
royal
family
he
managed
to
get
out
of
the
country
under
the
pretext
of
attending
an
Islamic
gathering
in
Pakistan
in
April
1991.33
By
1994
the
Saudi
government
would
freeze
his
financial
assets
and
revoke
his
citizenship
He
no
longer
had
country
he
could
call
his
own
Bin
Ladin
moved
to
Sudan
in
1991
and
set
up
large
and
complex
set
of
intertwined
business
and
terrorist
enterprises
In
time
the
former
would
encompass
numerous
companies
and
global
network
of
bank
accounts
and
nongovernmental
institutions
Fulfilling
his
bargain
with
Turabi
Bin
Ladin
used
his
construction
company
to
build
new
highway
from
Khartoum
to
Port
Sudan
on
the
Red
Sea
coast
Meanwhile
al
Qaeda
finance
officers
and
top
operatives
used
their
positions
in
Bin
Ladin's
businesses
to
acquire
weapons
explosives
and
technical
equipment
for
terrorist
purposes
One
founding
member
Abu
Hajer
al
Iraqi
used
his
position
as
head
of
Bin
Ladin
investment
company
to
carry
out
procurement
trips
from
western
Europe
to
the
Far
East
Two
others
Wadi
al
Hage
and
Mubarak
Douri
who
had
become
acquainted
in
Tucson
Arizona
in
the
late
1980s
went
as
far
afield
as
China
Malaysia
the
Philippines
and
the
former
Soviet
states
of
Ukraine
and
Belarus
Bin
Ladin's
impressive
array
of
offices
covertly
provided
financial
and
other
support
for
terrorist
activities
The
network
included
major
business
enterprise
in
Cyprus;
"services"
branch
in
Zagreb;
an
office
of
the
Benevolence
International
Foundation
in
Sarajevo
which
supported
the
Bosnian
Muslims
in
their
conflict
with
Serbia
and
Croatia;
and
an
NGO
in
Baku
Azerbaijan
that
was
employed
as
well
by
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
both
as
source
and
conduit
for
finances
and
as
support
center
for
the
Muslim
rebels
in
Chechnya
He
also
made
use
of
the
already-established
Third
World
Relief
Agency
(TWRA)
headquartered
in
Vienna
whose
branch
office
locations
included
Zagreb
and
Budapest
(Bin
Ladin
later
set
up
an
NGO
in
Nairobi
as
cover
for
operatives
there.)
Bin
Ladin
now
had
vision
of
himself
as
head
of
an
international
jihad
confederation
In
Sudan
he
established
an
"Islamic
Army
Shura"
that
was
to
serve
as
the
coordinating
body
for
the
consortium
of
terrorist
groups
with
which
he
was
forging
alliances
It
was
composed
of
his
own
al
Qaeda
Shura
together
with
leaders
or
representatives
of
terrorist
organizations
that
were
still
independent
In
building
this
Islamic
army
he
enlisted
groups
from
Saudi
Arabia
Egypt
Jordan
Lebanon
Iraq
Oman
Algeria
Libya
Tunisia
Morocco
Somalia
and
Eritrea
Al
Qaeda
also
established
cooperative
but
less
formal
relationships
with
other
extremist
groups
from
these
same
countries;
from
the
African
states
of
Chad
Mali
Niger
Nigeria
and
Uganda;
and
from
the
Southeast
Asian
states
of
Burma
Thailand
Malaysia
and
Indonesia
Bin
Ladin
maintained
connections
in
the
Bosnian
conflict
as
well
The
groundwork
for
true
global
terrorist
network
was
being
laid
Bin
Ladin
also
provided
equipment
and
training
assistance
to
the
Moro
Islamic
Liberation
Front
in
the
Philippines
and
also
to
newly
forming
Philippine
group
that
called
itself
the
Abu
Sayyaf
Brigade
after
one
of
the
major
Afghan
jihadist
commanders
Al
Qaeda
helped
Jemaah
Islamiya
(JI)
nascent
organization
headed
by
Indonesian
Islamists
with
cells
scattered
across
Malaysia
Singapore
Indonesia
and
the
Philippines
It
also
aided
Pakistani
group
engaged
in
insurrectionist
attacks
in
Kashmir
In
mid-1991
Bin
Ladin
dispatched
band
of
supporters
to
the
northern
Afghanistan
border
to
assist
the
Tajikistan
Islamists
in
the
ethnic
conflicts
that
had
been
boiling
there
even
before
the
Central
Asian
departments
of
the
Soviet
Union
became
independent
states
This
pattern
of
expansion
through
building
alliances
extended
to
the
United
States
Muslim
organization
called
al
Khifa
had
numerous
branch
offices
the
largest
of
which
was
in
the
Farouq
mosque
in
Brooklyn
In
the
mid-
1980s
it
had
been
set
up
as
one
of
the
first
outposts
of
Azzam
and
Bin
Ladin's
MAK
Other
cities
with
branches
of
al
Khifa
included
Atlanta
Boston
Chicago
Pittsburgh
and
Tucson
Al
Khifa
recruited
American
Muslims
to
fight
in
Afghanistan;
some
of
them
would
participate
in
terrorist
actions
in
the
United
States
in
the
early
1990s
and
in
al
Qaeda
operations
elsewhere
including
the
1998
attacks
on
U.S
embassies
in
East
Africa
BUILDING
AN
ORGANIZATION
DECLARING
WAR
ON
THE
UNITED
STATES
(1992-1996)
Bin
Ladin
began
delivering
diatribes
against
the
United
States
before
he
left
Saudi
Arabia
He
continued
to
do
so
after
he
arrived
in
Sudan
In
early
1992
the
al
Qaeda
leadership
issued
fatwa
calling
for
jihad
against
the
Western
"occupation"
of
Islamic
lands
Specifically
singling
out
U.S
forces
for
attack
the
language
resembled
that
which
would
appear
in
Bin
Ladin's
public
fatwa
in
August
1996
In
ensuing
weeks
Bin
Ladin
delivered
an
often-repeated
lecture
on
the
need
to
cut
off
"the
head
of
the
snake."
By
this
time
Bin
Ladin
was
well-known
and
senior
figure
among
Islamist
extremists
especially
those
in
Egypt
the
Arabian
Peninsula
and
the
Afghanistan-Pakistan
border
region
Still
he
was
just
one
among
many
diverse
terrorist
barons
Some
of
Bin
Ladin's
close
comrades
were
more
peers
than
subordinates
For
example
Usama
Asmurai
also
known
as
Wali
Khan
worked
with
Bin
Ladin
in
the
early
1980s
and
helped
him
in
the
Philippines
and
in
Tajikistan
The
Egyptian
spiritual
guide
based
in
New
Jersey
the
Blind
Sheikh
whom
Bin
Ladin
admired
was
also
in
the
network
Among
sympathetic
peers
in
Afghanistan
were
few
of
the
warlords
still
fighting
for
power
and
Abu
Zubaydah
who
helped
operate
popular
terrorist
training
camp
near
the
border
with
Pakistan
There
were
also
rootless
but
experienced
operatives
such
as
Ramzi
Yousef
and
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
who-though
not
necessarily
formal
members
of
someone
else's
organization-were
traveling
around
the
world
and
joining
in
projects
that
were
supported
by
or
linked
to
Bin
Ladin
the
Blind
Sheikh
or
their
associates
In
now
analyzing
the
terrorist
programs
carried
out
by
members
of
this
network
it
would
be
misleading
to
apply
the
label
"al
Qaeda
operations"
too
often
in
these
early
years
Yet
it
would
also
be
misleading
to
ignore
the
significance
of
these
connections
And
in
this
network
Bin
Ladin's
agenda
stood
out
While
his
allied
Islamist
groups
were
focused
on
local
battles
such
as
those
in
Egypt
Algeria
Bosnia
or
Chechnya
Bin
Ladin
concentrated
on
attacking
the
"far
enemy"-the
United
States
Attacks
Known
and
Suspected
After
U.S
troops
deployed
to
Somalia
in
late
1992
al
Qaeda
leaders
formulated
fatwa
demanding
their
eviction
In
December
bombs
exploded
at
two
hotels
in
Aden
where
U.S
troops
routinely
stopped
en
route
to
Somalia
killing
two
but
no
Americans
The
perpetrators
are
reported
to
have
belonged
to
group
from
southern
Yemen
headed
by
Yemeni
member
of
Bin
Ladin's
Islamic
Army
Shura;
some
in
the
group
had
trained
at
an
al
Qaeda
camp
in
Sudan
Al
Qaeda
leaders
set
up
Nairobi
cell
and
used
it
to
send
weapons
and
trainers
to
the
Somali
warlords
battling
U.S
forces
an
operation
directly
supervised
by
al
Qaeda's
military
leader
Scores
of
trainers
flowed
to
Somalia
over
the
ensuing
months
including
most
of
the
senior
members
and
weapons
training
experts
of
al
Qaeda's
military
committee
These
trainers
were
later
heard
boasting
that
their
assistance
led
to
the
October
1993
shootdown
of
two
U.S
Black
Hawk
helicopters
by
members
of
Somali
militia
group
and
to
the
subsequent
withdrawal
of
U.S
forces
in
early
1994
In
November
1995
car
bomb
exploded
outside
Saudi-U.S
joint
facility
in
Riyadh
for
training
the
Saudi
National
Guard
Five
Americans
and
two
officials
from
India
were
killed
The
Saudi
government
arrested
four
perpetrators
who
admitted
being
inspired
by
Bin
Ladin
They
were
promptly
executed
Though
nothing
proves
that
Bin
Ladin
ordered
this
attack
U.S
intelligence
subsequently
learned
that
al
Qaeda
leaders
had
decided
year
earlier
to
attack
U.S
target
in
Saudi
Arabia
and
had
shipped
explosives
to
the
peninsula
for
this
purpose
Some
of
Bin
Ladin's
associates
later
took
credit
In
June
1996
an
enormous
truck
bomb
detonated
in
the
Khobar
Towers
residential
complex
in
Dhahran
Saudi
Arabia
that
housed
U.S
Air
Force
personnel
Nineteen
Americans
were
killed
and
372
were
wounded
The
operation
was
carried
out
principally
perhaps
exclusively
by
Saudi
Hezbollah
an
organization
that
had
received
support
from
the
government
of
Iran
While
the
evidence
of
Iranian
involvement
is
strong
there
are
also
signs
that
al
Qaeda
played
some
role
as
yet
unknown
In
this
period
other
prominent
attacks
in
which
Bin
Ladin's
involvement
is
at
best
cloudy
are
the
1993
bombing
of
the
World
Trade
Center
plot
that
same
year
to
destroy
landmarks
in
New
York
and
the
1995
Manila
air
plot
to
blow
up
dozen
U.S
airliners
over
the
Pacific
Details
on
these
plots
appear
in
chapter
3
Another
scheme
revealed
that
Bin
Ladin
sought
the
capability
to
kill
on
mass
scale
His
business
aides
received
word
that
Sudanese
military
officer
who
had
been
member
of
the
previous
government
cabinet
was
offering
to
sell
weapons-grade
uranium
After
number
of
contacts
were
made
through
intermediaries
the
officer
set
the
price
at
$1.5
million
which
did
not
deter
Bin
Ladin
Al
Qaeda
representatives
asked
to
inspect
the
uranium
and
were
shown
cylinder
about
feet
long
and
one
thought
he
could
pronounce
it
genuine
Al
Qaeda
apparently
purchased
the
cylinder
then
discovered
it
to
be
bogus
But
while
the
effort
failed
it
shows
what
Bin
Ladin
and
his
associates
hoped
to
do
One
of
the
al
Qaeda
representatives
explained
his
mission:
"it's
easy
to
kill
more
people
with
uranium."
Bin
Ladin
seemed
willing
to
include
in
the
confederation
terrorists
from
almost
every
corner
of
the
Muslim
world
His
vision
mirrored
that
of
Sudan's
Islamist
leader
Turabi
who
convened
series
of
meetings
under
the
label
Popular
Arab
and
Islamic
Conference
around
the
time
of
Bin
Ladin's
arrival
in
that
country
Delegations
of
violent
Islamist
extremists
came
from
all
the
groups
represented
in
Bin
Ladin's
Islamic
Army
Shura
Representatives
also
came
from
organizations
such
as
the
Palestine
Liberation
Organization
Hamas
and
Hezbollah
Turabi
sought
to
persuade
Shiites
and
Sunnis
to
put
aside
their
divisions
and
join
against
the
common
enemy
In
late
1991
or
1992
discussions
in
Sudan
between
al
Qaeda
and
Iranian
operatives
led
to
an
informal
agreement
to
cooperate
in
providing
support-even
if
only
training-for
actions
carried
out
primarily
against
Israel
and
the
United
States
Not
long
afterward
senior
al
Qaeda
operatives
and
trainers
traveled
to
Iran
to
receive
training
in
explosives
In
the
fall
of
1993
another
such
delegation
went
to
the
Bekaa
Valley
in
Lebanon
for
further
training
in
explosives
as
well
as
in
intelligence
and
security
Bin
Ladin
reportedly
showed
particular
interest
in
learning
how
to
use
truck
bombs
such
as
the
one
that
had
killed
241
U.S
Marines
in
Lebanon
in
1983
The
relationship
between
al
Qaeda
and
Iran
demonstrated
that
Sunni-Shia
divisions
did
not
necessarily
pose
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
cooperation
in
terrorist
operations
As
will
be
described
in
chapter
7
al
Qaeda
contacts
with
Iran
continued
in
ensuing
years
Bin
Ladin
was
also
willing
to
explore
possibilities
for
cooperation
with
Iraq
even
though
Iraq's
dictator
Saddam
Hussein
had
never
had
an
Islamist
agenda-save
for
his
opportunistic
pose
as
defender
of
the
faithful
against
"Crusaders"
during
the
Gulf
War
of
1991
Moreover
Bin
Ladin
had
in
fact
been
sponsoring
anti-Saddam
Islamists
in
Iraqi
Kurdistan
and
sought
to
attract
them
into
his
Islamic
army
To
protect
his
own
ties
with
Iraq
Turabi
reportedly
brokered
an
agreement
that
Bin
Ladin
would
stop
supporting
activities
against
Saddam
Bin
Ladin
apparently
honored
this
pledge
at
least
for
time
although
he
continued
to
aid
group
of
Islamist
extremists
operating
in
part
of
Iraq
(Kurdistan)
outside
of
Baghdad's
control
In
the
late
1990s
these
extremist
groups
suffered
major
defeats
by
Kurdish
forces
In
2001
with
Bin
Ladin's
help
they
re-formed
into
an
organization
called
Ansar
al
Islam
There
are
indications
that
by
then
the
Iraqi
regime
tolerated
and
may
even
have
helped
Ansar
al
Islam
against
the
common
Kurdish
enemy
With
the
Sudanese
regime
acting
as
intermediary
Bin
Ladin
himself
met
with
senior
Iraqi
intelligence
officer
in
Khartoum
in
late
1994
or
early
1995
Bin
Ladin
is
said
to
have
asked
for
space
to
establish
training
camps
as
well
as
assistance
in
procuring
weapons
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
Iraq
responded
to
this
request
As
described
below
the
ensuing
years
saw
additional
efforts
to
establish
connections
Sudan
Becomes
Doubtful
Haven
Not
until
1998
did
al
Qaeda
undertake
major
terrorist
operation
of
its
own
in
large
part
because
Bin
Ladin
lost
his
base
in
Sudan
Ever
since
the
Islamist
regime
came
to
power
in
Khartoum
the
United
States
and
other
Western
governments
had
pressed
it
to
stop
providing
haven
for
terrorist
organizations
Other
governments
in
the
region
such
as
those
of
Egypt
Syria
Jordan
and
even
Libya
which
were
targets
of
some
of
these
groups
added
their
own
pressure
At
the
same
time
the
Sudanese
regime
began
to
change
Though
Turabi
had
been
its
inspirational
leader
General
Omar
al
Bashir
president
since
1989
had
never
been
entirely
under
his
thumb
Thus
as
outside
pressures
mounted
Bashir's
supporters
began
to
displace
those
of
Turabi
The
attempted
assassination
in
Ethiopia
of
Egyptian
President
Hosni
Mubarak
in
June
1995
appears
to
have
been
tipping
point
The
would-be
killers
who
came
from
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Group
had
been
sheltered
in
Sudan
and
helped
by
Bin
Ladin
When
the
Sudanese
refused
to
hand
over
three
individuals
identified
as
involved
in
the
assassination
plot
the
UN
Security
Council
passed
resolution
criticizing
their
inaction
and
eventually
sanctioned
Khartoum
in
April
1996
clear
signal
to
Bin
Ladin
that
his
days
in
Sudan
were
numbered
came
when
the
government
advised
him
that
it
intended
to
yield
to
Libya's
demands
to
stop
giving
sanctuary
to
its
enemies
Bin
Ladin
had
to
tell
the
Libyans
who
had
been
part
of
his
Islamic
army
that
he
could
no
longer
protect
them
and
that
they
had
to
leave
the
country
Outraged
several
Libyan
members
of
al
Qaeda
and
the
Islamic
Army
Shura
renounced
all
connections
with
him
Bin
Ladin
also
began
to
have
serious
money
problems
International
pressure
on
Sudan
together
with
strains
in
the
world
economy
hurt
Sudan's
currency
Some
of
Bin
Ladin's
companies
ran
short
of
funds
As
Sudanese
authorities
became
less
obliging
normal
costs
of
doing
business
increased
Saudi
pressures
on
the
Bin
Ladin
family
also
probably
took
some
toll
In
any
case
Bin
Ladin
found
it
necessary
both
to
cut
back
his
spending
and
to
control
his
outlays
more
closely
He
appointed
new
financial
manager
whom
his
followers
saw
as
miserly
Money
problems
proved
costly
to
Bin
Ladin
in
other
ways
Jamal
Ahmed
al
Fadl
Sudanese-born
Arab
had
spent
time
in
the
United
States
and
had
been
recruited
for
the
Afghan
war
through
the
Farouq
mosque
in
Brooklyn
He
had
joined
al
Qaeda
and
taken
the
oath
of
fealty
to
Bin
Ladin
serving
as
one
of
his
business
agents
Then
Bin
Ladin
discovered
that
Fadl
had
skimmed
about
$110,000
and
he
asked
for
restitution
Fadl
resented
receiving
salary
of
only
$500
month
while
some
of
the
Egyptians
in
al
Qaeda
were
given
$1,200
month
He
defected
and
became
star
informant
for
the
United
States
Also
testifying
about
al
Qaeda
in
U.S
court
was
L'Houssaine
Kherchtou
who
told
of
breaking
with
Bin
Ladin
because
of
Bin
Ladin's
professed
inability
to
provide
him
with
money
when
his
wife
needed
caesarian
section
In
February
1996
Sudanese
officials
began
approaching
officials
from
the
United
States
and
other
governments
asking
what
actions
of
theirs
might
ease
foreign
pressure
In
secret
meetings
with
Saudi
officials
Sudan
offered
to
expel
Bin
Ladin
to
Saudi
Arabia
and
asked
the
Saudis
to
pardon
him
U.S
officials
became
aware
of
these
secret
discussions
certainly
by
March
Saudi
officials
apparently
wanted
Bin
Ladin
expelled
from
Sudan
They
had
already
revoked
his
citizenship
however
and
would
not
tolerate
his
presence
in
their
country
And
Bin
Ladin
may
have
no
longer
felt
safe
in
Sudan
where
he
had
already
escaped
at
least
one
assassination
attempt
that
he
believed
to
have
been
the
work
of
the
Egyptian
or
Saudi
regimes
or
both
In
any
case
on
May
19
1996
Bin
Ladin
left
Sudan-significantly
weakened
despite
his
ambitions
and
organizational
skills
He
returned
to
Afghanistan
AL
QAEDA'S
RENEWAL
IN
AFGHANISTAN
(1996-1998)
Bin
Ladin
flew
on
leased
aircraft
from
Khartoum
to
Jalalabad
with
refueling
stopover
in
the
United
Arab
Emirates
He
was
accompanied
by
family
members
and
bodyguards
as
well
as
by
al
Qaeda
members
who
had
been
close
associates
since
his
organization's
1988
founding
in
Afghanistan
Dozens
of
additional
militants
arrived
on
later
flights
Though
Bin
Ladin's
destination
was
Afghanistan
Pakistan
was
the
nation
that
held
the
key
to
his
ability
to
use
Afghanistan
as
base
from
which
to
revive
his
ambitious
enterprise
for
war
against
the
United
States
For
the
first
quarter
century
of
its
existence
as
nation
Pakistan's
identity
had
derived
from
Islam
but
its
politics
had
been
decidedly
secular
The
army
was-and
remains-the
country's
strongest
and
most
respected
institution
and
the
army
had
been
and
continues
to
be
preoccupied
with
its
rivalry
with
India
especially
over
the
disputed
territory
of
Kashmir
From
the
1970s
onward
religion
had
become
an
increasingly
powerful
force
in
Pakistani
politics
After
coup
in
1977
military
leaders
turned
to
Islamist
groups
for
support
and
fundamentalists
became
more
prominent
South
Asia
had
an
indigenous
form
of
Islamic
fundamentalism
which
had
developed
in
the
nineteenth
century
at
school
in
the
Indian
village
of
Deoband
The
influence
of
the
Wahhabi
school
of
Islam
had
also
grown
nurtured
by
Saudifunded
institutions
Moreover
the
fighting
in
Afghanistan
made
Pakistan
home
to
an
enormous-and
generally
unwelcome-population
of
Afghan
refugees;
and
since
the
badly
strained
Pakistani
education
system
could
not
accommodate
the
refugees
the
government
increasingly
let
privately
funded
religious
schools
serve
as
cost-free
alternative
Over
time
these
schools
produced
large
numbers
of
half-educated
young
men
with
no
marketable
skills
but
with
deeply
held
Islamic
views
Pakistan's
rulers
found
these
multitudes
of
ardent
young
Afghans
source
of
potential
trouble
at
home
but
potentially
useful
abroad
Those
who
joined
the
Taliban
movement
espousing
ruthless
version
of
Islamic
law
perhaps
could
bring
order
in
chaotic
Afghanistan
and
make
it
cooperative
ally
They
thus
might
give
Pakistan
greater
security
on
one
of
the
several
borders
where
Pakistani
military
officers
hoped
for
what
they
called
"strategic
depth."
It
is
unlikely
that
Bin
Ladin
could
have
returned
to
Afghanistan
had
Pakistan
disapproved
The
Pakistani
military
intelligence
service
probably
had
advance
knowledge
of
his
coming
and
its
officers
may
have
facilitated
his
travel
During
his
entire
time
in
Sudan
he
had
maintained
guesthouses
and
training
camps
in
Pakistan
and
Afghanistan
These
were
part
of
larger
network
used
by
diverse
organizations
for
recruiting
and
training
fighters
for
Islamic
insurgencies
in
such
places
as
Tajikistan
Kashmir
and
Chechnya
Pakistani
intelligence
officers
reportedly
introduced
Bin
Ladin
to
Taliban
leaders
in
Kandahar
their
main
base
of
power
to
aid
his
reassertion
of
control
over
camps
near
Khowst
out
of
an
apparent
hope
that
he
would
now
expand
the
camps
and
make
them
available
for
training
Kashmiri
militants
Yet
Bin
Ladin
was
in
his
weakest
position
since
his
early
days
in
the
war
against
the
Soviet
Union
The
Sudanese
government
had
canceled
the
registration
of
the
main
business
enterprises
he
had
set
up
there
and
then
put
some
of
them
up
for
public
sale
According
to
senior
al
Qaeda
detainee
the
government
of
Sudan
seized
everything
Bin
Ladin
had
possessed
there
He
also
lost
the
head
of
his
military
committee
Abu
Ubaidah
al
Banshiri
one
of
the
most
capable
and
popular
leaders
of
al
Qaeda
While
most
of
the
group's
key
figures
had
accompanied
Bin
Ladin
to
Afghanistan
Banshiri
had
remained
in
Kenya
to
oversee
the
training
and
weapons
shipments
of
the
cell
set
up
some
four
years
earlier
He
died
in
ferryboat
accident
on
Lake
Victoria
just
few
days
after
Bin
Ladin
arrived
in
Jalalabad
leaving
Bin
Ladin
with
need
to
replace
him
not
only
in
the
Shura
but
also
as
supervisor
of
the
cells
and
prospective
operations
in
East
Africa
He
had
to
make
other
adjustments
as
well
for
some
al
Qaeda
members
viewed
Bin
Ladin's
return
to
Afghanistan
as
occasion
to
go
off
in
their
own
directions
Some
maintained
collaborative
relationships
with
al
Qaeda
but
many
disengaged
entirely
For
time
it
may
not
have
been
clear
to
Bin
Ladin
that
the
Taliban
would
be
his
best
bet
as
an
ally
When
he
arrived
in
Afghanistan
they
controlled
much
of
the
country
but
key
centers
including
Kabul
were
still
held
by
rival
warlords
Bin
Ladin
went
initially
to
Jalalabad
probably
because
it
was
in
an
area
controlled
by
provincial
council
of
Islamic
leaders
who
were
not
major
contenders
for
national
power
He
found
lodgings
with
Younis
Khalis
the
head
of
one
of
the
main
mujahideen
factions
Bin
Ladin
apparently
kept
his
options
open
maintaining
contacts
with
Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar
who
though
an
Islamic
extremist
was
also
one
of
the
Taliban's
most
militant
opponents
But
after
September
1996
when
first
Jalalabad
and
then
Kabul
fell
to
the
Taliban
Bin
Ladin
cemented
his
ties
with
them
That
process
did
not
always
go
smoothly
Bin
Ladin
no
longer
constrained
by
the
Sudanese
clearly
thought
that
he
had
new
freedom
to
publish
his
appeals
for
jihad
At
about
the
time
when
the
Taliban
were
making
their
final
drive
toward
Jalalabad
and
Kabul
Bin
Ladin
issued
his
August
1996
fatwa
saying
that
"We
have
been
prevented
from
addressing
the
Muslims,"
but
expressing
relief
that
"by
the
grace
of
Allah
safe
base
here
is
now
available
in
the
high
Hindu
Kush
mountains
in
Khurasan."
But
theTaliban
like
the
Sudanese
would
eventually
hear
warnings
including
from
the
Saudi
monarchy
Though
Bin
Ladin
had
promised
Taliban
leaders
that
he
would
be
circumspect
he
broke
this
promise
almost
immediately
giving
an
inflammatory
interview
to
CNN
in
March
1997
The
Taliban
leader
Mullah
Omar
promptly
"invited"
Bin
Ladin
to
move
to
Kandahar
ostensibly
in
the
interests
of
Bin
Ladin's
own
security
but
more
likely
to
situate
him
where
he
might
be
easier
to
control
There
is
also
evidence
that
around
this
time
Bin
Ladin
sent
out
number
of
feelers
to
the
Iraqi
regime
offering
some
cooperation
None
are
reported
to
have
received
significant
response
According
to
one
report
Saddam
Hussein's
efforts
at
this
time
to
rebuild
relations
with
the
Saudis
and
other
Middle
Eastern
regimes
led
him
to
stay
clear
of
Bin
Ladin
In
mid-1998
the
situation
reversed;
it
was
Iraq
that
reportedly
took
the
initiative
In
March
1998
after
Bin
Ladin's
public
fatwa
against
the
United
States
two
al
Qaeda
members
reportedly
went
to
Iraq
to
meet
with
Iraqi
intelligence
In
July
an
Iraqi
delegation
traveled
to
Afghanistan
to
meet
first
with
the
Taliban
and
then
with
Bin
Ladin
Sources
reported
that
one
or
perhaps
both
of
these
meetings
was
apparently
arranged
through
Bin
Ladin's
Egyptian
deputy
Zawahiri
who
had
ties
of
his
own
to
the
Iraqis
In
1998
Iraq
was
under
intensifying
U.S
pressure
which
culminated
in
series
of
large
air
attacks
in
December
Similar
meetings
between
Iraqi
officials
and
Bin
Ladin
or
his
aides
may
have
occurred
in
1999
during
period
of
some
reported
strains
with
the
Taliban
According
to
the
reporting
Iraqi
officials
offered
Bin
Ladin
safe
haven
in
Iraq
Bin
Ladin
declined
apparently
judging
that
his
circumstances
in
Afghanistan
remained
more
favorable
than
the
Iraqi
alternative
The
reports
describe
friendly
contacts
and
indicate
some
common
themes
in
both
sides'
hatred
of
the
United
States
But
to
date
we
have
seen
no
evidence
that
these
or
the
earlier
contacts
ever
developed
into
collaborative
operational
relationship
Nor
have
we
seen
evidence
indicating
that
Iraq
cooperated
with
al
Qaeda
in
developing
or
carrying
out
any
attacks
against
the
United
States
Bin
Ladin
eventually
enjoyed
strong
financial
position
in
Afghanistan
thanks
to
Saudi
and
other
financiers
associated
with
the
Golden
Chain
Through
his
relationship
with
Mullah
Omar-and
the
monetary
and
other
benefits
that
it
brought
the
Taliban-Bin
Ladin
was
able
to
circumvent
restrictions;
Mullah
Omar
would
stand
by
him
even
when
otherTaliban
leaders
raised
objections
Bin
Ladin
appeared
to
have
in
Afghanistan
freedom
of
movement
that
he
had
lacked
in
Sudan
Al
Qaeda
members
could
travel
freely
within
the
country
enter
and
exit
it
without
visas
or
any
immigration
procedures
purchase
and
import
vehicles
and
weapons
and
enjoy
the
use
of
official
Afghan
Ministry
of
Defense
license
plates
Al
Qaeda
also
used
the
Afghan
state-owned
Ariana
Airlines
to
courier
money
into
the
country
The
Taliban
seemed
to
open
the
doors
to
all
who
wanted
to
come
to
Afghanistan
to
train
in
the
camps
The
alliance
with
theTaliban
provided
al
Qaeda
sanctuary
in
which
to
train
and
indoctrinate
fighters
and
terrorists
import
weapons
forge
ties
with
other
jihad
groups
and
leaders
and
plot
and
staff
terrorist
schemes
While
Bin
Ladin
maintained
his
own
al
Qaeda
guesthouses
and
camps
for
vetting
and
training
recruits
he
also
provided
support
to
and
benefited
from
the
broad
infrastructure
of
such
facilities
in
Afghanistan
made
available
to
the
global
network
of
Islamist
movements
U.S
intelligence
estimates
put
the
total
number
of
fighters
who
underwent
instruction
in
Bin
Ladin-supported
camps
in
Afghanistan
from
1996
through
9/11
at
10,000
to
20,000
In
addition
to
training
fighters
and
special
operators
this
larger
network
of
guesthouses
and
camps
provided
mechanism
by
which
al
Qaeda
could
screen
and
vet
candidates
for
induction
into
its
own
organization
Thousands
flowed
through
the
camps
but
no
more
than
few
hundred
seem
to
have
become
al
Qaeda
members
From
the
time
of
its
founding
al
Qaeda
had
employed
training
and
indoctrination
to
identify
"worthy"
candidates
Al
Qaeda
continued
meanwhile
to
collaborate
closely
with
the
many
Middle
Eastern
groups-in
Egypt
Algeria
Yemen
Lebanon
Morocco
Tunisia
Somalia
and
elsewhere-with
which
it
had
been
linked
when
Bin
Ladin
was
in
Sudan
It
also
reinforced
its
London
base
and
its
other
offices
around
Europe
the
Balkans
and
the
Caucasus
Bin
Ladin
bolstered
his
links
to
extremists
in
South
and
Southeast
Asia
including
the
Malaysian-Indonesian
JI
and
several
Pakistani
groups
engaged
in
the
Kashmir
conflict
The
February
1998
fatwa
thus
seems
to
have
been
kind
of
public
launch
of
renewed
and
stronger
al
Qaeda
after
year
and
half
of
work
Having
rebuilt
his
fund-raising
network
Bin
Ladin
had
again
become
the
rich
man
of
the
jihad
movement
He
had
maintained
or
restored
many
of
his
links
with
terrorists
elsewhere
in
the
world
And
he
had
strengthened
the
internal
ties
in
his
own
organization
The
inner
core
of
al
Qaeda
continued
to
be
hierarchical
top-down
group
with
defined
positions
tasks
and
salaries
Most
but
not
all
in
this
core
swore
fealty
(or
bayat)
to
Bin
Ladin
Other
operatives
were
committed
to
Bin
Ladin
or
to
his
goals
and
would
take
assignments
for
him
but
they
did
not
swear
bayat
and
maintained
or
tried
to
maintain
some
autonomy
looser
circle
of
adherents
might
give
money
to
al
Qaeda
or
train
in
its
camps
but
remained
essentially
independent
Nevertheless
they
constituted
potential
resource
for
al
Qaeda
Now
effectively
merged
with
Zawahiri's
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
al
Qaeda
promised
to
become
the
general
headquarters
for
international
terrorism
without
the
need
for
the
Islamic
Army
Shura
Bin
Ladin
was
prepared
to
pick
up
where
he
had
left
off
in
Sudan
He
was
ready
to
strike
at
"the
head
of
the
snake."
Al
Qaeda's
role
in
organizing
terrorist
operations
had
also
changed
Before
the
move
to
Afghanistan
it
had
concentrated
on
providing
funds
training
and
weapons
for
actions
carried
out
by
members
of
allied
groups
The
attacks
on
the
U.S
embassies
in
East
Africa
in
the
summer
of
1998
would
take
different
form-planned
directed
and
executed
by
al
Qaeda
under
the
direct
supervision
of
Bin
Ladin
and
his
chief
aides
The
Embassy
Bombings
As
early
as
December
1993
team
of
al
Qaeda
operatives
had
begun
casing
targets
in
Nairobi
for
future
attacks
It
was
led
by
Ali
Mohamed
former
Egyptian
army
officer
who
had
moved
to
the
United
States
in
the
mid-1980s
enlisted
in
the
U.S
Army
and
became
an
instructor
at
Fort
Bragg
He
had
provided
guidance
and
training
to
extremists
at
the
Farouq
mosque
in
Brooklyn
including
some
who
were
subsequently
convicted
in
the
February
1993
attack
on
the
World
Trade
Center
The
casing
team
also
included
computer
expert
whose
write-ups
were
reviewed
by
al
Qaeda
leaders
The
team
set
up
makeshift
laboratory
for
developing
their
surveillance
photographs
in
an
apartment
in
Nairobi
where
the
various
al
Qaeda
operatives
and
leaders
based
in
or
traveling
to
the
Kenya
cell
sometimes
met
Banshiri
al
Qaeda's
military
committee
chief
continued
to
be
the
operational
commander
of
the
cell;
but
because
he
was
constantly
on
the
move
Bin
Ladin
had
dispatched
another
operative
Khaled
al
Fawwaz
to
serve
as
the
on-site
manager
The
technical
surveillance
and
communications
equipment
employed
for
these
casing
missions
included
state-of-the-art
video
cameras
obtained
from
China
and
from
dealers
in
Germany
The
casing
team
also
reconnoitered
targets
in
Djibouti
As
early
as
January
1994
Bin
Ladin
received
the
surveillance
reports
complete
with
diagrams
prepared
by
the
team's
computer
specialist
He
his
top
military
committee
members-Banshiri
and
his
deputy
Abu
Hafs
al
Masri
(also
known
as
Mohammed
Atef)-and
number
of
other
al
Qaeda
leaders
reviewed
the
reports
Agreeing
that
the
U.S
embassy
in
Nairobi
was
an
easy
target
because
car
bomb
could
be
parked
close
by
they
began
to
form
plan
Al
Qaeda
had
begun
developing
the
tactical
expertise
for
such
attacks
months
earlier
when
some
of
its
operatives-top
military
committee
members
and
several
operatives
who
were
involved
with
the
Kenya
cell
among
them-were
sent
to
Hezbollah
training
camps
in
Lebanon
The
cell
in
Kenya
experienced
series
of
disruptions
that
may
in
part
account
for
the
relatively
long
delay
before
the
attack
was
actually
carried
out
The
difficulties
Bin
Ladin
began
to
encounter
in
Sudan
in
1995
his
move
to
Afghanistan
in
1996
and
the
months
spent
establishing
ties
with
the
Taliban
may
also
have
played
role
as
did
Banshiri's
accidental
drowning
In
August
1997
the
Kenya
cell
panicked
The
London
Daily
Telegraph
reported
that
Madani
al
Tayyib
formerly
head
of
al
Qaeda's
finance
committee
had
turned
himself
over
to
the
Saudi
government
The
article
said
(incorrectly)
that
the
Saudis
were
sharing
Tayyib's
information
with
the
U.S
and
British
authorities
At
almost
the
same
time
cell
members
learned
that
U.S
and
Kenyan
agents
had
searched
the
Kenya
residence
of
Wadi
al
Hage
who
had
become
the
new
on-site
manager
in
Nairobi
and
that
Hage's
telephone
was
being
tapped
Hage
was
U.S.citizen
who
had
worked
with
Bin
Ladin
in
Afghanistan
in
the
1980s
and
in
1992
he
went
to
Sudan
to
become
one
of
al
Qaeda's
major
financial
operatives
When
Hage
returned
to
the
United
States
to
appear
before
grand
jury
investigating
Bin
Ladin
the
job
of
cell
manager
was
taken
over
by
Harun
Fazul
Kenyan
citizen
who
had
been
in
Bin
Ladin's
advance
team
to
Sudan
back
in
1990
Harun
faxed
report
on
the
"security
situation"
to
several
sites
warning
that
"the
crew
members
in
East
Africa
is
[sic]
in
grave
danger"
in
part
because
"America
knows
that
the
followers
of
[Bin
Ladin]
carried
out
the
operations
to
hit
Americans
in
Somalia."
The
report
provided
instructions
for
avoiding
further
exposure
On
February
23
1998
Bin
Ladin
issued
his
public
fatwa
The
language
had
been
in
negotiation
for
some
time
as
part
of
the
merger
under
way
between
Bin
Ladin's
organization
and
Zawahiri's
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
Less
than
month
after
the
publication
of
the
fatwa
the
teams
that
were
to
carry
out
the
embassy
attacks
were
being
pulled
together
in
Nairobi
and
Dar
es
Salaam
The
timing
and
content
of
their
instructions
indicate
that
the
decision
to
launch
the
attacks
had
been
made
by
the
time
the
fatwa
was
issued
The
next
four
months
were
spent
setting
up
the
teams
in
Nairobi
and
Dar
es
Salaam
Members
of
the
cells
rented
residences
and
purchased
bomb-making
materials
and
transport
vehicles
At
least
one
additional
explosives
expert
was
brought
in
to
assist
in
putting
the
weapons
together
In
Nairobi
hotel
room
was
rented
to
put
up
some
of
the
operatives
The
suicide
trucks
were
purchased
shortly
before
the
attack
date
While
this
was
taking
place
Bin
Ladin
continued
to
push
his
public
message
On
May
7
the
deputy
head
of
al
Qaeda's
military
committee
Mohammed
Atef
faxed
to
Bin
Ladin's
London
office
new
fatwa
issued
by
group
of
sheikhs
located
in
Afghanistan
week
later
it
appeared
in
Al
Quds
al
Arabi
the
same
Arabic-language
newspaper
in
London
that
had
first
published
Bin
Ladin's
February
fatwa
and
it
conveyed
the
same
message-the
duty
of
Muslims
to
carry
out
holy
war
against
the
enemies
of
Islam
and
to
expel
the
Americans
from
the
Gulf
region
Two
weeks
after
that
Bin
Ladin
gave
videotaped
interview
to
ABC
News
with
the
same
slogans
adding
that
"we
do
not
differentiate
between
those
dressed
in
military
uniforms
and
civilians;
they
are
all
targets
in
this
fatwa."
By
August
1
members
of
the
cells
not
directly
involved
in
the
attacks
had
mostly
departed
from
East
Africa
The
remaining
operatives
prepared
and
assembled
the
bombs
and
acquired
the
delivery
vehicles
On
August
4
they
made
one
last
casing
run
at
the
embassy
in
Nairobi
By
the
evening
of
August
6
all
but
the
delivery
teams
and
one
or
two
persons
assigned
to
remove
the
evidence
trail
had
left
East
Africa
Back
in
Afghanistan
Bin
Ladin
and
the
al
Qaeda
leadership
had
left
Kandahar
for
the
countryside
expecting
U.S
retaliation
Declarations
taking
credit
for
the
attacks
had
already
been
faxed
to
the
joint
al
Qaeda-Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
office
in
Baku
with
instructions
to
stand
by
for
orders
to
"instantly"
transmit
them
to
Al
Quds
al
Arabi
One
proclaimed
"the
formation
of
the
Islamic
Army
for
the
Liberation
of
the
Holy
Places,"
and
two
others-one
for
each
embassy-announced
that
the
attack
had
been
carried
out
by
"company"
of
"battalion"
of
this
"Islamic
Army."
On
the
morning
of
August
7
the
bomb-laden
trucks
drove
into
the
embassies
roughly
five
minutes
apart-about
10:35
A.M
in
Nairobi
and
10:39
A.M
in
Dar
es
Salaam
Shortly
afterward
phone
call
was
placed
from
Baku
to
London
The
previously
prepared
messages
were
then
faxed
to
London
The
attack
on
the
U.S
embassy
in
Nairobi
destroyed
the
embassy
and
killed
12
Americans
and
201
others
almost
all
Kenyans
About
5,000
people
were
injured
The
attack
on
the
U.S
embassy
in
Dar
es
Salaam
killed
11
more
people
none
of
them
Americans
Interviewed
later
about
the
deaths
of
the
Africans
Bin
Ladin
answered
that
"when
it
becomes
apparent
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
repel
these
Americans
without
assaulting
them
even
if
this
involved
the
killing
of
Muslims
this
is
permissible
under
Islam."
Asked
if
he
had
indeed
masterminded
these
bombings
Bin
Ladin
said
that
the
World
Islamic
Front
for
jihad
against
"Jews
and
Crusaders"
had
issued
"crystal
clear"
fatwa
If
the
instigation
for
jihad
against
the
Jews
and
the
Americans
to
liberate
the
holy
places
"is
considered
crime,"he
said,"let
history
be
witness
that
am
criminal."

Amsterdam
is
gold
mine
for
those
who
like
to
browse
The
city
has
thankfully
not
yet
been
taken
over
by
the
international
chain
stores
and
the
narrow
streets
of
the
center
the
canal
rings
and
the
Jordaan
area
are
home
to
myriad
small
independent
boutiquesÂ âÂ here
you

wander
for
hours
in

of
that

The
nearest
street
you
have
to
âinternationalâ
shopping
Kalverstraat
is
home
to
the
young
fashion
outlets
and
department
stores
Amsterdammers
love
to
shop
for
their
homes
Although
many
live
in
small
apartments
what
they
lack
in
square
footage
they
make
up
for

of
their

selling
pretty
household

The
Streets
The
â9

markets
cater
to
those

by
no
means
place
to
find

Perhaps
the
most
famous
market
in
Amsterdam
is
the
Bloemenmarkt

everyday

also
has
an
international
reputation
although
the
market
is
much
smaller
since
the
building
of
the
Muziek
Theater
Many
stall

have
moved

are
dealers
in
almost
every
different
specialist
area
This
is
not
place
for
amateur
collectors;
prices
are
high
but
so
is
quality
the
expertise
of
the
dealers
and
the
advice
which
they

Many
of
the

Art
The
lure
of
the
city
for
creative
people
has
existed
for
centuries
and
modern
artists
follow
in
the
wake
of
Rembrandt
and
the
Dutch
masters
Dozens
of
small
galleries
offer
everything
from
classical
to
pop
art
Exhibitions
at
the
major
galleries
also
promote
the
work
of
up
and
coming
younger
artists
as
well
as
established
names
Street
art
is
also
very
much
in
evidence
especially
in
the
summer
For
those
who
enjoy
the
literal
form
of
art
paintings
and
prints
of
windmills
or
canal
houses
can
be
found
all
across

Diamonds
Before
WWII
Amsterdam
was
major
center
for
the
buying
and
polishing
of
diamonds
The
industry
was
decimated
by
the
loss
of
many
Jewish
families
who
ran
the
major
diamond
houses
but
slow
recovery
ensured
its
survival
Today
the
industry
is
known
for
the
quality
of
its
polishing
and
of
the
expertise
of
many
independent
traders
Five
main
diamond
houses
are
responsible
for
buying
and
polishing
stones
They
sell
to
smaller
dealers
but
also
sell
to
the
public
Youâll
be
able
to
see
diamond
polishers
at
work
before
you
buy
You
can
choose
from
loose
stones
or
finished
pieces
of
jewelry
There
are
five
main
diamond
houses
in
the
city:

Plants
The
Netherlands
are
famed
world-wide
for
their
flowers
and
particularly
the
beautiful
spring
displays
in
the
fields

Amsterdam
Yet
blooms
are
produced
all
year
in
hothouses
scattered
across
the
countryside
and
can
be
purchased
at
the
Bloemenmarkt
on
the
Singel
In
addition
to
fresh
flowers
you
can
also
buy
bulbs
to
take
home
The
streets
of
Amsterdam
have
many
independent
florists
with
imaginative
ideas
in
fresh
and
dried
flowers
Even
if
you
donât
buy
it
will
inspire
you
for
your
return
home

wonderful
souvenirsÂ âÂ and
excellent

smaller
number
of
basic
elements
is
documented
as
far
back
as
the
golden
age
of
Greece
Today
we
are
accustomed
to
thinking
of
elements
and

as
one
and
the
same;
to
the
Greeks
atoms
and
elements
represented
efforts
by
different
philosophic
schools
to
explain
the
discrepancy
between
appearances
and
the
true
nature
of
things
According
to
Aristotle
it
was
the

Empedocles
(484-424
B.C.E.)
who
first
argued
that
everything
was
fundamentally
reducible
to

Greek
atomism

and
457
B.C.E.)
maintained
that
despite
our
sense
perceptions
in
reality
there
are
only
atoms
and
the

Aristotle
says
that
Democritus
conceived
atomsâthe
word
means

(Greek
a-
not-

being

Although
the
four-elements
paradigm
remained
robust
throughout
antiquity
and
through
the
Middle
Ages
(during
which
mystical
tradition
emerged
proposing
fifth
element
ruling
the
others
the
socalled
quintessence
)
atomism
fell
out
of
favor
for
nearly
two
millennia
until
the
quantitative
philosophy
of
the
early
Enlightenment
created
conceptual
environment
friendly
to
the
metamorphosis
of
alchemy
through
the
chemical
experiments
of
Robert
Hooke
Isaac
Newton
Joseph
Priestley
Henry
Cavendish
Antoine
Lavoisier
and
others
into
something
like
the
chemistry
we
were
all
taught
in
high
school
The
scientist's
prejudice
to
be
sure
sometimes
impeded
saving
the
phenomenon
(as
the
Greeks
aptly
called
experimental
observation)
The
year
before
the
outbreak
of
the
American
Revolution
Priestley
succeeded
in
removing
from
air
so
he
thought
the
substance
called
phlogiston
which
was
thought
to
be
what
put
fires
out
and
dubbed
his
dephlogisticated
air
oxygen
because
he
supposed
it
to
be
an
essential
ingredient
of
acids
(Greek
oxy
-
sharpâas
in
oxymoron
âplus
gen
related
to
the
verb
gignomai
become
happen
am
born)
Cavendish
was
much
closer
to
his
own
mark:
in
1766
he
isolated
hydrogen
which
he
correctly
perceived
as
building
block
of
water
hydro-
being
the
oblique
stem
of
Greek
hyder
water)
In
many
instances
finding
an
element
was
simply
matter
of
recognizing
that
it
was
an
element
and
not
compound
and
had
been
lying
around
people's
mines
and
workshops
since
antiquity
In
place
of
the
alchemical
signs
still
common
through
Newton's
day
in
the
notation
of
chemical
reactions
elements
got
assigned
symbols
of
one
or
two
letters
often
drawn
from
the
Latin
names
for
the
same
substances
because
Latin
remained
the
common
tongue
for
scholarly
communication
across
national
and
linguistic
borders
until
well
into
the
19th
century
Thus
the
sign
for
iron
became
Fe
(from
Latin
ferrum
)
for
gold
Au
aurum
)
for
silver
Ag
argentum
)
for
copper
Cu
(cuprum)

Other
symbols
are
less
straightforward
Sodiumâthe
name
is
derived
from
soda
originally
an
Italian
term
for
ash
used
in
glassmaking
and
later
applied
to
number
of
sodium
saltsâis
Na
short
for
natron
or
natrium
neo-latinate
term
also
applied
to
variety
of
sodium
compounds
Because
it
has
the
same
number
of
free
electrons
as
hydrogen
sodium
is
useful
in
great
many
compounds
as
substitute
for
one
of
the
two
atoms
of
hydrogen
(also
valence
1)
in
variety
of
acids
Thus
jewelers'
pickling
solution
used
to
dissolve
surface
sulfides
from
precious
metals
and
marketed
under
such
trade
names
as
Dixcel
or
Sparex
is
sodium
hyposulfate
(NaHSO4;)
far
less
corrosive
than
the
sulfuric
acid
it
replaced
in

use
Other
common
sodium
compounds
are
NaHCO3
(sodium
bicarbonate
or
baking
soda
mentioned
above)
NaCl
(sodium
chloride
or
common
table
salt;
chlorine
is
so
called
because
in
its
gaseous
form
it
is
greenâ
Greek
chlor-
as
in
chlorophyl
which
vulgar
euphemism
for

notwithstanding
is
what
really
makes
the

NaOH
(sodium
hydroxide
commonly
known
as
caustic
soda
or
lye)
and
NaNO3
(sodium
nitrate
sometimes
called
Chile
saltpeter)
common
substitute
for
sodium
when
the
latter
is
contraindicated
(e.g
for
heart
conditions)
is
potassium
(from
potash)
whose
valence
is
also
and
whose
symbol
is
K
from
late
Latin
kalium
word
of
dubious
etymology
(For
what
it's
worth
Greek
kalia
means
birdhouse
little
shed
wooden
shrineâ
such
as
would
cover
an
outdoor
divinty's
statue.)
Unlike
sodium
free
potassium
reacts
violently
with
water
liberating
gaseous
hydrogen
but
like
sodium
potassium
is
rarely
free
and
much
more
apt
to
be
encountered
in
compounds
Potassium
iodide
can
be
used
at
dinner
as
salt
substitute;
Morton
salt
includes
significant
amounts
of
it
as
an
additive
because
iodine
(like
chlorine
valence-1
halogen
and
gas
in
its
natural
state)
is
necessary
to
the
proper
functioning
of
our
thyroid
glands
Potassium
chloride
(KCl)
on
the
other
hand
can
be
made
to
react
with
Chile
saltpeter
(see
above)
to
produce
true
saltpeter:
potassium
nitrate
(KNO3)
an
essential
ingredient
of
gunpowder
whose
other
two
components
are
sulfur
and
carbon;
the
three
can
be
combined
to
explosive
effect
in
as
simple
proportions
by
weight
as
1
2
and
respectively
(Do
not
try
this
at
home.)
There
is
also
compound
called
wall
saltpeter
because
it
can
leach
out
of
the
mortar
between
the
bricks
of
damp
walls:
calcium
nitrate
(CaNO3)
Calcium
has
valence
of
2
so
it
can
substitute
in
many
molecule
for
two
atoms
of
potassium
sodium
or
hydrogen
or
some
combination
of
them;
its
name
derives
from
Latin
calx
which
means
both
limeâthe
substance
not
the
fruitâand
heelbone
The
association
of
lime
and
bones
is
not
accidental:
Limestone
(calcium
carbonate
CaCO3)
is
nothing
but
the
fossilized
skeletons
of
tiny
sea
animals
and
calcium
is
the
principal
ingredient
of
bone;
when
Shakespeare
wrote
in
The
Tempest
that
Of
his
bones
are
coral
made
he
stated
truer
fact
of
nature
than
he
may
have
known
Other
ubiquitous
calcium
compounds
include
gypsumâcalcium
sulfate
(CaSO4;)
which
is
what
sheetrock
is
made
ofâ
and
the
active
binding
agent
in
cement
quicklimeâ
Calcium

(CaO)

the
name
of
the
town
in
Ireland
by
which
the
doggerel
verse-form
is
called
as
well
)
Quicklime
is
quick
(that
is
alive
as
in
the
quick
and
the
dead)
because
it
is
anhydrous
(Greek
for
unwatered)
and
soaks
up
water
with
vengeance
to
make
slaked
lime
(calcium
hydroxide
Ca(OH)2
from
CaO
H2O)
which
is
what
makes
quicklime
so
useful
as
the
binding
agent
in

and
concrete
Some
elements
bear
macaronic
labels:
one
which
has
name
from
Greek
but
symbol
from
Latin
is
antimony
(refined

early
as
900
C.E

which

Antimony
is
so
called
from
Greek
antimonos
against
single(ness)
owing
to
its
readiness
to
react
with
other
substances
but
its
chemical
symbol
is
Sb
from
Latin
stibium
the
name
of

Most
of
the
elements
discovered
in
the
first
exuberant
wave
of
Enlightenment
chemistry
bear
abbreviations
close
to
their
actual
names:
Ni
for
nickel
first
identified
in
1751
(an
abbreviation
of
German
Kupfernickel
copper-demon
so
called
because
miners
first
noticed
it
as
stubborn
adulterant
of
copper
ore)
Al
for
aluminumâspelled
alumin
um
in
the
British
Commonwealth
nations
(named
in
1825
from
Latin
alumen
astringent
substance)
Co
for
cobalt
(isolated
in
1735;
the
name
is
variant
of
German
Kobold
kind
of

But
there
are
few
curve

here
as
well
such
as
tungsten
(from
tung
sten
Swedish
for

first
discovered
in

Apart

once
the
carbon
is
captured
in
living
organism
such
as
tree
This
permits
means
of
reasonably
accurate
dating
which
has
been
boon
to
archeologists.)
Four
decades
later
Dmitri
Mendeleev
systematized
the
table
to
show
stacks
of
elements
with
similar
properties
(e.g
the
interchangeability
of
the
numbers
of
hydrogen
lithium
sodium
and
potassium
atoms
in
molecules
such
as
sulfates
and
hydroxides:
The
sodium
atom
in
lyeâNaOHâcould
just
as
well
be
replaced
by
second
hydrogen
making
hydrogen
hydroxideâHOH
better
known
as
H2O
or
water)
Mendeleev's
insight
was
so
valuable
that
when
radioactive
elements
began
being
synthesized
in
laboratories
during
this
century
he
got
one
named
after
him:
Mendeleviumânote
the
dropping
of
the
final
e!âthe
101st
element
(symbol
Md)
first
synthesized
in
1955
Other
scientists
with
eponymous
atoms
include
the
discoverers
of
radium
Pierre
and
Marie
Curie
(element
96
Curium
symbol
Cm
discovered
in
1944)
Ernest
O
Lawrence
founder
of
the
Lawrence
Berkeley
and
Lawrence
Livermore
laboratories
(element
103
Lawrencium
symbol
Lr
synthesized
in
1961)
and
of
course
Albert
Einstein
(element
99
Einsteinium
symbol
Es
created
in
1952)âthe
only
instance
of
an
atom
named
after
someone
still
living
at
the
time
of
its
discovery
(He
died
in
1955.)
Place
names
and
celestial
bodies
have
been
fruitful
source
of
names
for
both
natural
and
synthetic
elements
For
the
outer
planets
there
are
uranium
neptunium
and
plutonium
Cerium
is
named
for
the
asteroid
Ceres
both
having
been
discovered
the
same
year
(1801)
National
commemoratives
include
Americium
Germanium
Polonium
and
Francium;
ancient
France
likewise
gets
nod
in
Gallium
(Ga)
the
only
metal
that
melts
in
your
hand
not
in
your
chamber
(unless
you
have
very
warm
room)ânamed
both
for
Gaul
(Latin
Gallia
that
place
which
thanks
to
Julius
Caesar's
memoir
of
its
subjugation
by
the
Romans
every
schoolchild
used
to
know
was
divided
into
three
parts)
and
in
gesture
of
unusual
levity
as
pun
on
the
name
of
its
discoverer
Paul-Ãmile
Lecoq
de
Boisbaudran
(French
coq
and
Latin
gallus
both
mean
the
same
thing:
rooster.)
One
place
has
the
distinction
of
having
no
fewer
than
four
atoms
named
after
it
an
embarrassment
of
nomenclature
arising
from
what
was
originally
thought
to
be
one
element
turning
out
on
closer
inspection
to
be
several
Carl
Gustav
Mosander
found
new
element
in
geological
sample
from
Ytterby
Sweden
town
just
few
miles
north
of
GÃ¶teborg
(the
Swedish
terminus
for
the
ferry
from
Frederikshavn
Denmark
Do
not
confuse
this
with
Ytterby
Sweden
which
is
1000
kilometers
to
the
north
on
the
gulf
of
Bothnia)
Naturally
enough
Mosander
named
the
new
element
Ytterbium
after
the
town
One
can
well
imagine
his
surprise
when
the
new
atom
turned
out
to
be
plural
To
make
the
best
of
bad
situation
the
second
and
third
elements
got
names
from
pieces
of
the
first:
Erbium
(Er)
and
Terbium
(Tb)
Complicating
matters
even
more
in
1907
another
chemist
George
Urbain
discovered
that
the
remaining
element
was
actually
two
The
new
one
got
called
Ytterbium
(Yb)
and
Mosander's
original
find
got
the
name
Yttrium
(Y)
Synthetic
yttrium
aluminum
garnets
(YAGs)
are
favored
by
jewelers
and
their
public
because
the
high
refractive
index
of
the
gem
approaches
that
of
diamond
at
fraction
of
the
cost
Revelation
is
not
seal'd:
New
elements
are
being
discovered
to
this
day
As
of
last
year
the
Society
for
Heavy
Ion
Research
in
Darmstadt
Germany
had
gotten
up
to
element
112
These
new
radioactive
atoms
are
remarkably
ephemeral
often
decaying
in
millionths
of
second
into
lighter
elements
by
casting
off
subatomic
particles
their
fleeting
lives
documented
only
by
vapor
trails
Still
they
enjoy
brief
existence
of
sort
and
names
for
them
honoring
physicists
and
the
locations
of
their
laboratories
are
already
queued
up
awaiting
approval
by
the
scientific
community
at
large:
Rutherfordium
for
#104
(Ernest
Rutherford)
Dubnium
for
#105
(after
the
Russian
lab
at
Dubna)
Seaborgium
for
#106
(Glenn
Seaborg)
Bohrium
for
#107
(Niels
Bohr)
Hassium
for
#108
(Hesse
province
in
Germany
where
the
Darmstadt
lab
is
located)
andâthe
first
element
to
be
named
solely
for
womanâMeitnerium
for
#109
(Lise
Meitner)
It
is
sobering
thought
then
to
consider
that
virtually
all
of
the
elements
above
#2
(helium
the
fusion
product
of
the
hydrogen
that
makes
up
the
stars
our
sun
included)
are
the
result
of
the
catastrophic
blowing
apart
of
prior
suns
and
that
our
earth
and
everything
else
in
our
own
solar
system
are
mere
cosmic
hand-me-downs
from
someone
else's
supernova
In
this
light
the
history
of
the
universe
according
to
Taoist
thought
can
be
either
depressing
or
exhilarating
depending
on
one's
point
of
view;
at
any
rate
it
seems
true
enough
as
far
as
the
Big
Picture
goes:
First
there
was
nothing
Then
there
was
something
Then
there
was
hydrogen
Then
there
was
dirty
hydrogen

DAREâMore
Than
Halfway
There
Because
logophiles
regularly
ask
about
the
progress
of
the
Dictionary
of
American
Regional
English
(familiarly
known
as
DARE)
I'd
like
to
take
the
opportunity
of
VERBATIM's
rebirth
to
bring
you
all
up
to
date
First
let
me
answer
the
most
frequently
asked
question
How
is
Fred
Cassidy
doing?
I'm
delighted
to
say
that
Frederic
G
Cassidy
DARE's
Chief
Editor
as
well
as
the
founder
of
and
inspiration
behind
the
project
shows
few
signs
of
slowing
down
as
he
approaches
his
ninety-first
birthday
His
recent
return
from
trip
to
Jamaica
(where
he
was
born
and
later
did
the
research
for
his
books
on
Jamaican
English)
and
his
imminent
departure
for
conference
on
Caribbean
Linguistics
in
St
Lucia
should
convince
you
of
his
good
health!
The
second
most
frequently
asked
question
When
will
Volume
IV
be
available?
is
more
difficult
to
answer
Before
try
let
me
give
quick
synopsis
of
the
project
for
those
who
aren't
already
familiar
with
it
The
Dictionary
of
American
Regional
English
is
reference
tool
unlike
any
other
Its
aim
is
not
to
prescribe
how
Americans
should
speak
or
even
to
describe
the
language
we
use
as
cultivated
speakers
and
writers
Instead
it
tries
to
document
the
varieties
of
English
that
are
not
found
throughout
the
countryâthose
words
pronunciations
and
phrases
that
vary
from
one
region
to
another
that
are
learned
at
home
rather
than
at
school
or
that
are
part
of
our
oral
rather
than
our
written
culture
Although
American
English
is
remarkably
homogeneous
given
the
tremendous
size
of
the
country
there
are
still
many
thousands
of
differences
that
characterize
the
various
dialect
regions
of
the
United
States
It
is
these
differences
that
DARE
records
The
Dictionary
is
based
both
on
face-to-face
interviews
carried
out
in
all
fifty
states
between
1965
and
1970
and
on
an
extensive
collection
of
written
materials
(diaries
letters
novels
histories
biographies
newspapers
and
government
documents)
that
cover
our
history
from
the
colonial
period
up
to
the
present
These
materials
are
cited
in
individual
entries
to
illustrate
how
words
have
been
used
from
the
seventeenth
century
through
the
end
of
the
twentieth
The
entries
also
include
pronunciations
(if
they
vary
regionally
or
differ
from
what
would
be
expected)
variant
forms
etymologies
(if
DARE
can
add
to
what
is
already
known
about
word's
history)
and
statements
about
regional
and
social
distributions
of
words
and
forms
feature
unique
to
DARE
is
its
inclusion
in
the
text
of
the
dictionary
of
numerous
maps
that
show
where
words
were
found
in
the
1,002
communities
investigated
during
the
fieldwork
The
maps
are
distorted
to
reflect
population
density
rather
than
geographic
area
(giving
speaker
in
small
but
densely
populated
Connecticut
as
much
space
as
speaker
in
large
but
sparsely
populated
Nevada)
Though
the
maps
are
disconcerting
at
first
glance
one
easily
learns
to
translate
the
state
boundaries
and
make
sense
of
the
regional
patterns
Volume
I
including
extensive
introductory
matter
and
the
letters
A-C
was
published
in
1985
(to
the
acclaim
of
scholarly
and
lay
reviewers
alike
I'm
pleased
to
say)
It
had
gone
into
fifth
printing
within
year
of
publication
Volume
II
(D-H)
came
out
in
1991
and
Volume
III
(I-O)
appeared
in
1996
Volume
IV
will
include
through
the
middle
of
(we
hate
to
divide
letter
in
the
middle
but
you
all
know
how
big
is)
And
Volume
will
take
us
through
Z
To
give
you
sample
of
what's
to
come
let
me
mention
few
representative
headwords
from
Volume
IVâchosen
simply
because
like
them
(If
they
are
strange
to
you
see
below
for
their
meanings.)
The
P's
take
us
from
pandowdy
to
pompey
to
pudjicky;
the
Q's
offer
qualmish
quick
start
and
quiddle;
in
we
find
ramstugious
redd
up
robin
snow
and
rumpelkammer;
and
yields
saluggi
say-so
and
smearcase
Not
to
be
outdone
in
creativity
the
natural
science
entries
offer
pollynose
prickly
pig
puppy
toes
Quaker
bonnet
railroad
Annie
and
sac-a-lait
among
many
many
others
As
you
can
see
from
this
sample
we
are
moving
steadily
along
through
the
alphabet
Our
original
hope
had
been
to
publish
Volume
IV
in
2001
with
Volume
coming
out
in
2006
That
schedule
however
was
contingent
on
our
maintaining
our
earlier
level
of
funding
which
has
become
increasingly
difficult
and
in
the
last
few
years
impossible
In
fact
our
financial
woes
necessitated
staff
reduction
last
summer
and
it
looks
as
if
Volume
IV
will
not
be
ready
before
2002
Although
the
project
is
located
on
the
campus
of
the
University
of
Wisconsin-Madison
the
University
can
provide
very
limited
financial
support
Our
funding
has
come
primarily
from
grants
from
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Humanities
matched
by
gifts
from
numerous
foundations
and
individuals
While
the
Andrew
W
Mellon
Foundation
was
for
many
years
our
largest
source
of
private
funds
we
have
also
received
assistance
from
the
Brittingham
Fund
the
Gladys
Krieble
Delmas
Foundation
the
Evjue
Foundation
the
Horace
W
Goldsmith
Foundation
the
Hillsdale
Fund
Inc.
and
the
Grace
Jones
Richardson
Trust
among
others
After
helping
DARE
for
nearly
twenty
years
(despite
its
usual
limit
of
ten
years)
the
Mellon
Foundation
has
had
to
move
on
to
other
worthy
projects
So
we
must
find
other
friends
who
can
help
us
see
that
this
project
reaches
the
only
reasonable
conclusion
for
dictionaryâthe
letter
Z
The
single
bright
spot
in
our
funding
picture
is
that
the
Dean
of
the
College
of
Letters
and
Science
here
at
the
UWMadison
has
provided
DARE
with
Development
Specialist
for
three
years
David
Simon
has
just
joined
our
staff
and
will
be
devoting
his
considerable
energies
to
finding
new
sources
of
funding
for
DARE
Although
we
hope
that
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Humanities
will
continue
to
provide
us
with
some
support
it
is
clear
that
the
future
of
the
project
depends
largely
on
private
philanthropy
We
all
know
people
who
know
people
who
might
be
able
to
help
If
you
can
be
part

our

Exploring

with

America
In
August
1967
at
the
Dictionary
of
American
Regional
English
(DARE)
offices
on
the
University
of
Wisconsin
campus
Frederic
G
Cassidy
assembled
the
third
group
of
dialect
fieldworkers
he
would
send
out
in
Word
Wagons
(Dodge
vans
converted
to
campers)
to
collect
regional
words
from
far-flung
reaches
of
the
United
States
was
one;
the
others
were
Tom
Clark
Stanley
J
Cook
and
Patt
Van
Dyke
We
went
through
week
of
orientation
and
instruction
getting
to
know
the
office
staff
and
operations
having
our
driving
and
phonetic
transcription
skills
checked
and
learning
to
use
our
camping
and
recording
equipment
Bibliographer
Goldye
Mohr
had
identified
the
communities
we
were
to
visit
It
was
up
to
us
to
choose
an
efficient
itinerary
and
locate
informantsâas
many
as
needed
but
ideally
just
one
in
each
placeâto
answer
the
253-page
DARE
questionnaire
(QR)
We
were
advised
to
begin
each
project
by
notifying
the
county
sheriff
town
clerk
or
other
officials
and
to
ask
them
for
leads
to
good
informants
The
ideal
informant
(INF)
was
native
and
lifelong
resident
from
an
old
local
family
someone
without
much
exposure
to
the
outside
world
who
spoke
regularly
and
familiarly
with
community
members
of
all
social
ranks
and
occupations
who
could
remember
precisely
how
all
of
them
talked
about
their
social
domestic
economic
and
natural
environments
and
who
would
donate
ten
to
twenty
hours
of
free
time
to
transmit
all
this
information
The
ideal
fieldworker
(FW)
was
good
listener
with
at
least
little
linguistic
training
and
lot
of
SprachgefÃ¼hl
who
knew
as
much
about
the
world
in
general
as
the
INF
knew
about
the
local
part
of
it
First
though
the
FW
had
to
possess
talent
for
fitting
in
so
as
to
make
such
an
impression
of
integrity
and
worth
on
local
officials
that
they
arranged
an
introduction
at
once
to
the
ideal
INF
Once
the
interview
began
this
ideal
FW
would
seem
as
familiar
as
an
old
friend
so
that
the
INF
always
spoke
in
everyday
terms
instead
of
bookish
formal
ones
Like
all
ideals
these
remained
abstract
and
DARE
had
to
make
do
with
actual
human
beings
and
their
limitations
Judging
by
the
quality
of
the
1,002
QRs
archived
in
Madison
weâINFs
and
FWs
alikeâmust
have
compensated
for
our
limitations
pretty
well
Of
my
own
limitations
the
one
had
to
compensate
for
most
was
my
ignorance
of
city
life
asked
Jim
Hartman
the
fieldwork
coordinator
not
to
send
me
on
any
more
urban
expeditions
than
necessary
However
since
was
the
sole
FW
assigned
to
Louisiana
New
Orleans
was
necessary
In
fact
it
was
necessary
twice
because
two
QRs
were
allocated
in
the
metropolitan
area
To
increase
coverage
divided
one
between
white
suburban
housewife
and
black
gardener
from
downtown
For
the
other
went
to
the
Irish
Channel
working-class
neighborhood
This
was
the
environment
was
most
ill-suited
for
knew
how
to
act
in
some
places
Growing
up
in
the
rural
Ozarks
learned
early
that
good
country
people
expect
visitors
to
sit
and
visit
spell
before
bringing
up
their
business
From
dealing
with
academic
administrators
knew
to
come
straight
to
the
point
with
personages
who
sit
behind
large
desks
and
have
their
time
allocated
by
secretaries
One
of
my
teachers
South
Carolina
native
had
taught
me
that
white
men
like
me
always
had
to
state
their
business
clearly
when
looking
for
resident
of
black
neighborhood;
otherwise
the
neighbors
would
assume
they
were
up
to
no
good
and
pretend
not
to
know
the
person
Because
my
city
experience
was
largely
limited
to
student
enclaves
however
nothing
prepared
me
for
establishing
turf
in
working-class
urban
neighborhood
My
difficulty
was
exacerbated
by
the
setting
where
was
introduced
by
city
councilman:
bar
Parasol's
which
played
central
role
in
the
social
and
cultural
life
of
the
Irish
Channel
could
find
no
one
INF
who
would
withdraw
to
private
spot
for
quiet
interview;
just
had
to
show
up
every
afternoon
and
interview
whichever
authentic
old-time
Irish
Channel
male
residents
came
in
and
agreed
to
talk
there
in
the
bar
Women
stayed
on
the
restaurant
side
and
was
given
to
understand
it
would
be
presumptuous
of
me
to
try
to
interview
them
On
the
bar
side
was
expected
to
buy
rounds
of
drinks
when
my
turn
came
up
and
to
drink
the
beer
served
to
me
when
others
bought
rounds
The
regulars
came
almost
every
day
to
play
out
roles
(jokester
misanthrope
goosey
guy
smiley
guy
gourmand
and
others)
in
an
ongoing
plotless
improvisational
drama
It
was
fun-loving
group
and
would
have
had
as
much
fun
as
anybody
if
had
not
had
work
to
do
but
keeping
the
QR
going
required
continual
exercise
of
the
will
Normally
with
one
INF
once
we
established
working
relationship
my
only
strain
came
from
making
the
questions
understood
and
making
sure
understood
the
answers
In
Parasol's
though
had
to
struggle
every
night
to
shape
and
defend
my
identity
because
it
never
did
settle
down
to
single
role
that
every
actor
could
play
to
To
some
was
the
guy
writing
book
One
fellow
always
greeted
me
with
Arkansas!
Arkansas!
Another
fixated
on
Wisconsin
and
repeatedly
tried
to
start
friendly
arguments
about
the
Green
Bay
Packers
quintessential
incident:
one
night
patron
new
to
me
came
in
noticed
me
asking
questions
and
began
asking
some
himself
explained
cordially
what
was
doing
and
who
worked
for
He
said
Oh
Yankee
hunh?
Still
cordially
said
No
I'm
not
Yankee
just
work
for
the
University
of
Wisconsin
was
born
and
raised
in
Arkansas
He
sparred
with
me
about
what
the
Dictionary
would
be
good
for
and
called
me
Yankee
again
This
time
half
for
show
and
half
in
real
anger
stood
up
slammed
my
fist
to
the
table
and
shouted
God
damn
it
I'm
not
Yankee!
There
were
several
of
us
at
the
table
and
every-body's
beer
turned
over
thought
Uh-oh
now
I've
got
fight
on
my
hands
Sensing
had
to
show
some
spunk
but
unable
to
guage
it
right
had
almost
shown
too
much
He
said
Take
it
easy
I'm
not
trying
to
start
nothing
He
didn't
back
off
for
long;
after
had
bought
more
beer
he
came
after
me
again
about
the
Dictionary
think
he
said
it's
lot
of
bullshit
answered
much
the
way
had
answered
more
delicately
phrased
objections
in
Arkansas
and
north
Louisiana:
told
how
for
example
fisherman
would
be
able
to
check
the
Dictionary
if
he
caught
mudfish
in
Florida
and
wanted
to
find
out
what
the
real
name
of
it
was
He
could
find
that
the
mudfish
is
called
bowfin
in
textbooks
that
in
south
Arkansas
and
north
Louisiana
it
is
written
grindle
or
grinnel
but
always
pronounced
[`
grinl
];
that
in
south
Louisiana
it
is
called
green
cypress
trout
grinnel
and
choupique
which
in
English
is
pronounced
[Å¡];
that
in
northwest
Florida
the
word
grindle
is
sometimes
pronounced
[`grindl]
person
could
find
similar
interesting
bits
of
information
about
every
aspect
of
daily
life
Such
explanations
had
always
worked
before
but
here
had
gauged
wrong
again
The
people
farther
north
had
all
been
earnest
Protestants
with
utilitarian
outlook
This
man
resided
in
Catholic
neighborhood
whose
cultural
values
were
epitomized
by
parades:
Mardi
Gras
St
Patrick's
Day
and
St
Joseph's
Day
Celebrants
began
planning
next
year's
parade
the
day
after
this
year's
was
over
should
have
known
that
these
interests
did
not
point
to
utilitarian
turn
of
mind
Yeah
he
said
but
still
think
it's
lot
of
bullshit
few
years
later
would
present
symposium
paper
titled
Scholarship
as
Play
saying
academic
pursuits
manifest
the
human
tendency
to
extend
the
learning
activity
of
play
all
the
way
through
adulthood
instead
of
abandoning
it
after
adolescence
as
most
other
mammals
do
Even
in
1968
though
had
long
realizedâwithout
thinking
the
matter
through
so
thoroughly
as
did
for
the
paperâthat
academic
study
is
not
serious
in
the
same
sense
that
farming
mining
weaving
and
child-rearing
are
had
seldom
said
so
openly
but
this
began
to
seem
like
good
time
grinned
and
looked
the
man
in
the
eye
and
said
To
tell
you
the
truth
think
it's
lot
of
bullshit
myself
But
really
enjoy
doing
it
He
looked
blank
for
moment
and
then
grinned
back
and
said
You
know
something?
kinda
like
you!
Fitting
in
can
have
its
drawbacks
Another
time
was
able
to
keep
an
informant
only
because
was
an
outsider;
she
realized
she
should
make
allowances
for
my
ignorance
That
story
is
worth
telling
if
only
for
the
word
she
made
allowances
for
In
introducing
myself
and
DARE
to
prospective
INF
in
Cameron
LA
gave
examples
of
what
had
learned
Among
others
mentioned
the
names
caouane
[\?\ka\?\wÎµn]
or
[\?\ka\?\wÃ¦n]
turtle;
gros-bec
[\?\gro(u),bÎµk]
night
heron;
and
bec-scie
[\?\bÎµk\?\si]
merganser
She
agreed
to
work
with
me
but
the
next
day
she
warned
me
not
to
say
one
of
the
words
had
used
the
day
before
because
it
was
dirty
word
and
would
get
in
trouble
for
it
At
the
time
could
not
recall
any
words
had
said
asked
Which
one?
She
cast
down
her
eyes
and
said
can't
tell
you
For
day
or
two
was
almost
afraid
to
speak
at
all
until
narrowed
down
to
the
words
mentioned
above
Just
before
leaving
Cameron
made
an
educated
guess
and
asked
my
INF
if
it
was
the
word
for
turtle
that
was
so
bad
She
said
it
was
Hartman
had
told
me
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
the
southeastern
turtle
name
cooter
with
the
slang
meaning
pudendum
If
that
was
what
caouane
meant
we
had
something
pursued
the
investigation
in
bar
where
verbal
taboos
are
often
relaxed
There
was
one
male
customer
inside
talking
with
the
proprietress
After
had
circumlocuted
while
to
avoid
offense
to
her
she
and
the
customer
agreed
slyly
they
knew
what
word
meant
learned
over
to
the
man
cupped
my
ear
and
intoned
dramatically
Tell
me
It's
caouane
[\?\ka\?\wÃ¦n]
he
said
and
in
French
it
means
pussy
remained
outwardly
calm
but
could
have
jumped
up
and
down
and
shouted
wrote
to
Cassidy
expressing
puzzlement
remembered
Thomas
Pyles
pointing
out
in
class
once
that
animal
metaphors
for
this
body
part
name
cute
furry
animals:
pussy
beaver
squirrel
monkey
cony
and
(in
France)
lapin
Nothing
about
turtle
is
cuddlesome;
it
does
not
fit
the
pattern
Cassidy
offered
an
intriguing
explanation:
the
metaphor
probably
originated
in
Caribbean
folklore
which
has
it
that
sea
turtles
(the
referent
for
caouane
in
standard
French
dictionaries)
copulate
for
hundred
days
at
time
In
Louisiana
the
name
was
transferred
to
freshwater
turtle
with
far
more
modest
size
and
amatory
tenacity
but
the
metaphor
persisted
It
pays
tribute
not
to
cuteness
but
to
sexual

never
have

all
this
if
my

had
not
proffered
the
courtesy
owed
to
an
ignorant
outsider
[Textual

The
anecdotes
recounted
here
are
retellings
of
my
fieldwork
journal
entries
dated
Feb
and
Mar
7
[1968]
The

Ups
and
Downs
Explaining
English
idioms
is
tough
enough
but
how
do
you
account
for
the
seemingly
contradictory
ones?
was
in
taxi
with
Japanese
friend
of
mine
and
the
driver
was
cutting
through
traffic
like
speedboat
through
docking
area
Hey
buddy!
rapped
on
the
divider-glass
Slow
up
little
will
you?
This
tactic
actually
worked
But
when
we
arrived
at
our
destination
and
were
safely
on
the
sidewalk
my
friend
murmured
Excuse
me
but
isn't
the
proper
expression
slow
down?
Well
yes
began
mean
no
It's
both
really
My
friend
cocked
his
head
as
if
to
say
You
Occidentals!
could
have
said
something
about
Japaneseâhow
hai
sometimes
means
yes
and
sometimes
means
no
âbut
decided
not
to
pursue
it
further
Still
it
got
me
thinking
Take
restaurant
doing
brisk
business:
when
closing
time
comes
around
does
it
shut
up
for
the
night
or
shut
down
When
your
grandmother
picked
all
those
cherries
did
she
put
up
preserves
or
put
down
canned
cherries
for
the
winter?
For
proper
directions
do
you
go
down
the
road
for
mile
before
turning
right
or
up
the
road?
These
may
seem
like
imponderables
but
we
can
tease
out
few
differences
First
of
all
when
an
establishment
shuts
up
it
simply
closes
but
when
it
shuts
down
it
ceases
activity
If
this
sounds
like
too
nice
distinction
consider
common
usage:
factories
shut
down
rather
than
shutting
up;
conversely
your
rude
brother
may
ask
you
to
shut
up
not
shut
down
Similarly
putting
up
food
often
involves
sealing
it
in
jars
later
stored
on
shelves
as
opposed
to
putting
down
good
supply
of
hay
for
your
livestock
As
for
which
way
to
go
on
road
up
is
either
literally
up
rise
due
north
or
just
the
way
the
speaker
is
pointing
English
has
other
such
ups
and
downs:
ripping
up
house
versus
ripping
down
the
same
structure
for
instance
or
the
hearty
Drink
it
down!
instead
of
Drink
it
up!
If
usage
is
sundial
the
shade
of
meaning
alters
its
angle
slightly
here
Ripping
up
anything
means
destroying
it
often
by
severing
the
connective
tissues
from
ripping
up
floorboards
to
ripping
up
draft
card
To
rip
down
building
on
the
other
hand
is
to
raze
it
Break
up
and
break
down
like
tear
up
and
tear
down
and
cut
up
and
cut
down
work
comparably
Idiomatic
drinking
like
drinking
itself
is
little
fuzzier
but
two
senses
coexist:
having
your
comrades
clap
you
on
the
back
as
you
tilt
up
your
beer
stein
or
else
downing
draught
of
nasty
medicine
because
the
doctor
tells
you
to
Of
course
most
ups
and
downs
function
as
simple
opposites
as
in
uptown
versus
downtown
To
look
up
road
should
be
in
the
opposite
direction
of
to
look
down
it
just
as
to
look
up
to
person
you
admire
is
the
course
of
to
look
down
on
an
inferior
But
what
about
expressions
that
split
unevenly?
To
sit
up
is
at
most
slant-opposite
of
to
sit
down
since
sitting
down
means
to
sit
whereas
sitting
up
means
that
you
were
already
sitting
but
are
now
improving
your
posture
(A
sit-up
with
hyphen
exercises
your
abdominal
muscles
but
sit-down
strike
tends
to
exercise
the
tempers
of
management.)
And
if
you
happen
to
be
sitting
already
then
you
can
stand
up
but
if
you're
asked
to
stand
down
then
you're
still
standing
after
that
just
not
on
the
stage
or
dais
Of
course
if
you're
in
the
military
to
stand
down
is
to
be
at
ease
no
longer
at
attention
Other
uneven
splits
include
hurry
up
or
to
hasten
versus
hurry
down
to
hie
yourself
in
particular
direction
You
dig
up
buried
treasure
but
dig
down
on
your
energy
reserves
to
finish
that
race
You
can
be
called
up
for
army
duty
but
in
Britain
to
be
called
down
from
university
is
bit
of
disgrace
similar
to
expulsion
in
the
United
States
Why
are
these
ups
and
downs
not
polar
opposites?
If
it
comes
to
that
even
uptown
and
downtown
aren't
quite
equivalent
because
downtown
in
many
towns
is
only
few
blocks
After
while
you
can
see
difference
emerging
Get
up
and
get
down
for
instance
could
be
exact
antonyms
except
that
each
has
one
or
more
secondary
meaning
that
leads
away
from
the
original
paired
meanings
Get
up
may
mean
to
pull
yourself
up
from
the
ground
or
to
arise
from
bed
In
the
nominal
sense
getup
can
mean
costume
Get
down
however
besides
meaning
to
alight
also
refers
to
loosening
up
or
having
sex
(from
get
down
to
it
)
as
in
the
refrains
of
so
many
funk
songs
from
the
1970's
To
throw
up
parcel
onto
the
boat
may
be
the
opposite
of
to
throw
down
that
parcel
onto
the
loading
dock
but
clearly
throw
up
has
regurgitative
meaning
that
throw
down
lacks
This
second
meaning
forms
slant-opposite
Put
up
and
put
down
for
instance
need
not
refer
just
to
food:
you
can
put
up
guest
(and
put
up
with
him
as
well)
or
put
down
dying
dog
(a
milder
form
of
which
applies
to
making
babies
sleep)
To
return
to
look
up
and
look
down
which
seemed
so
complementary
in
terms
of
location
or
regard:
look
up
has
tertiary
meaning
as
in
looking
up
word
in
the
dictionary
that
look
down
lacks
Thus
pipe
up
and
pipe
down
are
also
slantopposites:
to
speak
out
or
to
tune
band
versus
to
lower
your
voice
Keep
up
means
to
stay
with
the
pace
whereas
keep
down
is
to
oppress
or
not
to
disgorge
When
you
turn
down
are
you
refusing
an
offer
or
folding
bedsheet?
You
can
just
as
well
turn
up
that
bedsheet
but
when
good
luck
turns
up
that
introduces
new
wrinkle
Maybe
one
good
turn
deserves
its
opposite
As
D
H
Lawrence
once
wrote
in
an
autobiographical
poem
called
Red-Herring:
My
father
was
working
man
and
collier
was
he
at
six
in
the
morning
they
turned
him
down
and
they
turned
him
up
for
tea
The
various
senses
of
both
turns
show
lot
about
the
mining
business
and
what
an
efficient
hell
it
was
In
similar
vein:
you
run
up
flag
on
the
pole
or
run
up
gross
of
new
product
or
just
run
up
whopping
bill
but
you
run
down
colleague
or
truck
may
run
down
man
on
the
street
And
the
rundown
is
inside
information
You
can
touch
up
paint
job
but
you
touch
down
on
an
airfield
And
this
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
touchdown
that
all
American
football
fans
know
You
can
stay
up
as
in
keeping
awake
or
stay
down
as
in
hugging
the
boxing
ring
mat
for
fear
of
your
opponent
yet
to
stay
up
can
be
the
opposite
of
to
stay
downâit
just
depends
on
the
context
(As
linguist
friend
of
mine
once
wearily
conceded
Everything
depends
on
the
context.)
You
can
even
apply
some
ingenious
logic
to
the
ups
and
downs:
if
you
want
to
pack
up
more
in
an
already
stuffed
suitcase
better
first
pack
down
what
you
have
in
there
If
you
live
it
up
too
freely
you
may
never
live
it
down
And
crackdowns
done
while
there
is
still
time
may
prevent
future
crackups
Or
comeuppance
may
lead
to
bringdown
Then
there
are
the
single
halves
You
can
cook
up
storm
but
if
you
attempt
to
cook
down
one
leave
me
out
of
your
dinner
invitations
You
can
catch
up
to
your
rival
but
who
ever
heard
of
catch
down
You
can
pick
up
quart
of
milk
at
the
supermarket
or
some
information
by
keeping
your
ears
open
but
you
generally
don't
pick
down
anything
When
you
get
too
rowdy
you
may
be
asked
to
quiet
down
never
quite
up
âor
in
reverse
clam
up
but
never
clam
down
Oppositely
you
may
be
asked
to
'fess
up
or
own
up
but
not
in
any
other
direction
Facing
rough
day
ahead
you
may
want
to
rest
up
but
never
rest
down
You
can't
butter
down
your
boss
Your
feelings
may
be
pent
up
inside
not
pent
down
Scuffing
your
shoes
on
the
pavement
wears
down
the
leather
not
up
And
how
would
you
ever
hunker
up?
On
the
other
hand
the
lopsided
quality
of
single
halves
has
caused
few
reparations
Nowadays
the
warm
up
for
an
athletic
meet
is
paired
after
the
event
with
warm
down
And
the
old
query
What's
up?
has
streetwise
counterpart
What's
going
down?
Just
as
nature
is
reputed
to
abhor
vacuum
some
people
can't
abide
asymmetry
Of
course
there
are
other
ins
and
outs
to
pursue
here
but
in
and
out
just
introduce
more
instances
of
slant
usage
from
read
in
and
read
out
toââ(
fill
in
or
fill
out
the
blank)
Should
go
off
from
here?
Or
should
go
on?
Word
Words
We
need
some
new
words
to
describe
words
English
already
has
several
well
known
-onym
words
(from
the
Greek
onyma
meaning
name)
such
as
synonym
(same
meaning)
antonym
(opposite
meaning)
and
homonym
(same
sound)
Less
well
known
is
heteronym
(same
spelling
but
different
sound
e.g.
sow
meaning
pig
and
sow
meaning
planting
seeds)
Heteronyms
are
also
called
homographs
Then
there's
pseudonym
(false
name)
eponym
(named
for
person
e.g.
sandwich
after
Lord
Sandwich)
and
acronym
(formed
from
the
initial
letters
or
syllables
of
group
of
words
e.g.
snafu
meaning
Situation
Normal;
All
Fouled
Up
or
laser
meaning
Light
Amplification
Stimulated
Emissions
Radiation)
It
was
that
word
acronym
that
started
me
thinking
about
the
need
for
more
word
words
The
word
acronym
is
sometimes
used
for
words
formed
from
the
first
two
letters
of
group
of
words
Soho
is
the
area
of
Manhattan
SOuth
of
HOuston
Street
But
is
Soho
an
acronym?
Yes
if
we
accept
definition
that
includes
the
initial
letters
But
can't
we
be
more
precise?
Let's
leave
acronym
for
word
formed
from
the
first
letter
of
several
words
Then
we'll
need
word
for
word
formed
from
the
first
two
letters
of
words
How
about
bicronym
That
captures
the
initial-letter
sense
of
acronym
but
uses
the
combining
form
bi-
signifying
two
(from
the
Latin
bi-
meaning
twice
or
having
two)
What
then
should
we
do
with
Tribeca
the
area
of
Manhattan
that
is
the
TRIangle
BElow
CAnal
Street?
Bicronym
won't
do
because
we
are
using
the
first
three
letters
of
triangle
Tricronym
won't
do
either
because
we
are
using
only
the
first
two
letters
from
below
and
Canal
Perhaps
the
answer
is
polycronym
still
capturing
the
initial-letter
sense
of
acronym
but
using
the
combining
form
poly-
signifying
many
(from
the
Greek
polus
meaning
much)
These
words
bicronym
and
polycronym
suggest
the
need
for
still
another
word
The
words
bicronym
and
polycronym
are
formed
by
breaking
up
the
combining
form
acro-
(from
the
Greek
acros
meaning
highest)
into
a-
and
cro-
and
combining
bi-
or
poly-
with
cro-
word
thus
formed
by
breaking
up
an
existing
combining
form
prefix
root
or
suffix
should
also
have
name
It
could
be
fractonym
using
the
coined
combining
form
fracto-
(from
the
Latin
fractus
the
past
participle
of
frangire
meaning
to
break)
Fractonyms
existed
in
English
before
we
had
word
for
them
fairly
well
known
example
is
prequel
the
word
that
means
an
episode
or
movie
that
portrays
events
occurring
before
the
events
in
the
original
episode
or
movie
Prequel
takes
the
word
sequel
(Latin
sequela
meaning
what
follows)
breaks
it
into
se-
and
-quel
and
then
combines
-quel
with
the
prefix
pre-
Another
current
example
of
fractonym
is
threepeat
used
to
describe
the
feat
of
team
or
individual
who
wins
an
annual
championship
three
years
in
row
The
Chicago
Bulls
were
widely
reported
to
have
achieved
threepeat
in
professional
basketball
Repeat
was
broken
into
re-
and
-peat
and
-peat
was
combined
with
three
VoilÃ 
another
fractonym!
Then
we
could
have
retronym
meaning
word
formed
by
reversing
the
spelling
of
another
word
Lord
Kelvin
is
credited
with
coining
mho
by
reversing
the
spelling
of
ohm
An
ohm
is
unit
of
electrical
resistance
(named
for
the
German
physicist
Georg
Simon
Ohm)
and
mho
is
unit
of
conductivity
of
body
whose
resistance
is
one
ohm
We
could
also
call
mho
backword
but
we
are
better
off
staying
with
the
family
of
-onyms
Retronym
derives
from
the
combining
form
retro-
(from
the
Latin
retro
meaning
backward)
related
word
is
needed
for
word
with
two
opposite
meanings
Sanction
means
to
forbid
and
also
to
permit
Moot
means
debate
and
moot
point
originally
meant
debatable
point
and
then
also
came
to
mean
point
that
was
not
debatable
or
not
worth
debating
Such
perplexing
word
might
be
called
contronym
using
the
prefix
contra-
(from
the
Latin
contra
meaning
against)
or
possibly
contradictonym
We
also
need
word
for
word
that
illustrates
its
own
meaning
Oxymoron
means
phrase
that
contrasts
opposites
for
literary
effect
e.g.
deafening
silence
Oxymoron
derives
from
the
Greek
oxymoros
meaning
pointedly
foolish
which
itself
derives
from
oxy-
combining
form
meaning
sharp
(from
the
Greek
oxus
meaning
sharp)
and
moron
(from
the
Greek
moros
meaning
dull)
Oxymoron
is
an
oxymoron
But
what
should
we
call
such
an
unusual
word?
One
possibility
is
etymonym
(pronounced
ehTYM-o-nym)
using
the
coined
combining
form
etymo-
(from
the
Greek
etymon
meaning
the
true
meaning
of
word
which
derives
from
etymos
meaning
true
or
real)
This
is
not
as
rare
category
as
you
might
think
Another
etymonym
is
noun
(noun
is
noun)
Prefix
almost
qualifies;
at
least
it
illustrates
prefix
Then
there
should
be
word
for
word
that
has
an
etymology
that
is
no
longer
true
Atom
literally
means
hypothetical
body
that
is
so
small
that
it
is
incapable
of
being
further
divided
Atom
derives
from
the
combining
form
a-
(from
the
Greek
meaning
not
and
the
Greek
tomos
meaning
cut)
Of
course
in
the
age
of
neutrons
protons
electrons
and
even
quarks
we
now
know
that
an
atom
is
not
particle
that
cannot
be
divided
into
smaller
particles
So
we
need
word
for
outdated
etymologies
Possibly
pseudoetymonym
using
the
combining
forms
pseudo-
and
etymo-
Another
possibility
is
gerontoetymonym
(pronounced
ger-ON-to-ehTYM-o-nym)
using
the
combining
forms
geronto-
meaning
old
(from
the
Greek
gerontos
meaning
old
man)
and
etymo-
Perhaps
better
to
stay
with
pseudoetymonym
and
save
the
prefix
geronto-
to
form
gerontonym
meaning
an
old
word
especially
one
whose
original
meaning
has
been
altered
but
is
not
necessarily
now
false
The
category
of
eponyms
might
be
subdivided
to
add
literatonym
(pronounced
lit-er-AH-to-nym)
meaning
word
derived
from
the
name
of
person
or
place
in
literature
and
mythonym
meaning
literatonym
derived
from
mythology
Herculean
from
Hercules
and
less
obviously
martial
from
Mars)
well
known
literatonym
is
serendipity
often
used
imprecisely
to
mean
anything
found
by
good
luck
but
precisely
meaning
something
good
that
is
unexpectedly
found
while
looking
for
something
else
Serendipity
was
coined
by
Horace
Walpole
from
the
fairy
tale
The
Three
Princes
of
Serendip
(the
ancient
name
for
Ceylon)
who
often
set
sail
for
one
destination
and
found
something
even
better
by
fortunate
accident
What
should
be
call
these
new
words?
Neologism
is
sometimes
used
but
it
means
not
only
new
word
but
also
the
use
of
new
words
Besides
better
to
stay
with
the
-onym
ending
and
call
such
words
neonyms
using
the
combining
form
neo-
(from
the
Greek
neos
meaning
new)
Finally
we

Mad

Tale

Murder
Insanity
and
the
Making
of
the
Oxford
English
Dictionary
At
the
author's
party
held
to
launch
this
book
in
Oxford
last
spring
the
current
editors
of
the
OED
were
green
with
envy
How
could
Simon
Winchester
journalist
best
known
for
travel
books
have
earned
huge
publishers
advance
for
this
book?
And
why
would
the
film
rights
be
worth
even
moreâa
cash
payment
in
the
six
figures
sterling?
It
is
after
all
description
of
what
they
do
every
day
as
lexicographers
The
heart
of
the
story
concerns
two
elderly
gents
who
copy
words
out
of
old
books
and
write
about
them
in
dictionary
It
does
not
seem
the
sort
of
action-adventure
story
that
would
lend
itself
to
film
treatment
Much
as
those
of
us
who
love
words
would
wish
for
it
film
biography
of
Sir
James
Murray
isn't
the
stuff
to
draw
people
to
the
multiplex
theatres
out
by
the
highway
fine
scholar
self-educated
and
proud
man
but
one
whose
favorite
recreation
was
riding
huge
tandem
tricycle
around
Oxford
and
the
surrounding
countryside
Hint:
it's
the
other
guy
The
other
elderly
gentleman
with
library
of
old
books
and
the
recreation
of
copying
curious
words
out
of
them
was
William
Chester
Minor
M.D.
an
American
living
in
England
and
one
of
the
most
faithful
and
useful
of
Dr
Murray's
volunteer
readers
Speaking
to
the
Philological
Society
in
1899
Murray
declared:
So
enormous
have
been
Dr
Minor's
contributions
during
the
past
17
or
18
years
that
we
could
easily
illustrate
the
last
four
centuries
from
his
quotations
alone
Minor
did
little
else
than
make
word
indexes
to
old
books;
it
was
an
obsession
with
him
If
the
filmic
possibilities
aren't
yet
clear
we
should
begin
with
Minor's
birth
in
Ceylon
in
June
1834
the
child
of
New
England
missionaries
Winchester
invents
some
luscious
women:
young
chocolate-skinned
giggling
naked
girls
with
sleek
wet
bodies
and
rosebud
nipples
and
long
hair
and
coltish
legs
with
scarlet
and
purple
petals
folded
behind
their
ears
who
play
in
the
white
Indian
Ocean
surf
and
who
run
quite
without
shame
along
the
cool
wet
sands
on
their
way
back
home
(40)
Here
perhaps
the
cinematic
possibilities
become
little
more
obvious
These
girls
are
not
perhaps
altogether
fictional;
Minor
would
later
tell
people
that
he
began
to
entertain
lascivious
thoughts
about
the
time
he
was
thirteen
And
his
parents
thought
it
was
good
time
to
send
him
back
to
New
Haven
to
board
with
an
uncle
while
he
got
more
education
than
the
mission
schools
could
provide
(In
characteristic
flight
of
the
travel-writer's
imagination
Winchester
hints
that
the
parents
were
sending
him
back
to
Connecticut
where
frolicsome
female
nudity
was
they
thought
less
common.)
Minor
earned
his
medical
degree
from
Yale
in
1863
and
immediately
enlisted
in
the
U.S
Army
The
life
of
an
army
surgeon
in
that
dismal
year
was
horrifying
and
Minor
could
not
have
felt
optimistic
since
neither
Vicksburg
nor
Gettysburg
had
yet
produced
hope
that
the
union
would
be
preserved
In
May
1864
he
was
treating
the
wounded
from
the
Battle
of
the
Wilderness
part
of
the
brutal
and
grueling
campaign
that
would
take
so
many
lives
in
the
peninsula
of
Virginia
But
it
was
not
that
carnage
that
so
influenced
Minor's
life
in
Winchester's
view
but
the
order
that
the
doctor
brand
an
Irish
deserter
on
the
face
with
D
Fear
of
retribution
from
the
unforgiving
Irish
combined
with
those
Sri
Lankan
girls
is
adduced
by
Winchester
as
factor
leading
to
Minor's
life
as
dictionary
maker
The
army
eventually
recognized
that
there
was
something
badly
wrong
with
Minor
and
when
he
continued
to
serve
as
medical
examiner
after
the
war
it
became
apparent
that
he
was
unfit
for
his
responsibilities
as
captain
in
the
medical
corps
He
was
in
1868
diagnosed
as
delusional
and
taken
for
treatment
to
hospital
in
Washington
Released
at
the
behest
of
friends
he
left
for
England
in
October
1871
with
box
of
paints
some
books
and
his
gun
On
February
17
1872
Dr
Minor
shot
George
Merritt
brewery
worker
in
the
back
of
the
neck
as
Merritt
tried
to
flee
He
killed
him
thinking
him
to
be
an
Irishman
stalking
him
and
bent
on
revenge
And
then
when
constable
approached
he
admitted
the
shooting
Minor
was
tried
found
insane
and
committed
to
the
asylum
at
Cawthorneâhence
the
title
of
Winchester's
book
in
Britain:
The
Surgeon
of
Cawthorne:
Tale
of
Murder
Madness
and
the
Love
of
Words
Minor
eventually
learned
of
Dr
Murray's
great
project
and
began
to
copy
words
from
old
books
And
then
in
December
1902
he
cut
off
his
penis
Winchester
would
like
us
to
believe
that
this
surprising
piece
of
surgery
is
connected
to
those
lissome
beauties
of
Sir
Lanka
or
to
intimacies
with
Eliza
Merritt
George's
widow
(Though
Eliza
had
visited
Minor
few
times
and
was
grateful
for
his
contributions
for
the
upkeep
of
her
children
the
idea
that
they
had
been
intimate
some
fifteen
years
earlier
is
utterly
speculative
This
is
one
of
many
flights
of
fancy
during
which
Winchester
negotiates
among
the
possible
the
probable
and
the
no
evidence
exists.)
Consider
the
movie:
what
script
writer
would
show
us
Minor
copying
out
words
from
1693
volume
called
the
Compleat
Woman
rather
than
remorseful
and
forgiving
grapple
with
tipsy
Mrs
Merritt?
In
April
1910
the
British
government
yielded
to
the
importunings
of
Minor's
relatives
and
let
him
go
home
Cawthorne
had
cared
for
him
since
1872
and
now
it
was
time
to
shift
the
costs
of
his
upkeep
to
the
Americans
So
in
the
company
of
his
brother
he
went
to
St
Elizabeth's
in
WashingtonâWinchester
reminds
us
that
an
anti-Semite
American
poet
and
failed
assassin
of
an
American
president
have
been
housed
there
too
Minor
wasn't
quite
through
though;
in
1915
he
smacked
one
of
his
fellow
inmates
though
he
had
but
little
strength
to
hurt
anyone
In
1919
his
nephew
urged
that
he
be
moved
to
an
asylum
in
Connecticut
On
March
26
1920
he
diedâat
85
years
and
nine
months
Interspersed
in
Minor's
story
is
the
tale
of
the
editing
of
the
OED
Winchester's
story
has
an
abundance
of
mistakes
Herbert
Coleridge
the
first
editor
of
the
Philological
Society's
dictionary
was
not
the
poet's
grandson;
Elisabeth
Murray's
biography
was
only
taken
on
by
Oxford
after
Yale
University
Press
had
turned
it
into
bestseller
and
shamed
OUP
into
publishing
it
(OUP
having
earlier
rejected
it
as
unworthy)
There
are
lexical
curiosities
as
well
Bugger
grips
is
his
intriguing
term
for
what
others
might
call
muttonchops
or
burnsides;
he
believes
that
fulsome
means
exuberant
But
these
carpings
are
sour
grapes
Winchester
is
getting
very
rich
from
story
pretty
well
known
to
many
people
interested
in
dictionariesâparticularly
Elizabeth
Knowles
of
OUP
who
unearthed
basic
information
and
is
rightly
given
by
Winchester
what
he
would
call
fulsome
accolade
He
discovered
Minor
descendant
and
found
trove
of
correspondence
that
makes
the
story
much
richer
(and
more
factual)
than
what
was
otherwise
known
He
seems
to
have
overlooked
story
in
the
Springfield

headlined

Winchester

simple

Murray
should
arrive
at
the
gate
of
the
Asylum
imagining
it
is
some
private
residenceâalas
Winchester
tells
us
popular
myth
Murray
knew
that
Minor
was
in
the
asylum;
it
was
as
obvious
from
the
return
address
on
his
letters
as
Sing
Sing
would
have
been
to
an
American
counterpart
Minor
was
so
guilt-ridden
over
his
prodigious
sexual
appetites
that
he
committed
an
autopenectomy
reducing
his
organ
to
stub
that
extended
about
one
inch
from
its

These
are
alluring
possibilities
for

about

Richard
W
Bailey

On
the
So-called
Debate
over
Black
English
Perhaps
no
issue
better
illustrates
the
poverty
of
our
political
and
intellectual
culture
than
the
so-called
debate
over
Black
English
or
as
it
has
now
been
christened
Ebonics
The
confusions
are
many;
the
emotions
are
high
and
the
political
ramifications
obvious
It
may
be
of
interest
to
try
to
sort
some
of
the
issues
out
Language
or
Dialect?
The
Oakland
School
Board
proclaimed
that
Ebonics
was
language
and
that
teaching
English
to
speakers
of
Ebonics
was
an
exercise
in
bilingualism
comparable
in
principle
to
teaching
English
to
speakers
of
Spanish
or
Vietnamese
The
outcry
was
impassioned
and
predictably
hostile
The
debate
is
virtually
meaningless
Most
students
of
language
understand
that
whether
two
varieties
of
speech
are
considered
dialects
of
one
language
or
separate
languages
is
as
much
political
question
as
it
is
linguistic
one
So
for
example
the
varieties
of
Chinese
(Mandarin
Cantonese
etc.)
are
about
as
different
as
the
Romance
Languages
(Portuguese
Spanish
etc.)
That
one
group
is
referred
to
as
dialects
and
the
other
group
as
languages
has
more
to
do
with
national
boundaries
than
any
internal
feature
of
the
speech
varieties
themselves
One
linguist
characterized
language
as
dialect
with
an
army
and
navy
Bad
English
Much
of
the
debate
has
been
couched
in
terms
of
lowering
standards
the
dumbing-down
of
the
education
system
etc
For
example
in
syndicated
column
Ellen
Goodman
(Seattle
Times
December
27
1996)
snidely
compared
Black
English
be
with
French
Je
suis
and
characterized
the
former
as
merely
bad
English
as
opposed
to
valid
language
Even
the
most
superficial
analysis
of
any
speech
community
would
reveal
that
certain
varieties
of
speech
are
prestigious
and
others
are
stigmatized
and
that
what
determines
particular
variety's
status
has
virtually
nothing
to
do
with
the
internal
features
of
that
variety
and
everything
to
do
with
the
class
and
in
this
case
the
race
of
the
speakers
involved
In
short
the
issue
is
the
color
of
their
skin
not
the
color
of
their
vowels
But
the
confusions
are
deeper
and
more
insidious
was
on
recent
talk
show
where
the
host
referred
to
speakers
of
Black
English
as
illiterate
thugs
The
juxtaposition
of
the
two
terms
is
revealing
An
academic
feature
namely
literacy
is
assumed
to
correlate
with
moral
one
In
other
words
bad
English
is
what
is
spoken
by
bad
people
This
assumption
is
pervasive
in
our
society
Someone
who
speaks
prestigious
dialect
is
thereby
thought
to
be
honest
clean
trustworthy
and
admirable
friend
of
mine
used
to
teach
remedial
reading
in
the
New
York
public
school
system
The
class
was
for
students
who
had
repeatedly
failed
and
was
referred
to
as
the
last
class
before
jail
On
the
first
day
my
friend
would
tell
the
class
I'm
supposed
to
teach
you
how
to
read
But
let's
get
one
thing
straight;
Hitler
knew
how
to
read
and
my
grandmother
didn't
and
I'll
take
my
grandmother
any
time
The
difference
between
my
New
York
friend
and
the
radio
talk
show
host
is
crucial
Schooling
and
morality
are
not
synonymous
and
probably
show
virtually
no
significant
correlation
In
the
current
discussion
familiarity
with
the
prestige
dialect
does
not
correlate
with
moral
virtue
Some
Basic
Linguistics
On
this
issue
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
know
who
are
worse
the
intellectuals
or
the
bigots
Columnists
quote
scholars
who
insist
that
speakers
of
Black
English
are
careless
and
lazy
and
that
the
particular
variety
of
speech
involved
has
no
rules
That
positions
such
as
these
are
articulated
and
published
reflects
level
of
information
analogous
to
arguing
that
the
earth
is
flat
In
fact
an
example
of
how
rules
in
Black
English
differ
from
those
of
other
dialects
may
be
revealing
Consider
the
following
data
(I
hesitate
to
refer
to
dialects
as
standard
or
nonstandard
since
it
seems
to
me
to
give
the
game
away.)
In
one
dialect
of
English
the
plural
of
nouns
is
formed
by
adding
[s]
or
[z]
or
[\?\]
resulting
in
forms
like
[posts]
[boyz]
and
[bus\?\s]
for
posts
boys
and
buses
In
my
dialect
of
English
however
the
plural
of
post
is
pronounced
something
like
[poss]
The
simplest
mechanism
for
accounting
for
such
pronunciation
is
by
adding
phonological
rule
for
the
deletion
of
[t]
under
certain
circumstances
So
for
example
prints
and
prince
are
both
pronounced
[prins]
The
rule
in
fact
is
more
general
applying
to
[d]
as
well
Wines
and
winds
are
both
pronounced
[waynz]
Notice
however
that
the
rule
for
the
deletion
of
[t]
must
follow
the
rule
for
forming
the
plural
Otherwise
if
[t]
deletion
preceded
plural
formation
then
[post]
would
become
[pos]
and
the
plural
would
be
[pos\?\s]
Well
it
turns
out
that
for
many
speakers
of
Black
English
the
plural
of
post
is
in
fact
pronounced
[pos\?\s]
Why?
Because
they
have
essentially
the
same
rules
as
have
but
in
the
opposite
order
In
other
words
there
are
three
dialects:
Dialect
A:
Plural
formation
Dialect
B
Plural
formation
followed
by
[t]
deletion
Dialect
C
[t]
deletion
followed
by
plural
formation
Pedagogy
Now
imagine
the
average
teacher
of
reading
with
students
representing
each
of
the
three
speech
varieties
student
of
Dialect
A
sees
the
written
word
posts
and
pronounces
it
[posts]
The
teacher
beams;
that
child
can
get
to
be
president
student
of
Dialect
sees
the
written
word
posts
and
pronounces
it
[poss]
The
teacher
might
encourage
the
student
to
enunciate
more
clearly
Such
student
might
not
get
to
be
president
but
could
perhaps
aspire
to
be
Mayor
of
New
York
But
now
the
student
of
Dialect
sees
the
word
written
posts
and
pronounces
it
[pos\?\s]
The
teacher
is
confused
Get
that
student
an
eye-exam;
get
that
student
hot
lunch;
get
that
student
something
The
fact
is
that
such
student
has
demonstrated
the
ability
to
read
What
the
student
needs
is
better
teacher
And
ultimately
that's
one
thing
that
the
Oakland
School
Board
was
suggesting:
the
simple
commonsense
proposal
that
teachers
might
be
more
effective
if
they
knew
something
about
the
speech
patterns
of
the
people
they
were
trying
to
teach
Unfortunately
that
proposal
became
obscured
by
the
pointless
debate
over
whether
Black
English
is
or
is
not
language
History
Another
emotional
and
largely
irrelevant
debate
resulted
from
the
use
by
the
Oakland
School
Board
of
the
word
genetic
to
refer
to
Black
English
That
some
actually
took
this
to
mean
that
people
are
born
with
predisposition
to
acquire
particular
language
would
be
laughable
if
it
were
not
so
pernicious
(Some
years
ago
there
was
brief
article
in
the
newspaper
about
woman
from
Texas
who
had
adopted
Mexican
infant
and
was
studying
Spanish
so
that
she
would
be
able
to
speak
to
the
child
when
it
grew
up
She
was
equally
misinformed
but
not
as
malicious
as
the
current
critics
of
the
Oakland
School
Board.)
In
fact
the
origin
of
some
of
the
features
of
Black
English
is
of
some
theoretical
scholarly
interest
Slaves
in
this
country
were
systematically
separated
from
their
families
and
put
in
situations
where
they
could
not
use
their
native
language
In
such
situation
what
typically
develops
is
what
is
referred
to
as
pidgin
based
on
the
language
of
the
environment
in
this
case
English
The
next
generation
acquires
this
language
as
product
of
their
linguistic
maturation
and
this
variety
is
sometimes
called
creole
Over
the
succeeding
centuries
this
language
has
undergone
process
of
decreolization
for
obvious
reasons
Now
what
is
of
some
interest
is
that
because
slaves
in
other
countries
were
not
systematically
isolated
there
is
as
far
as
can
tell
no
such
thing
as
Black
Portuguese
in
Brazil
for
example
In
other
words
there
is
historical
explanation
for
the
emergence
of
Black
English
but
it
surely
has
little
relevance
to
the
current
educational
and
pedagogical
debate
It
still
remains
to
be
seen
whether
rational
coherent
language
policy
for
speakers
of
Black
English
can
evolve
in
our
educational
institutions
Given
the
emotional
and
uninformed
reaction
so
far
it
is
hard
to
be
optimistic
Revising
The
F-Word
Writing
book
entirely
about
the
word
fuck
aside
from
being
good
way
to
guarantee
cocktail-party
chatter
exposes
one
to
numerous
criticisms
Apart
from
the
tiresome
degradation
of
society
arguments
from
the
puritanical
everyone
is
familiar
with
this
word
in
its
many
forms
Newspapers
coyly
refer
to
it
with
euphemisms
and
circumlocutions
Tshirt
vendors
stock
shirts
emblazoned
with
its
many
parts
of
speech
And
everyone
has
favorite
passage
unusual
compound
or
offbeat
etymological
theory
to
promote
The
original
edition
of
The
F-Word
was
successful
project
It
included
almost
all
of
the
important
uses
of
the
word
and
the
introduction
gave
good
picture
of
the
word's
history
both
etymological
and
social
But
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
and
so
when
Random
House
determined
it
was
time
to
reprint
we
decided
that
major
revision
could
be
supported
The
revision
is
in
progress
at
the
time
of
this
writing
and
this
is
preliminary
report
on
where
things
stand
Historical
Interest
in
the
historical
aspect
of
the
word
fuck
has
always
been
high;
most
reviewers
cited
various
anecdotes
from
the
Introduction
We
have
accordingly
been
trying
to
research
and
add
any
relevant
or
interesting
story
The
earliest
example
of
fuck
appearing
in
ciphered
version
in
the
fifteenth-century
poem
Flen
Flyys
has
always
been
crowd-pleaser
since
it
is
not
only
in
codeâsuggesting
that
the
word
was
taboo
even
at
that
timeâbut
describes
monks
fucking
(Seemingly
popular
subject
for
that
eraâan
early
sixteenth
century
apostil
refers
to
the
poor
scribe's
fucking
abbot.)
The
original
edition
gave
sparse
details
on
the
background
of
this
poem
and
translated
the
cipher
without
explaining
it;
even
the
mainstream
American
Heritage
Dictionary
Third
Edition
gave
more
complete
treatment
In
the
new
edition
we
will
give
thorough
version
of
this
attestation
The
date
of
1926
for
the
first
openly
printed
use
of
fuck
in
Americaâstill
the
earliest
we
have
discoveredâprovoked
the
question
of
the
first
use
of
fuck
in
the
movies
We
are
still
researching
this
but
it
seems
that
fuck
first
appeared
in
mainstream
movies
around
1970
MASH
and
Myra
Breckenridge
);
it
had
been
used
earlier
in
several
avant-garde
films
Unlike
the
literary
world
where
provocative
books
such
as
Ulysses
or
Lady
Chatterley's
Lover
led
to
legal
battles
over
obscenity
issues
in
the
movies
no
one
tried
to
place
fuck
onto
film
until
the
country
was
ready
for
it
While
fuck
appeared
in
popular
periodicals
such
as
The
Atlantic
Monthly
Harper's
Magazine
Playboy
and
others
by
the
1960s
it
took
bit
more
time
for
the
word
to
um
penetrate
the
august
pages
of
The
New
Yorker
The
editorship
of
Tina
Brown
is
usually
creditedâmore
usually
faultedâ
with
that
journal's
frequent
use
of
the
word
and
though
writers
did
use
it
frequently
under
Ms
Brown
in
fact
fuck
appeared
there
spelled
in
full
in
1985
during
the
editorship
of
the
puritan
William
Shawn
in
short
story
by
Bobbie
Ann
Mason:
Maybe
you
have
to
find
out
for
yourself
Fuck
You
can't
learn
from
the
past
(June
3
1985
p
81)
The
etymology
of
fuck
has
never
ceased
inspiring
comment
The
various
purported
acronymic
origins
are
still
the
first
thing
most
people
think
of;
we
will
be
expanding
our
treatment
of
this
and
including
the
first
known
appearance
of
an
acronymic
etymology
(in
New
York's
underground
paper
The
East
Village
Other)
in
1967
The
most
striking
recent
development
has
been
the
popularity
of
the
pluck
yew
story
which
conflates
the
origin
of
fuck
with
an
earlier
piece
of
folklore
about
the
origin
of
the
offensive
backhand
two-finger
gesture
According
to
the
original
form
of
the
tale
before
the
battle
of
Agincourt
immortalized
in
Shakespeare's
Henry
V
the
French
taunted
the
English
longbowmen
by
waving
two
fingers
at
them
saying
that
those
fingers
(used
to
pull
back
the
bowstring)
could
never
defeat
the
mighty
French
After
the
English
annihilated
the
hapless
French
(10,000
dead
French
to
mere
29
Brits
by
Bill
S.'s
count)
the
English
responded
by
waving
their
two
fingers
back
at
the
French
in
the
now-familiar
gesture
(the
American
version
limits
it
to
the
single
middle
finger)
The
recent
twist
has
been
to
note
the
fact
that
longbows
are
traditionally
made
of
yew
wood
and
claim
that
the
act
of
drawing
the
bowstring
was
called
plucking
yew;
the
victorious
English
not
only
waved
their
fingers
at
the
French
but
shouted
We
can
still
pluck
yew!
Pluck
yew!
at
them
few
convenient
sound-changes
brought
us
to
our
familiar
phrase
fuck
you
This
story
totally
ludicrous
in
any
version
was
popularized
on
the
National
Public
Radio
segment
Car
Talk
where
it
was
meant
as
joke;
many
unfortunates
particularly
on
the
Internet
have
taken
it
seriously
It
will
be
debunked
On
the
serious
side
considerably
more
etymological
information
will
be
presented
The
editor
is
grateful
to
Anatoly
Liberman
for
sharing
the
entry
(and
bibliography)
for
fuck
from
his
magnificent
forthcoming
etymological
dictionary
Liberman
argues
convincingly
that
the
word
is
part
of
large
family
of
Germanic
words
having
the
form
[short
vowel]
[stop]
having
the
base
meaning
to
move
back
and
forth
(not
to
thrust
as
most
dictionaries
and
the
original
edition
of
The
F-Word
had
it)
It
is
probably
borrowing
from
Dutch
Low
German
or
Flemish
but
not
continuation
of
an
Old
English
word
He
finds
no
Indo-European
cognates
(of
Latin
futuo
he
notes
It
is
strange
coincidence
that
Latin
futuo
is
also
an
word)
On
the
less
serious
but
still
scholarly
side
we
will
refer
to
the
hilarious

The
omission
of
this
classic
first
published
in
1971
is
unforgivable
Least
forgivable
of
all
was
the
omission
of
Allen
Walker
Read's
1934
classic
An
Obscenity
Symbol
the
most
important
article
ever
written
on
fuck
despite
the
absence
of
that
word
from
the
article
itself
(a
not
uncommon
situation
in
the
field
might
add)
The
decision
of
the
editor
(who
even
now
is
hiding
behind
this
circumlocution
but
yes
it
was
me)
to
forgo
bibliography
should
not
have
prevented
him
from
acknowledging
this
indispensable
work
New
Words
and
Senses
moderate
number
of
new
words
or
phrases
and
smaller
number
of
new
senses
have
been
added
Several
readers
suggested
the
addition
of
that
'70s
hit
zipless
fuck
an
act
of
intercourse
without
an
emotional
connection
coined
by
Erica
Jong
in
Fear
of
Flying
We
had
originally
decided
to
omit
it
since
zipless
was
often
used
on
its
own
to
mean
passionate
but
emotionally
uninvolved
but
it
does
appear
often
enough
as
set
phrase
to
deserve
entry
Arnold
Zwicky
chief
editor
of
the

above
suggested
genderfuck
instance
of
reversal
of
normal
sex
roles;
(specifically)
transvestism
common
term
whose
absence
can
only
be
explained
using
the
Johnsonian
formula
in
answer
to
woman
who

asked
him
why

defined

as
the
knee
of
horse

Madam

Thanks
to
the
diligent
research
of
friends
and
colleagues
we
have
pushed
this
back
to
1973
with
frequent
cites
thereafter
Another
unfortunate
omission
was
fuck
buddy
sexual
partner
esp
friend
with
whom
one
engages
in
casual
sex
which
we
currently
have
found
to
1983
but
have
hopes
of
bettering
To

we
now
add
the

pleasant
hate

immortalized
as
the
title
of
the
first
album
of
post-punk
band
Pussy
Galore
in
1987
but
found
in
the
'70s
and
force-fuck
apparently
coined
because
the
word
rape
wasn't
shocking
enough
The
bizarre
lesbian
expression
fuckerware
party
gathering
for
the
group
use
of
sex
toys
seems
contrary
to
expectations
to
be
real;
the
definition
of
fist-fuck
originally
limited
to
anal
fisting
has
been
widened
(with
citations)
to
allow
for
vaginal
fisting
as
well
More
recent
additions
are
new
sense
of
ratfuck
busy
party
marked
by
flagrant
social
climbing;
insults
such
as
fuckball
and
fuckrag
(popularized
in
the

Scream
);
and
number
of
marginal
uses
whose
admission
is
being
debated
including
fuck-trash
loathsome

and
fuck
monster
promiscuous
person
esp
woman
British
and
Australian
terms
omitted
on

grounds
from
the

are
now
being
includedâand
why
not
with

this
widespread?

to

in
the

as
being

it
has
been
used
since
the
1960s)
statement
rejected
by
numerous
correspondents
who
testified
to
their
activities
in
thusly
named
vehicles
in
the
U.S
of
A.;
two
people
noted
that
the
word
was
also
used
for
bus
on
which
one
can
meet
prospective
sexual
partners
(both
curiously
referring
to
shuttle
between
Wellesley
College
and
the
Harvard
and
M.I.T
campuses)
Many
of
these
new
items
came
from
suggestions
but
most
suggestions
were
ultimately
useless
Everyone
and
his
or
her
brother
or
sister
it
seems
has
favorite
fuck
-related
usage
And
in
most
cases
these
appear
to
be
expressions
doomed
to
the
nonce
world
The
introduction
to
the
first
edition
listed
several
such
words
suggested
by
colleagues
such
as
clothesfuck
difficulty
in
deciding
what
clothes
to
wear
and
fuckbreak
leave
of
absence
from
work
in
order
to
get
pregnant
(two
other
terms
from
this
section
fuckload
large
amount
and
fuck-muscle
the
penis
were
omitted
for
insufficient
evidence
but
will
now
be
added)
Publication
brought
blizzard
of
ever
more
outrageous
suggestions
including
(but
not
limited
to)
fuckadocio
fuck-a-doodle-doo
and
fuck-aroni
whose
meanings
can
only
be
guessed
at
Many
suggestions
also
failed
to
respect
the
nature
of
the
definitions;
several
readers
commented
on
the
absence
of
un-fucking-believable
which
appears
under
-fucking-

which
is

Antedatings
As
most
users
of
historical
dictionaries
know
the
search
for
antedatingsâcitations
earlier
than
those
previously
known
for
word
or
senseâis
crucial
effort
Early
examples
force
us
to
rethink
what
we
thought
we
knew
about
the
historical
development
of
language
The
original
work
for
The
F-Word
proved
that
fuck
was
used
in
variety
of
figurative
senses
far
earlier
than
had
previously
been
believed
and
that
certain
expressions
were
years
or
decades
older
than
anyone
had
realized
The
number
of
antedatings
we
have
found
in
the
last
several
years
has
been
small
which
is
both
good
(in
validating
the
quality
of
our
original
research)
and
bad
(no
breakthroughs)
The
insulting
epithets
fuckface
and
fuckhead
were
originally
first
cited
in
1961
and
1962
respectively
Several
of
the
citations
referred
to
World
War
Two
and
euphemistic
1940
example
of
fuckfaced
suggested
that
these
terms
were
in
use
in
the
1940s
Happily
we
found
solid
1945
citations
in
an
article
published
in
this
magazine
in
1989âan
article
we
had
read
without
catching
these
cites
This
article
also
provided
significant
antedating
for
N.F.G
no
fucking
good
an
abbreviation
accidentally
omitted
from
The
F-Word
but
included
in
the
book's
parent
work
with
first
cite
from
1977
The
compound
fuck-me
intended
to
invite
sexual
advances
chiefly
exemplified
by
fuck-me
[shoes]
(with
various
specific
types
of
shoes)
was
only
attested
to
1989
Several
reliable
sources
claimed
familiarity
to
the
1960s
and
1970s
and
we
were
able
to
confirm
this
with
1974
citation
from
the
musician
David
Bowie
The
expression
fuck-you
money
unknown
to
the
editor
before
reader
letter
called
it
to
attention
was
first
cited
to
1986
thanks
to
search
of
the
Nexis
database
colleague
subsequently
discovered
1976
example
M.F
euphemistic
form
of
motherfucker
had
been
attested
to
1964;
we
found
1959
example
buried
in
Robert
Gold's
excellent
Jazz
Lexicon
Finally
the
best
we
had
been
able
to
do
on
titfuck
was
1986;
Nexis
search
came
up
with
Playboy
example
from
1984
which
inspired
check
of
Robert
Wilson's
1972
Playboy's
Book
of
Forbidden
Words
which
indeed
had
it
The
second
definition
of
fuckable
sexually
available
with
single
1977
example
was
pushed
back
to
1972
in
Bruce
Rodgers's
Queens'
Vernacular
which
also
supplied
first
cite
for
mouthfuck
verb
An
important
goal
of
the
revision
has
been
to
include
any
famous
use
of
relevant
forms
of
fuck
In
the
original
version
we
were
content
to
have
good
smattering
of
examples
from
the
earliest
to
the
most
recent
but
as
long
as
the
examples
were
genuine
attestations
we
were
satisfied
(Preference
is
given
to
actual
examples
in
running
text
then
to
printed
glossarial
evidence
and
finally
to
orally
collected
examples.)
Now
we
have
made
an
effort
to
extend
our
evidence
from
important
or
interesting
sources
Thus
we
have
added
the
famous
scene
in
Catcher
in
the
Rye
where
Holden
sees
fuck
you
graffito
and
muses
on
his
desire
to
protect
his
little
sister
Phoebe
from
seeing
such
vulgarity
Another
important
citation
is
from
Allen
Ginsberg's
Howl
where
he
has
seen
The
best
minds
in
my
generation
destroyed
by
madness,...who
let
themselves
be
fucked
in
the
ass
by
saintly
motorcyclists
and
screamed
with
joy
Bufu
homosexual
man
portmanteau
from
butt
fucker
was
already
in
with
first
citation
from
1982
Valley
Girl
dictionary
but
we
have
added
the
use
in
the
defining
text
of
that
subculture
Frank
Zappa's
Valley
Girl:
Like
my
English
teacherâHe's
like
Mr
Bufu...He
like
flirts
with
all
the
guys
in
the
class
Under
fuck
up
we
have
added
the
well-known
opening
lines
to
Philip
Larkin's
poem
This
be
the
Verse
the
only
use
of
fuck
to
be
regularly
found
in
dictionaries
of
quotations:
They
fuck
you
up
your
mum
and
dad
They
may
not
mean
to
but
they
do
And
for
the
literal
sense
we
learn
from
Liz
Phair
that
want
to
fuck
you
like
dog...I'll
fuck
you
till
your
dick
turns
blue
The
regular
program
of
gathering
new
evidence
combined
with
database
searches
for
underattested
forms
has
delivered
an
impressive
return
of
citations
We
have
four
instead
of
two
examples
of
fubar
in
the
secondary
sense
drunk;
up-to-date
examples
for
give
fuck
fuck
act
of
sexual
intercourse
fuckable
fuck-all
fuckboy
fuckfest
and
others;
valuable
third
cite
for
fuck
an
evil
turn
of
events;
more
florid
entries
in
the
stronger
more
vivid
or
more
elaborate
curses
section
and
newly
fleshed-out
entries
for
fuckee
in
both
literal
and
figurative
senses
This
evidence
proves
that
these

words

in

use
in
the
English-speaking
world
We
have
tried
to
keep
deletions
to
minimum
chiefly
by
not
including
marginal
terms
in
the
first
place
Any
item
with
two
or
more
examples
may
be
considered
secure;
an
item
from
single
non-glossarial
source
that
parallels
an
existing
expression
may
also
be
considered
secure;
an
item
with
only
single
glossarial
citation
would
have
been
kept
out
unless
confirming
example
could
be
solicited
An
included
marginal
term
then
would
be
one
from
single
oral
or
written
source
that
does
not
parallel
another
term
and
appears
in
this
editor's
opinion
to
be
unlikely

in

we

This
(second)Â¹

of
the

at
the

covers
the
last
seven
years
at
Fairleigh
Dickinson

(FDU

but
includes
some

read
at

since
1986
at
John

(New

Dedicated
to
Margaret
M

the

has
four
subdivisions:
I

III
Personal

and
IV
Various
Other
Names
I
Geographic

is
further
divided
into
1)
International
Names
and
2)
Names
in
the
United
States
The
contributions
of
three
members
of
the
US
Board
on
Geographic
Names
(BGN)
namely
Richard
R
Randall
Meredith
F
Burrill
and
Donald
J
Orth
give
very
good
and
welcome
insight
into
practical
aspects
of
placename-giving
In
Political
Changes
and
New
Names
Dr
Randall
pays
particular
attention
to
both
the
new
names
of
politically
changed
countries
and
also
to
the
problems
arising
when
we
try
to
record
native
names
(as
in
transcription)
In
Motive
in
Placenaming
Donald
Orth
discusses
motivation
in
naming
location
and
illustrates
his
point
with
very
appropriate
quote
from
Mysterious
Island
by
Jules
Verne
He
mentions
for
example
names
that
honor
persons
names
that
have
religious
background
names
that
express
ego
gratification
and
toponymic
habituation
(in
which
familiar
names
from
the
homeland
are
adopted
to
make
place
seem
little
less
strange)
names
which
show
evidence
of
discovery
etc
He
stresses
however
that
The
motives
themselves
may
be
explicit
or
subconscious
but
their
conjunction
at
given
moment
is
normally
unpremeditated
Even
though
they
may
be
considered
separate
events
there
is
direct
linkage
between
the
motive
to
name
and
the
name
given
In
fact
it
is
difficult
to
consider
one
without
the
other
They
are
capable
of
reinforcing
one
another
in
number
of
ways
(p
23.)
Part
of
the
first
section
opens
with
reprint
of
Allen
Walker
Read's
onomastic
history
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
which
is
followed
by
very
lengthy
paper
on
No
Names
in
the
United
States
In
the
latter
work
Robert
M
Rennick
professes
that
it
is
only
an
introduction
to
the
subject
and
asks
for
more
information
so
that
more
extensive
research
can
be
done
However
in
this
work
the
author
is
unable
to
convince
this
reader
of
the
need
for
more
such
research
and
think
the
paper
would
have
benefitted
very
much
from
an
abridged
presentation
On
the
other
hand
Dr
Burrill's
article
on
Toponomy
and
Cultural
History
is
very
good
example
of
how
toponomy
(and
lexicography
in
general)
and
history
can
benefit
from
each
other
Each
culture
group
has
its
own
ways
of
looking
at
nature
its
own
set
of
distinctions
between
things
in
general
class
and
its
own
rigid
boundaries
to
thought
that
are
posed
by
its
language
Including
terms
for
artifacts
of
all
kinds
that
are
useful
cultural
clues
these
elements
are
reflected
in
toponyms
(p
114-115.)
The
author
describes
the
use
of
specific
terms
and
the
problems
associated
with
them
beginning
with
the
word
swamp
which
is
followed
by
creek
folly
tump
and
gurnet
Especially
he
says
the
comparison
of
the
use
of
these
words
in
the
colonies
and
in
the
respective
homelands
has
promising
results
Benjamin
Nunez's
historical
study
Proto-Portuguez
Toponymics
on
the
West
African
Coast
in
the
Fifteenth
Century
speaks
for
itself
and
the
same
may
be
said
for
the
optimistic
and
thoughtful
remarks
of
Alan
Rayburn's
Promoting
the
Study
of
Names
As
Scholarly
Discipline
in
North
America
II
The
editor
introduces
this
sectionâ
Names
in
Literatureâby
stating
the
purpose
of
it
namely
which
is
to
ask
if
the
study
of
imaginary
personages
and
places
does
not
properly
belong
to
onomastics
(p
127.)
This
section
contains
papers
about
Bret
Easton
Ellis'
Less
than
Zero
(Leonard
R.N
Ashley);
Charlotte
BrontÃ«'s
Jane
Eyre
(Lynn
Hamilton);
Anna
Seghers'
Revolt
of
the
Fishers
(Russell
E
Brown)
MoliÃ¨re's
Le
Malade

(Betty
J
Davis)
Baltasar
GraciÃ¡n's
El

(Catherine

and
Names
Prime
Evil:

of
Horror
and
Fear
in
the

of
Sir

and

d'Aurevilly
(Maxine
M
Bernard)
One
of
the
most
readable
of
these
articles
is
Russell
E
Brown's
paper
on
Anna
Seghers'
Revolt
of
the
Fishers
in
which
he
shows
how
the
author
establishes
certain
universality
for
the
uprising:
accordingly
the
names
can
be
attributed
to
no
specific
place
or
time
It
seems
that
the
Bretonic
language
is
not
only
the
major
source
of
character
names
here
but
Low
German
and
Dutch
also
play
part
Brown
emphasizes
that
the
last
two
languages
have
lot
of
names
and
spellings
in
common
However
the
source
Brown
uses
for
Dutch
names
is
hardly
adequate:
Van
der
Aa's
biographical
dictionary
only
describes
well-known
Dutch
persons
and
isn't
meant
to
be
an
overview
of
all
the
surnames
in
use
For
that
information
one
should
turn
to
the
Nederlands
Repertorium
van
Familienamen
edited
by
P.J
Meertens
and
others
in
fourteen
volumes
(Assen
Van
Gorcum
1963-1988)
Nevertheless
Brown's
description
of
the
author's
choice
of
pen
name
and
her
symbolical
use
of
the
name
Marie
in
her
novel
are
excellent
examples
of
the
relevance
of
literary
name
studies
The
paper
of
Maxine
M
Bernard
covers
the
work
of
two
authors
Sir
Walter
Scott
and
Barbey
d'Aurevilly
but
because
of
this
broad
span
her
conclusions
are
not
always
very
convincing
For
example
this
is
her
interpretation
of
one
of
Barbey's
religious
monsters
(the
seductor
and
rapist
of
an
innocent
country
girl
in
Nameless
Story
):
The
name
Riculf
seems
to
be
clever
composite
of
two
French
words:
rire
meaning
to
laugh
comes
directly
from
the
Latin
rictus
meaning
mocking
sneering
laughter;
and
culer
meaning
to
back
away
or
go
astray
His
persona
was
just
such
type:
mocking
God
leading
others
astray
scornfully
getting
away
(p
219.)
She
doesn't
mention
that
this
name
is
perfectly
normal
Germanic
name
which
consists
of
rik-
mighty
and
-ulf
wolf
which
is
itself
rather
colourful
name
for
scoundrel
The
French
connection
that
Bernard
suggests
seems
to
me
rather
farfetched
and
certainly
needs
more
proof
e.g.
from
significant
quotations
of
the
novel
itself
would
go
no
farther
than
point
out
possible
double
meaning
and
certainly
would
not
proclaim
the
French
interpretation
the
only
one
but
would
mention
it
only
as
possible
secondary
meaning

The
contributors
to
Personal
Names
are

B
Harder
Herbert
Barry
Aylene
S
Harper
A
Ross
Eckler
Penelope
Scambly
Schott
and
Dorothy
E
Litt
Harder's
Literary
Names
Mainstreamed
As
Given
Names
is
very
insightful:
How
many
parents
realize
that
the
currently
popular
Jennifer
is
derived
from
Guinevere
(King
Arthur's
adulterous
queen)
or
that
the
name
Pamela
became
popular
through
Samuel
Richardson's
Pamela;
or
Virtue
Rewarded
(1740)?
As
the
author
states
Naming
now
seldom
reflects
reading
(p
231)
Barry
and
Harper's
article
about
Sex
Differences
in
Linguistic
Origins
of
Personal
Names
is
to
the
point
and
thorough
An
important
point
they
make
is
that
although
names
nowadays
are
often
chosen
without
knowledge
of
their
linguistic
roots
and
meanings
the
linguistic
background
nevertheless
persists
as
an
important
basis
for
selection:
books
of
names
generally
provide
information
about
roots
and
meanings
and
as
long
as
these
books
are
read
and
used
the
knowledge
of
these
works
will
form
part
of
the
choice
(p
251.)
In
Eckler's
paper
on
Single-Letter
Surnames
we
learn
that
all
letters
exist
as
surname
(and
are
overwhelmingly
likely
to
be
held
by
people
of
Oriental
ancestry
p
264)
and
only
is
missing
The
paper
by
Penelope
Scambly
Schott
Rosamond:
Poison
and
Contamination
gives
neat
example
of
historical
confusion
based
on
the
fate
of
another
individual
with
the
same
name
Thus
the
fair
Rosamond
of
English
literatureâHenry
II's
mistress
who
died
in
1176âwas
(also
said
to
be)
poisoned
to
death
in
1592
not
in
the
flesh
but
on
the
page
It
isn't
clear
to
this
reviewer
just
what
place
the
Litt
article
Self-Naming
and
Self-Defining
in
Subscriptions
to
Familiar
Letters
in
the
English
Renaissance
is
supposed
to
have
in
onomastics
The
author
explicitly
refrains
from
examples
of
nomination
in
code
names
code-numbered
names
anonyms
pet
names
name-changing
and
other
onomastic
oddities
in
this
material
(p
285)
Yet
these
elements
seem
to
be
more
related
to
onomastics
than
those
she
has
described
in
this
paper
and
therefore
make
the
reader
anxious
to
know
more
IV
Various
Other
Names
The
paper
section
of
the
book
ends
with
this
general
category
which
includes
articles
by
Douglas
P
Hinkle
Roger
W
Wescott
Walter
P
Bowman
Thomas
L
Bernard
and
E
Wallace
McMullen
While
Dr
Hinkle
admits
he
has
barely
scratched
the
surface
in
his
article
yet
in
Street-Language
Naming
Practices
in
the
Hispanic
Drug
and
Underworld
Subcultures
he
goes
into
great
detail
and
tells
us
quite
bit
(e.g.
that
snort
of
cocaine
is
called
narizÃ³n
from
the
Spanish
nariz
nose
which
compares
to
English
slang
snootful)
Anyone
curious
about
technical
linguistics
will
take
delight
in
Wescott's
comments
on
The
Phonology
of
Proper
Names
in
English
He
is
of
the
opinion
that
slang
has
formal
as
well
as
semantic
peculiarities
and
that
names
resemble
slang
in
this
respect
(p
301)
Thus
he
tells
us
names
can
exhibit
phonetic
alternation
An
example
is
the
sequence
Jean
Jen(n)y
Jane
Jan(et)
John
and
Joan
(ultimately
derived
from
single
Biblical
Hebrew
name
meaning
Jehovah's
mercy)
He
also
mentions
the
four
types
of
palindromization
(two
will
suffice
here):
progressive
additive:
pap<pa
or
paw;
and
regressive
additive:
Nan<Ann
or
Anna
Thus
good
number
of
common
changes
are
explained
for
us
For
example
one
extreme
lexical
transformation
is
the
nickname
Poll
which
is
derived
from
Mary
in
which
the
has
been
both
occluded
and
unvoiced
the
has
been
retracted
the
has
been
lingualized
and
the
has
been
dropped
(p
306.)
According
to
Bowman
Musical
Names:
The
Titles
of
Symphonies
is
beginning
on
an
abundant
onomastic
field
Among
those
already
well-known
Berlioz's
Symphonie
Fantastique
appears
at
first
to
be
an
instrument
of
revenge
against
one
heartless
lady
and
(using
the
same
title)
also
means
of
admiration
directed
toward
his
future
fiancÃ©e
Bowman
describes
how
composers
have
used
placenames
to
express
feelings
evoked
by
visits
(e.g.
Dvorak's
From
the
New
World)
or
to
express
nationalistic
or
patriotic
regard
for
homeland
(e.g.
Hindemith's
Pittsburgh
Symphony)
Personal
names
as
well
as
political
events
or
dates
function
in
symphony
titles
Also
literature
has
left
its
mark
(e.g.
Liszt's
Faust)
Bowman
concludes
his
paper
with
some
fascinating
oddities
In
Thomas
Bernard's
Names
Nationality
and
the
Incongruity
Factor
our
attention
is
called
to
the
fact
that
good
number
of
people
have
names
that
don't
seem
to
correspond
with
their
nationality
One
example
will
suffice:
until
recently
one
wouldn't
assume
that
someone
with
the
name
Fujimori
would
be
Peruvian
The
last
article
in
the
volume

the

all:
the

has
extensive

contains

Lost

(Eheu

Last

as
was

my
notes
on
solecisms
called
from
television
radio
and
newspapers
suddenly
realized
that
updating
the
long

had
begun
to
take
up

time

so
had
always
thought

however
paused

labors
after

stint
of
alphabetizing
and
partially
annotating

Already
while
working
my

to

on
the
above
examples
and
others
too
humorous
to
mention
had
been
visited
by
fond
memories
of
Jane
and
Goodman
Ace
those
masters
of
malapropismâthough
according
to
an
article
in
The
New
Yorker
which
read
years
ago
Goodman
was
the
master;
Jane
was
real-life
Mrs
Malaprop
had
made
list
of
the
Jane
Aceisms
in
that
article
still
had
that
list
and
now
rather
than
just
sitting
there
like
bum

compared
Jane's
words
with
my
own

record
of
unstrung
and
unlamented
lapses
many
still
to
be

in

When
had
at

poured
over
the
two
listsâ
the
one
so
much
too
brief;
the
other
so
much

you
could
have
knocked
me

that

Where
to
Go
Amsterdam
is
small
city
and
eminently
walkable
though
if
you
only
have
short
time
take
advantage
of
the
tram
system
which
will
transport
you
efficiently
to
all
the
most
important
attractions
Circle
Tram
20
links
them
all
on
one
route
and
runs
at
10-minute
intervals
throughout
the
day
from
the
central
station
Perhaps
the
most
disconcerting
thing
for
the
newcomer
is
how
to
find
your
way
around
The
City
center
can
seem
at
first
like
maze
of
tiny
streets
and
canals
with
no
overall
plan;
however
in
some
ways
it
works
very
much
like
the
plan
of
spiderâs
web
and
once
you
understand
the
structure
of
the
town
plan
it
is
relatively
easy
to
get
around
The
central
core
around
Dam
Square
is
horseshoe-shaped
and
consists
of
series
of
wide
streetsÂ âÂ the
main
one
is
the
Damrak/Rokin
which
cuts
the
centerÂ âÂ and
narrow
alleys
It
also
has
some
of
the
oldest
waterways
once
so
important
for
the
delivery
of
goods
from
around
the
Dutch
colonial
world
This
area
is
ringed
by
girdle
of
canals
the
major
ones
are
called
grachts
running
outward
in
ever
larger
circles
Singel
was
once
the
outer
barrier
for
the
medieval
city
but
as
the
city
expanded
Herengracht
(Gentlemanâs
Canal)
Keizersgracht
(Emperorâs
Canal)
and
Prinsengracht
(Princesâ
Canal)
enlarged
the
web
Incidentally
if
you
do
feel
lost
or
confused
when
strolling
remember
that
these
three
canals
are
set
in
alphabetical
order:
H
K
and
P
Small
streets
(straats)
radiate
out
from
the
center
crossing
the
canals
by
means
of
the
thousands
of
bridges
which
are
such
distinctive
part
of
the
city
landscape
To
the
north
of
the
city
centerÂ âÂ the
IJ
becomes
the
IJsselmeer
(a
former
route
to
the
North
Sea
now
dammed);
west
of
the
IJ
at
this
point
is
the
NoordzeekanalÂ âÂ Amsterdamâs
present-day
route
to
the
open
sea
We
have
divided
the
city
into
four
sections
which
are
easy
to
follow
on
foot
We
have
started
in
the
center
of
the
city
where
you
will
be
able
to
take
your
bearings
obtain
whatever
information
you
need
from
the
VVV
Tourist
information
office
and
take
canal
boat
tour
This
is
one
of
the
most
exciting
ways
to
get
an
overview
of
historic
Amsterdam
and
to
see
the
true
beauty
of
the
city
The
Center
Central
AmsterdamÂ âÂ what
was
once
the
Medieval
cityÂ âÂ is
very
small
indeed
The
port
was
the
lifeblood
of
the
city
at
that
time
and
ships
would
sail
right
into
the
heart
of
Amstelredamme
as
it
was
then
known
Today
only
few
architectural
gems
are
left
to
remind
us
of
this
era
but
the
tangle
of
narrow
alleyways
gives
feel
of
the
hustle
and
bustle
which
must
have
accompanied
the
traders
The
decision
to
locate
the
Central
Station
on
the
site
of
the
old
harbor
wall
was
the
final
death
knell
of
maritime
trade
for
the
city
It
stopped
large
cargo
ships
from
landing
their
catches
and
diminished
the
importance
of
the
canal
systems
The
station
opened
in
1889
dominates
the
view
up
Damrak
The
impressive
building
was
designed
by
PJH
Cuypers
who
was
also
responsible
for
the
design
of
the
Rijksmuseum
and
sits
on
three
artificial
islands
supported
by
8,687
wooden
piles
Across
the
wide
Stationplein
in
front
of
the
entrance
you
will
find
large
VVV
Amsterdam
Tourist
Office
where
you
can
get
information
buy
transport
tickets
make
hotel
reservations
or
book
theater
tickets
The
office
is
housed
in
the
rebuilt
Noord
Zuid
Koffiehuis
which
was
rebuilt
in
1981
from
the
plans
of
the
original
This
was
demolished
when
the
metro
was
constructed
in
1911
You
will
also
find
canal
tour
boats
moored
here
and
thousands
of
bicycles
waiting
for
their
riders
Walk
over
the
square
towards
the
city
and
as
you
cross
the
canal
bridge
look
to
your
left
to
see
the
distinctive
spires
of
Sint
Nicolaaskerk
(Saint
Nicholas
Church)
Sint
Nicolaas
is
an
important
saint
for
Amsterdam
being
patron
of
the
city
and
of
seafarers
This
Catholic
Church
replaced
many
of
the
secret
chapels
which
were
built
for
worship
during
the
period
of
Catholic
persecution
and
was
completed
in
1887
Once
over
the
bridge
you
will
find
yourself
on
Damrak
This
wide
boulevard
was
formerly
major
docking
area
for
sailing
boats
from
the
colonies
On
your
left
you
will
find
the
marina
area
full
of
glass-topped
tour
boats
To
your
right
the
street
side
is
lined
with
fast
food
cafÃ©s
giving
it
slightly
down
at
the
heels
appearance
Just
beyond
the
tour
boats
at
the
head
of
Damrak
is
the
Beurs
van
Berlage
the
old
stock
exchange
Its
refined
modern
lines
were
revelation
when
it
opened
in
1903
and
excited
much
debate
in
the
city
Unfortunately
it
didnât
excite
traders
quite
as
much
and
is
now
used
as
concert
and
exhibition
hall
featuring
everything
from
chamber
music
to
modern
art
The
warren
of
streets
to
the
left
of
the
Beurs
building
is
what
Amsterdammers
call
Oude
Zijd
or
Old
Side
and
this
area
constituted
the
old
warehouse
district
in
medieval
times
The
narrow
alleyways
are
darker
than
in
more
modern
parts
of
the
city
and
the
houses
appear
even
narrower
and
taller
Dominating
the
streets
is
the
imposing
Gothic
basilica
of
Oude
Kerk
(Old
Church)
As
its
name
suggests
Oude
Kerk
is
the
earliest
Parish
church
in
Amsterdam;
work
began
on
it
at
the
start
of
the
13th
century
when
Amstelredamme
was
only
just
starting
as
trading
town
Over
the
following
three
centuries
the
church
saw
several
extensions
as
the
population
of
the
city
grew
until
it
took
on
the
interesting
and
rather
over-busy
shape
it
is
todayÂ âÂ with
several
chapels
adding
gables
to
the
original
structure
In
its
early
life
it
was
more
than
church
acting
as
marketplace
and
hostel
for
the
poor
and
needy
Once
inside
the
sheer
scale
of
the
church
is
immediate
and
impressive
Commemorative
tombstones
cover
the
floor
including
that
of
Saskia
Rembrandtâs
wife
The
stained
glass
windows
are
also
impressive
One
commemorates
the
Peace
of
Munster
and
shows
Spanish
official
handing
over
the
charter
recognizing
the
independent
Dutch
State
Several
of
the
windows
show
Bible
scenes
on
majestic
scale
but
look
also
for
the
simple
red
door
above
which
is
written
the
advice
âmarry
in
haste
repent
at
leisure.â
The
canalside
streets
of
Oudezijds
Voorburgwal
and
Oudezijds
Achterburg
southwest
of
Oude
Kerk
are
home
to
the
infamous
Amsterdam
Red
Light
District
known
to
Amsterdammers
as
the
Walletjes
or
âlittle
walls.â
As
with
any
large
port
prostitution
was
rife
from
the
earliest
times
and
although
the
Calvinist
Protestants
tried
to
stamp
it
out
it
has
thrived
to
the
present
day
What
makes
the
situation
different
in
Amsterdam
in
modern
times
is
that
the
industry
has
been
legitimized
and
regulated
in
an
attempt
to
curb
the
most
disturbing
facets
of
exploitation
and
in
order
to
address
health
concerns
The
prostitutes
are
entitled
to
regular
health
checks
and
are
expected
to
pay
taxes
on
their
earningsÂ âÂ yet
another
example
of
the
Dutch
peopleâs
trademark
pragmatic
approach
when
it
comes
to
tackling
societyâs
difficult
issues
The
area
is
safeÂ âÂ except
perhaps
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morningÂ âÂ and
filled
with
tourists
The
tree-lined
canals
and
old
narrow
iron
bridges
are
some
of
the
prettiest
in
the
city
and
prostitutes
ply
their
trade

discreet

Jan

in

Following

in

Catholics
were
not
permitted
to
practice
their
religion
and
HartmanÂ âÂ along
with
number
of
other
wealthy
Catholics
of
the
timeÂ âÂ had

where
his

Although

at

this

now
the

because
of
its

Southeast
of
Oude

you
will
walk
through
the
small
Chinese
Quarter
to
reach
Waag
This
is
one
of
the
oldest
buildings
in
the
city
and
was
opened
in
1488
as
city
gate
marking
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
city
along
the
new
wall
built
after
the
disastrous
fire
in
the
1450s
The
numerous
turrets
and
rounded
tower
give
it
the
look
of
fairytale
castle
but
it
has
had
more
colorful
history
Public
executions
were
held
here
in
the
16th
century
with
the
condemned
being
kept
in
small
cell
on
the
ground
floor
before
they
met
their
fate
From
the
early
17th
century
it
became
the
weigh
house
(the
name
Waaggebouw
means
âweigh
houseâ)
for
cargoes
entering
or
leaving
the
city
down
the
Geldersekade
Canal
to
its
north
The
upper-floor
rooms
were
taken
by
various
tradesâ
guilds
for
their
meetings
and
for
oneÂ âÂ the
Guild
of
SurgeonsÂ âÂ it
was
used
for
practical
medical
research
including
experiments
with
cadavers
Rembrandt
created
two
canvasses
for
the
Guild
of
Surgeons
which
have
become
two
of
his
most
famous
paintings
The
Anatomy
Lesson
of
Dr
Tulp
and
The
Anatomy
Lesson
of
Dr
Diejman
both
show
scenes
from
guild
activities
at
the
Waag
and
were
hung
here
on
their
completion
In
the
early
19th
century
the
weigh
house
closed
and
Waag
had
number
of
less
illustrious

it
even
spent

City
scholars
are
divided
as
to
the
reason
for
the
towerâs
name
Some
say
it
comes
from
the
word
schreien
which
means
âweepingâ
as
it
was
place
where
sailorsâ
weeping
wives
came
to
wave
their
men
off
to
sea
Other
say
that
the
name
is
derivation
of
scherpe

means
âsharpâÂ âÂ denoting

and
space
for
him
to
teach
his
numerous
pupils
He
lived
with
his
wife
and
infant
son
on
the
first
floor
The
whole
house
was
restored
in
the
late
1990s
including
the
studio
and
the
painterâs
kunstkamer
or
cabinet
to
re-create
the
early
1600s
as
faithfully
as
possible
Over
250
of
the
artistâs
etchings
have
been
beautifully
presented
on
the
upper
floors
of
the
house
Unfortunately
Rembrandt
was
not
able
to
live
out
his
life
in
his
home
His
lack
of
financial
acumen
and
love
of
expensive
objects
caused
him
to
become
bankrupt
in
1656
and
he
had
to
sell
all
his
possessions
including
the
house
in
1660
Het
Rembrandthuis
has
as
neighbor
one
of
the
most

in
the

Southeast
Running
parallel
to
Jodenbreestraat
on
the
left-hand
side
is
Waterlooplein
named
after
the
famous
battle
and
home
to
the
famous
flea
market
of
the
same
name
Every
day
youâll
find
an
eclectic
mix
of
second-hand
crockery
clothes
and
electrical
equipment
on
sale
along
with
cotton
clothes
from
India
or
Indonesia
The
eastern
end
of
the
market
square
is
dominated
by
the
twin
spires
of
Mozes
en
AÃ¤ronkerk
(Moses
and
Aaron
Church)
Catholic
Church
built
in
1840
on
the
site
of
secret
chapel
The
Old
Testament
figures
of
Moses
and
Aaron
were
found
depicted
on
gable
stones
in
the
original
building
and
were
set
into
the
wall
of
the
new
edifice
The
fine
towers
are
actually
wood
rather
than
stone
They
were
painted
to
match
the
sandstone
walls
in
1990
restoration
WaterloopleinÂ âÂ and
its
marketÂ âÂ used
to
be
much
larger
but
massive
building
project
begun
in
the
early
1980s
cut
its
size
considerably
Protesters
deplored
the
loss
of
several
old
canal
houses
fringing
the
square
which
constituted
much
of
what
was
left
of
the
old
Jewish
Quarter
Nevertheless
the
construction
went
ahead
and
the
result
of
this
labor
is
the
Muziek
Theater
and
Stadhuis
the
front
faÃ§ade
and
entrance
of
which
sits
majestically
on
the
Amstel
River
The
attractive
glass-fronted
building
was
opened
in
1986
It
is
home
to
the
Netherlands
Opera
and
the
National
Ballet
and
also
hosts
range
of
traveling
companies
in
what
is
the
largest
auditorium
in
the
Netherlands
Amsterdammers
have
christened
this
combination
of
town
hall
and
theater
the
âstoperaâ
(staduis+opera)
The
Amstel
River
has
always
been
major
artery
through
the
city
and
even
today
you
will
see
large
amount
of
commercial
traffic
passing
along
the
waterway
From
the
terrace
and
walkway
around
the
Muziek
Theater
there
are
wonderful
views
of
the
boats
and
the
canal
houses
bordering
the
water
The
bridge
in
front
of
Muziek
Theater
provides
wonderful
view
down
the
river
and
is
also
one
of
the
most
interesting
bridges
in
Amsterdam
Blauwbrug
(Blue
Bridge)
is
named
after
the
color
of
the
previous
bridge
which
occupied
the
site
The
present
bridge
dating
from
1880
is
based
on
Pont
Alexander
III
in
Paris
and
is
ornamented
with
carvings
of
ships
and
other
maritime
themes
Although
Blauwbrug
is
the
most
ornate
bridge
in
the
city
Amsterdammers
and
visitors
alike
still
have
soft
spot
for
its
neighbor
just
little
way
south
down
the
Amstel
Magere
Brug
or
âSkinny
Bridge.â
This
white-painted
wooden
drawbridge
is
picture-perfect
and
one
of
the
most
enduring
symbols
of
the
city
It
is
even
prettier
at
dusk
when
the
lights
on
its
arches
and
spars
are
switched
on
There
has
been
bridge
on
this
site
since
the
1670s
but
the
present
one
was
erected
as
recently
as
1969
Along
the
river
on
either
side
of
Magere
Brug
are
number
of
wonderful
barges
moored
on
the
banks
The
huge
craft
which
would
once
have
carried
heavy
cargoes
such
as
grain
and
coal
now
make
surprisingly
large
comfortable
quirky
and
very
expensive
homes
Beyond
Magere
Brug
on
the
left
bank
of
the
Amstel
you
will
see
the
faÃ§ade
of
Theater
CarrÃ©
Traditionally
the
site
of
the
CarrÃ©
Circus
the
CarrÃ©
family
built
wooden
structure
on
the
site
to
house
their
shows
Later
the
structure
was
deemed
to
be
fire
hazard
and
so
they
had
this
beautiful
stone
building
designed
for
them
which
opened
for
performances
in
1887
It
now
hosts
many
different
types
of
performance
but
circus
always
appears
here
at
Christmas
time
Cross
the
river
via
Magere
Brug
then
travel
one
block
north
and
take
left
along
the
northern
bank
of
the
Herengracht
Canal
Here
you
will
get
your
first
glimpse
of
the
canal
system
which
was
built
during
Amsterdamâs
Golden
Age
and
revolutionized
the
city
During
its
time
probably
the
most
sought
after
and
expensive
real
estate
in
the
world
Herengracht
particularly
has
many
beautiful
houses
which
can
really
only
be
appreciated
by
an
afternoon
strolling
by
them
(see
box
page
66)
This
part
of
town
is
still
mostly
residential
and
many
houses
have
been
converted
into
apartments
for
successful
Amsterdammers
It
is
fascinating
to
peek
inside
at
the
ultra-modern
interiors
which
give
feel
of
the
flair
the
Dutch
seem
to
have
for
interior
design
At
number
605
Herengracht
Museum
Willet-Holthuysen
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
look
behind
the
faÃ§ade
of
genuine
Golden
Age
house
It
was
completed
in
1690
and
structurally
has
been
altered
very
little
since
that
time
although
it
has
been
changed
cosmetically
several
times
as
fashions
changed
In
1855
it
came
into
the
possession
of
the
Holthuysen
family
Pieter
Holthuysen
was
successful
trader
in
glass
and
English
coal
(which
goes
to
prove
that
you
didnât
need
to
trade
in
exotic
goods
to
become
wealthy)
After
the
death
of
Pieter
and
his
wife
the
house
is
bequeathed
to
their
daughter
Louisa
who
later
married
Abraham
Willet
He
had
love
of
art
and
was
founding
member
of
the
Royal
Antiquarian
SocietyÂ âÂ a
society
whose
aim
was
to
promote
national
art
and
history
On
her
death
in
1895
Louisa
bequeathed
the
house
and
its
contents
to
the
city
of
Amsterdam
on
condition
that
it
would
be
opened
as
museum
This
it
duly
did
in
1896
You
will
be
able
to
examine
in
detail
the
furniture
porcelain
and
numerous
artworks
collected
by
the
family
Travel
further
along
Herengracht
to
the
end
of
the
second
block
Here
you
will
find
one
of
the
most
fascinating
views
of
the
canal
ring
From
the
bridge
it
is
possible
to
see
14
other
bridges
by
looking
up
and
down
Herengracht
and
ahead
down
the
adjoining
Reguliersgracht
(this
view
is
even
better
at
water
level
so
take
canal
cruiseÂ âÂ and
your
camera!)
Reguliersgracht
has
some
very
pretty
houses
and
is
quieter
than
the
main
three
âgirdleâ
canals
built
at
this
time
The
small
square
here
is
Thorbeckeplein
and
you
will
see
suitably
somber
statue
of
Johan
Rudolf
Thorbecke
who
designed
the
Dutch
constitution
in
1848
Wander
through
the
square
which
hosts
an
art
market
on
Sundays
to
reach
Rembrandtsplein
one
of
the
cityâs
most
vibrant
social
centers
Before
1878
this
square
was
called
Botermarkt
(a
butter
market
was
held
here
in
the
19th
century)
but
the
square
was
renamed
after
the
large
statue
of
Rembrandt
was
sited
here
One
wonders
what
he
would
have
made
of
the
square
for
since
the
statue
was
unveiled
it
has
attracted
theaters
cinemas
clubs
and
show
halls
along
with
plethora
of
bars
and
restaurants
and
curtain
of
vibrant
neon
signs
all
around
the
faÃ§ade
On
summer
evening
it
is
one
of
the
best
places
to
sit
with
drink
and
watch
the
world
go
by
and
is
within
easy
reach
of
romantic
walk
along
the
canalsides
Beyond
the
eastern
end
of
Waterlooplein
you
will
see
the
Visserplein
busy
with
several
lanes
of
traffic
Head
across
the
square
to
Weesperstraat
to
find
the
Joods
Historisch
Museum
(Jewish
Historical
Museum)
which
documents
the
history
of
the
once
large
and
influential
Jewish
community
in
the
city
Jewish
history
dates
back
to
the
late
16th
century
but
was
cut
short
by
the
Nazi
occupation
of
Amsterdam
in
1940
The
systematic
deportation
of
the
Jewish
population
to
concentration
camps
destroyed
the
community
and
after
the
war
only
handful
of
the
thousands
forced
to
leave
returned
to
their
homes
The
museum
which
opened
in
1987
was
created
by
the
amalgamation
of
four
old
Ashkanazi
synagogue
buildings
The
exhibitions
reveal
the
history
of
the
Amsterdam
Jews
but
also
explain
the
philosophies
of
Judaism
and
examine
Jewish
identity
in
broader
sense
Across
the
busy
road
of
Weesperstraat
are
two
other
reminders
of
the
once-thriving
Jewish
community
In
stark
exposed
position
near
the
road
in
Jonas
DaniÃ«l
Meijerplein
is
the
Dokwerker
Statue
by
Mari
Andriessen
This
figure
of
true
working
man
commemorates
the
day
in
February
1941
when
the
dock
workers
rose
up
in
protest
against
the
Nazi
deportation
of
the
Jews
Behind
the
statue
is
the
Portugese-IsraÃ«litische
Synagoge
(Portuguese
Synagogue)
which
was
inaugurated
in
1675
for
the
Spanish
and
Portuguese
Sephardic
Jews
who
settled
in
the
city
Its
design
is
said
to
be
based
on
that
of
King
Solomonâs
Temple
From
Jonas
DaniÃ«l
Meijerplein
look
southeast
to
the
glass
houses
of
the
Hortus
Botanicus
(Botanical
Gardens)
easily
seen
just
across
the
Nieuwe
Herengracht
canal
Cross
the
canal
by
walking
left
along
its
banks
to
the
nearby
bridge
Once
across
you
have
entered
the
Plantage
area
of
the
city
once
an
area
of
parkland
but
which
developed
from
the
mid-19th
century
into
one
of
the
first
city
suburbs
The
Botanical
Gardens
have
long
and
illustrious
history
They
began
as
small
medicinal
garden
in
1682
but
soon
became
the
depository
for
many
of
the
new
plant
species
brought
from
Dutch
colonies
in
the
Golden
Age
and
were
responsible
for
developing
each
genus
for
cultivation
propagation
and
commercial
exploitation
The
distinctive
glass
houses
were
added
in
1912
and
today
the
gardens
have
one
of
the
largest
collections
in
the
world
two-minute
walk
down
Plantage
Middenlaan
(Plantage
Middle
Road)
leads
you
to
Artis
fascinating
complex
of
zoo
aquarium
planetarium
and
Geological
Museum
which
aims
to
increase
your
knowledge
of
the
physical
world
The
zoo
was
one
of
the
first
in
Europe
when
it
opened
its
doors
in
1838
and
it
has
continued
as
groundbreaking
institution
now
acting
as
center
for
efforts
to
save
several
endangered
species
of
animals
Many
of
the
old
and
confined
Victorian
enclosures
where
the
animals
were
kept
have
been
redeveloped
in
the
1990s
to
create
more
fitting
environments
for
their
majestic
and
healthy-looking
animals
The
Planetarium
and
other
areas
of
Artis
offer
fun
ways
to
learn
about
the
world
around
us
and
are
entertaining
for
adults
and
children
alike
Southeast
of
Artis
across
two
canals
and
busy
roads
is
Oosterpark
an
open
green
area
with
lake
and
play
areas
(we
would
suggest
taking
tramÂ âÂ numbers
and
14Â âÂ rather
than
walking
here
from
the
city
center)
In
the
northern
corner
of
the
park
is
the
Tropenmuseum
once
the
home
of
the
Dutch
Colonial
Institute
The
building
itself
was
built
in
1926
and
built
especially
to
house
the
instituteâs
collection
of
artifacts
from
the
tropics.Today
the
aim
of
the
museum
is
to
improve
our
knowledge
of
the
worldâs
tropical
areas
and
promotes
an
understanding
of
the
peoples
in
these
developing
parts
of
the
world
vast
collection
of
artifacts
from
the
former
Dutch
East
Indies
(now
Indonesia)
was
the
starting
point
for
the
displays
which
range
from
tribal
masks
to
tools
and
utensils
in
daily
use
Recreations
of
Bombay
street
and
Arab
souk
among
other
locales
bring
home
the
reality
of

in
these
very
different
societies
The
museum
also
has
Kindermuseum
(Childrenâs
Museum)
offering
6â12
year
olds
chance
to
explore
the
collection
and
interact
with
the
exhibits
Special
guides
lead
children
through

North
of
Artis
is
Entrepotdok
In
the
19th
century
this
was
the
warehouse
region
of
the
city
and
its
carefully
designed
canals
were
one
of
the
busiest
port
areas
in
Europe
The
warehouses
fell
into
disrepair
in
the
20th
century
and
lay
empty
for
many
years
before
they
became
center
for
the
1960s
and
1970s
squatter
revolution
which
overtook
the
city
Since
the
1980s
the
area
has
been
totally
renovated
and
the
warehouses
gutted
to
create
modern
spacious
housing
offices
and
bars
and
restaurants
without
changing
the
basic
design
of
the
buildings
Some
inhabitants
get
birdâs
eye
view
of
Artis
zooÂ âÂ imagine
looking
out
of
your
apartment
window
on
rainy
Amsterdam
day
and
seeing
small

of
grazing
zebra
Walk
north
through
Entrepodok
and
you
will
reach
the
main
route
of
Prinse
Henrikkade
which
runs
along
the
northern
edge
of
the
city
(this
would
lead
you
back

Cross
the

of
the
Nieuwe

This
is
The
Scheepvaartmuseum
(The
National

Museum)
As
you
cross
the
bridge
look
left
for
glimpse
of
the
only
windmill
left
in
the
cityâs
central
area
The
De

windmill
was
built
in
the
early
part
of
the
18th
century
to
grind
corn
The

The
Scheepvaartmuseum
was
built
in
1656
for
the
Dutch
navy
Its
strong

vast
arsenal
used
to
protect
Dutch
interests
around

Today
its
extensive

document
the
long
and
illustrious
history
of
maritime
achievement
by
the
Dutch
with
paintings

that
shipsÂ âÂ and
particularly
the
VOCÂ âÂ played
in
the
growth
of
the
empire
in
the
17th
century
The
Dutch
Royal
barge
(last
used
in
1962)
is
also
kept
in
air-conditioned
splendor
but
perhaps
pride
of
placeÂ âÂ and
certainly
what
brings
18th-century
seafaring
to
lifeÂ âÂ is
the
re-creation

in
the
major
art
museums
of
the
city
Our
starting
point
is
Muntplein
at
the
junction
of
the
Amstel
and
the
Singel
canals
Although
only
small
square
and
cut
by
so
many
tramlines
that
it
is
difficult
to
know
which
way
to
look
it
has
very
beautiful
towerÂ âÂ Muntorren
(Mint
Tower)
Originally
medieval
gate
guarding
the
entrance
to
the
city
it
was
damaged
by
fire
in
1619
and
the
clock
tower
was
added
by
de
Keyser
during
the
renovations
of
1620
In
1699
the
carillon
was
installed
and
this
still
fills
the
air
with
its
regular
bell
rounds
During
the
war
with
France
in
1672
when
Amsterdam
had
its
supply
of
money
cut
off
the
tower
was
transformed
for
short
time
into
the
city
mint
and
the
name
has
remained
since
that
time
In
the
shadow
of
the
tower
and
floating
on
the
Singel
canal
(the
medieval
protective
moat
for
the
city)
is
the
Bloemenmarkt
(Flower
market)
The
daily
market
has
been
held
for
centuries
when
the
flower
sellers
would
arrive
by
canal
with
boats
laden
with
blooms
Today
the
stalls
still
float
on
the
water
but
are
permanently
attached
to
the
canal
wall
The
blooms
they
sell
bring
splash
of
color
to
even
the
dullest
Amsterdam
day
Stroll
along
the
market
until
you
reach
Konigsplein
and
take
left
down
Leidsestraat
This
is
major
shopping
street
and
one
of
the
busiest
because
it
links
one
of
the
largest
squares
in
the
city
to
the
central
area
Stop
at
Metz
and
Co
department
store
which
sits
on
the
corner
of
Keizersgracht
and
Leidsegracht
One
of
the
oldest
in
town
it
offers
good
views
of
the
city
from
the
cafÃ©
on
the
top
floor
At
the
end
of
Leidsestraat
is
Leidseplein
probably
the
busiest
in
the
city
and
major
focus
for
âR&Râ
in
the
city
The
bars
and
cafÃ©s
spill
out
onto
the
square
which
strangely
has
no
real
point
of
focus
unlike
Rembrandtsplein
Look
out
for
small
grassy
area
with
sculptures
of
life-size
iguanas
and
other
large
lizards
The
narrow
streets
leading
off
the
square
are
filled
with
cinemas
concert
halls
and
intimate
live
venues
There
is
also
busy
VVV
Amsterdam
Tourist
Office
In
summer
youâll
find
several
different
street
performers
vying
for
your
guilders
Itâs
place
where
talented
music
students
play
classical
pieces
or
musicians
from
around
the
world
play
their
traditional
tunes
In
winter
an
ice
rink
fills
the
space
so
you
can
enjoy
skating
session
Whatever
the
time
of
year
as
the
sun
sets
the
neon
lights
are
switched
on
and
people
flock
to
enjoy
the
restaurants
and
nightclubs
which
keeps
the
square
buzzing
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
On
the
western
side
of
Leidseplein
you
will
find
the
Stadsschouwburg
(Municipal
Theater)
which
was
built
in
1894
Once
the
premier
opera
house
in
the
city
it
has
been
usurped
by
the
Muziek
Theater
but
still
hosts
regular
performances
of
visiting
and
Dutch
companies
being
home
to
the
Toneelgroep
drama
group
Next
door
sits
the
American
Hotel
an
Art
Nouveau
treasure
and
national
monument
completed
in
1902
If
you
are
not
staying
at
the
hotel
be
sure
to
visit
the
CafÃ©
Americain
on
the
first
floor
to
enjoy
the
sumptuous
surroundings
and
perhaps
share
coffee
with
celebrity
or
two
Turn
left
once
through
Leidseplein
and
across
the
Singelgracht
canal
and
you
will
find
the
Amsterdam
Casino
and
Lido
on
your
left
On
your
right
across
Stadhouderskade
is
narrow
gate
leading
to
Vondelpark
This
park
founded
in
1865
has
been
called
âthe
lungs
of
Amsterdamâ
and
was
founded
after
number
of
philanthropic
city
fathers
decided
that
there
was
need
for
genteel
recreation
area
for
the
cityâs
population
many
of
whom
lived
in
overcrowded
slums
The
park
was
named
after
the
Netherlandsâ
premier
poet
Joost
van
den
Vondel
and
designed
in
the
English
fashion
of
the
times
Today
its
46
hectares
(120
acres)
have
grazing
farm
animals
flocks
of
parakeets
jogging
tracks
and
cycle
paths
It
is
the
perfect
place
for
picnic
on
summerâs
day
The
large
pavilion
which
opened
in
1881
was
restored
and
refurbished
in
1991
and
reopened
as
the
Nederlands
Filmmuseum
It
now
shows
more
than
1000
films
each
year
including
many
outdoor
screenings
and
other
artistic
performances
in
the
summer
Only
five
minutes
to
the
south
of
Leidseplein
is
the
museum
quarter
for
many
visitors
the
raison
dâÃªtre
for
their
visit
to
Amsterdam
Here
three
of
the
most
important
art
collections
in
Europe
sit
side
by
side
allowing
visitors
to
walk
from
one
to
the
next
in
matter
of
moments
Although
all
very
different
in
appearance
they
are
brought
together
by
an
open
space
which
has
recently
been
redesigned
and
replanted
to
accent
the
buildings
The
square
is
called
not
surprisingly
Museumplein
The
Rijksmuseum
Pride
of
place
must
go
to
the
Rijksmuseum
(The
National
Art
Gallery)
with
arguably
the
greatest
collection
of
Dutch
art
in
the
world
The
collection
is
housed
in
magnificent
Victorian
Gothic
building
especially
designed
for
it
by
P
J
H
Cuypers
which
was
opened
in
1885
The
museum
can
be
confusing
maze
of
connecting
roomsÂ âÂ additions
were
completed
in
1898
and
1919Â âÂ so
it
pays
to
sit
down
for
few
minutes
to
study
the
very
comprehensive
map
which
accompanies
your
ticket
multimedia
interactive
study
area
also
allows
you
to
review
the
vast
collection
on
screen
pinpoint
works
which
you
want
to
see
and
print
out
further
details
of
each
piece
The
center
called
ARIA
(Amsterdam
Rijksmuseum
InterActief)
is
located
in
room
225
behind
the
Night
Watch
room
You
can
also
take
advantage
of
an
audio
CD
tour
to
give
you
background
detail
as
you
explore
The
collection
is
varied
but
most
visitors
come
to
see
the
works
of
the
Dutch
masters
Dutch
painting
of
the
15th
to
17th
centuries
are
to
be
found
in
rooms
201
to
236
on
the
second
floor
Among
the
collection
are
20
works
by
Rembrandt
including
The
Nightwatch
properly
entitled
The
Company
of
Captain
Frans
Banning
Cocq
and
Lieutenant
Willem
van
Ruytenburch
The
work
which
was
commissioned
by
the
company
for
its
barracks
is
remarkable
for
its
lack
of
formality
and
very
different
from
the
accepted
style
of
the
day
Johannes
Vermeer
(1632â1675)
is
also
well-represented
and
his
effective
use
of
light
can
be
clearly
seen
in
The
Kitchen
Maid
painted
in
1660
which
is
one
of
the
galleryâs
best-loved
pieces
There
are
paintings
by
Frans
Hals
the
founding
artist
of
The
Dutch
School
along
with
collection
of
Dutch
artists
influenced
or
schooled
by
the
masters
Rembrandt
was
prolific
teacher
and
his
pupils
produced
work
so
similar
to
his
that
in
later
years
many
were
initially
mistaken
for
the
great
artistâs
work
Look
out
also
for
painting
A17
by
lesser-known
artist
Gerrit
Adriaensz
Berckheyde
which
depicts
Herengracht
in
1672
when
its
grand
houses
were
just
being
completed
The
view
has
no
trees
and
shows
the
âGentlemanâs
Canalâ
in
pristine
condition
Works
of
later
Dutch
artists
include
number
by
artists
of
The
Hague
School
which
rose
to
fame
in
the
late
1800s
and
whose
best-known
representative
is
Jan
van
Huysum
The
museum
also
has
collection
of
work
by
non-Dutch
artists
including
Rubens
Tintoretto
and
El
Greco
and
impressive
displays
of
porcelain
furniture
sculpture
and
decorative
arts
including
large
section
of
Asiatic
art
in
the
South
Wing
It
also
has
restaurant
for
those
who
feel
the
need
to
take
break
in
the
middle
of
their
tour
The
Van
Gogh
Museum
Behind
the
ornate
Gothic
Rijksmuseum
are
the
ultra-modern
lines
of
the
Van
Gogh
Museum
devoted
to
the
work
of
this
modern
Dutch
master
The
main
building
was
designed
by
Gerrit
Reitveld
and
opened
in
1973
however
large
freestanding
wing
of
circular
design
by
Kisho
Kurokawa
was
completed
in
1999
to
host
temporary
exhibitions
The
museum
houses
over
200
paintings
and
500
drawings
by
the
artistÂ âÂ one
of
the
most
infamous
of
the
19th
centuryÂ âÂ and
it
constitutes
the
greatest
collection
of
his
work
covering
all
periods
of
his
troubled
career
The
bulk
of
the
collection
was
brought
together
by
Theo
Van
Gogh
who
also
kept
over
800
letters
written
by
his
brother
which
when
read
in
conjunction
with
viewing
the
paintings
bring
life
and
context
to
the
works
themselves
Vincentâs
working
life
was
short
but
frenetic
interspersed
with
periods
of
manic
depression
and
his
paintings
reflect
his
moods
His
1885
work
The
Potato
Eaters
shows
the
hard
lives
endured
by
the
rural
poor
among
whom
Van
Gogh
lived
at
this
time
Contrast
this
with
the
superb
vibrant
colors
of
The
Bedroom
in
Arles
and
Vase
with
Sunflowers
both
painted
after
Vincent
moved
to
Provence
in
1888
Van
Gogh
is
renowned
for
his
reinterpretation
of
the
works
of
other
artists
and
the
museum
has
prime
examples
of
works
based
on
paintings
by
Rembrandt
Delacroix
and
Millet
The
Stedelijk
Museum
Next
door
to
the
Van
Gogh
Museum
is
another
whose
stately
exterior
presents
very
different
impression
to
its
contents
The
building
of
the
Stedelijk
Museum
was
finished
in
1895
The
faÃ§ade
is
neolassical
with
figures
of
famous
Dutch
men
such
as
the
architect
de
Keyser
gaze
down
on
the
passing
crowds
It
was
built
specifically
to
house
the
private
art
collection
of
Sophia
de
Bruyn
who
then
bequeathed
it
to
the
city
in
1890
In
1938
it
became
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art
and
today
it
displays
permanent
range
of
work
by
celebrated
artists
and
numerous
temporary
exhibitions
which
reflect
the
cutting
edge
in
visual
art
genres
such
as
photography
and
video
Look
particularly
for
works
by
Marc
Chagall
including
his
self
portrait
Portrait
of
the
Artist
with
Seven
Fingers
Pregnant
Woman
and
Man
with
Violin
Picasso
is
represented
by
several
works
along
with
paintings
by
Monet
CÃ©zanne
and
Matisse
There
is
also
comprehensive
examination
of
the
De
Stijl
(The
Style)
art
and
design
movement
which
swept
through
the
Netherlands
in
the
post-WWI
period
Gerrit
Reitveld
designer
of
the
Van
Gogh
Museum
has
several
designs
in
the
collection
and
the
work
of
Piet
Mondrian
the
Dutch
modernist
are
some
of
the
most
popular
in
the
museum
If
you
feel
exhausted
after
your
âmuseum-fest,â
then
the
streets
around
the
Museumplein
offer
some
exciting
retail
therapy
Walk
across
Paulus
Potterstraat
from
the
Van
Gogh
Museum
and
you
will
find
Coster
Diamonds
one
of
the
oldest
âhousesâ
in
the
city
where
you
can
watch
diamonds
being
polished
and
maybe
buy
carat
or
two
Van
Baerlstraat
bordering
the
west
side
of
Museumplein
is
the
haute
couture
area
of
the
city
For
further
culture
of
musical
nature
the
Concertgebouw
on
Van
Bearlstraat
is
home
to
the
orchestra
of
the
same
name
The
main
auditorium
is
considered
to
have
almost
perfect
acoustics
even
though
the
designer
of
the
building
Van
Gendt
had
no
experience
in
this
specialized
area
If
you
want
to
stroll
back
to
town
after
your
visit
to
the
museums
then
walk
through
the
open
courtyard
which
cuts
through
the
center
of
the
Rijksmuseum
across
Stadouderskade
and
on
to
the
narrow
street
of
Nieuwe
Speigalstraat
This
center
of
antique
and
art
galleries
has
some
wonderful
windows
to
gaze
into
Prices
are
said
to
be
on
the
high
side
but
the
dealers
are
some
of
the
most
experienced
in
the
world
and
they
are
sure
to
give
you
good
advice
Walk
north
along
the
whole
length
of
Nieuwe
Speigalstraat
and
you
will
eventually
reach
Herengracht
at
its
most
spectacular
point
When
it
was
first
dug
and
the
lots
of
land
sold
it
was
soon
realized
that
this
section
of
the
canal
(between
Vijzelstraat
and
Leidsestraat)
would
have
the
largest
houses
inhabited
by
the
richest
families
in
the
city
For
this
reason
it
has
become
known
as
the
âGolden
Bend.â
Many
of
these
buildings
now
house
banks
and
financial
institutions
Northwest
The
northwest
section
abuts
the
center
commencing
at
Kalverstraat
the
rather
brash
âhappeningâ
shopping
street
which
cuts
the
center
of
Amsterdam
from
north
to
south
When
you
reach
Spui
take
left
into
small
squareÂ âÂ on
Fridays
you
will
find
book
market
here
On
the
north
side
of
the
square
you
will
see
small
alleyway
which
seems
to
lead
between
two
houses
This
is
the
entrance
to
the
Begijnhof
haven
of
peace
in
the
center
of
the
city
The
cluster
of
buildings
around
small
central
square
was
set
aside
in
1346
for
the
benefit
of
Beguines
members
of
lay
Catholic
sisterhood
They
lived
simple
lives
and
in
return
for
their
lodgings
undertook
to
care
for
the
sick
and
educate
the
poor
Although
nothing
remains
of
the
14th-century
houses
number
34
is
Het
Houten
Huis
Amsterdamâs
oldest
house
dating
from
1488
The
Catholic
chapel
dates
from
1680
when
it
was
built
in
style
to
disguise
its
purpose
The
stained
glass
windows
depict
the
Miracle
of
Amsterdam
However
in
the
center
of
the
courtyard
is
an
earlier
church
now
called
the
English
Presbyterian
Church
It
was
rented
out
to
English
and
Scottish
worshippers
in
1607
following
the
Alteration
and
the
Pilgrim
Fathers
worshipped
here
before
they
set
off
on
their
long
journey
to
the
New
World
(they
came
to
Amsterdam
from
England
before
they
set
sail
for
the
New
World)
The
last
Beguine
died
as
recently
as
1971
and
today
although
the
houses
are
still
offered
only
to
single
women
of
the
Christian
faith
the
women
are
not
expected
to
undertake
lay
work
Behind
the
Begijnhof
is
the
old
Convent
of
St
Lucian
which
became
the
city
orphanage
after
the
Alteration
although
it
was
only
open
to
well-to-do
orphans;
the
poor
had
to
fend
for
themselves
Extended
several
times
including
wing
designed
by
de
Keyser
it
was
opened
as
the
Amsterdam
Historical
Museum
in
1975
and
its
rooms
reveal
the
details
of
the
development
of
this
fascinating
city
Youâll
see
plans
maps
and
paintings
depicting
the
streets
and
canals
as
they
were
when
just
completed
The
Golden
Age
is
brought
to
life
(rooms
5â15)
but
there
is
also
an
interesting
section
on
20th-century
Amsterdam
the
Nazi
occupation
and
efforts
to
protect
and
preserve
the
city
Tiny
details
such
as
the
relief
above
the
Kalverstraat
entrance
which
asks
people
to
support
the
upkeep
of
the
orphanage
also
point
to
the
museumâs
original
purpose
Once
out
of
the
museum
walk
north
Take
Kalverstraat
or
if
you
find
it
little
too
busy
for
comfort
take
Rokin
which
runs
parallel
to
Kalverstraat
to
the
right
This
wide
street
was
once
also
canal
which
was
drained
and
filled
in
to
allow
better
access
for
modern
forms
of
transport
On
the
far
side
of
the
canal
you
will
see
the
elegant
Georgian
faÃ§ade
of
the
Allard
Pierson
Museum
the
archaeological
collection
for
the
city
Another
couple
of
minutes
strolling
will
bring
you
to
Dam
Square
(simply
called
Dam
by
Amsterdammers)
the
symbolic
heart
of
the
city
Dam
is
wide
cobbled
square
usually
filled
with
people
and
pigeons
and
dominated
by
the
ornate
faÃ§ade
of
the
Koninklijk
Paleis
(Royal
Palace)
which
dates
from
1655
It
was
originally
built
as
the
Town
Hall
facing
the
landing
wharfs
of
the
Damrak
which
would
at
that
time
have
been
busy
with
ships
The
classical
design
by
Jacob
van
Campen
gives
some
indication
of
the
confidence
of
the
city
in
the
Golden
AgeÂ âÂ a
statue
of
Atlas
carrying
the
world
on
his
shoulders
sits
astride
the
rear
of
the
building
and
in
the
sumptuous
interior
only
the
best
materials
were
used
When
Louis
Bonaparte
brother
of
Napoleon
became
King
of
Holland
in
1806
he
demanded
palace
suitable
for
his
position
and
requisitioned
the
Town
Hall
He
furnished
it
with
the
finest
pieces
of
the
time
and
left
them
all
behind
only
four
years
later
when
he
was
forced
out
of
power
It
has
remained
Royal
Palace
ever
since
but
it
is
not
royal
residence
la
Buckingham
Palace
in
London
and
is
only
used
for
ceremonial
occasions
It
is
possible
to
visit
the
palace
in
summer
if
there
are
no
official
activities
taking
place
Beside
the
Palace
sits
Nieuwe
Kerk
(New
Church)
built
before
the
Royal
Palace
but
not
the
oldest
church
in
the
city
hence
its
name
The
church
has
suffered
several
catastrophic
fires
during
its
history
and
was
stripped
of
all
its
treasures
during
the
Alteration
The
pulpit
is
interesting
since
it
is
beautiful
but
extremely
ornate
for
Protestant
place
of
worship
Across
Dam
Square
is
the
stark
white
National
Monument
paid
for
by
public
subscription
after
WWII
and
erected
in
1956
It
commemorates
the
role
of
the
Dutch
nation
in
the
war
On
Damâs
south
side
you
will
find
Madame
Tussauds
branch
of
the
London
waxworks
Not
only
will
you
be
able
to
see
figures
of
your
favorite
music
and
film
stars
here
along
with
whole
panorama
which
recreates
Amsterdamâs
Golden
Age
but
also
the
windows
on
the
upper
floors
give
excellent
views
over
the
square
Make
your
way
behind
the
Royal
Palace
to
Raadhuisstraat
which
will
lead
to
the
northern
canal
ring
(Heren
Keizers
and
Prinsen
grachts)
Immediately
behind
the
palace
is
Magna
Plaza
originally
the
main
Post
Office
building
built
in
1899
in
an
almost
exaggerated
Gothic
style
It
was
considered
far
too
ornate
for
civil
service
when
it
was
originally
opened
but
was
refurbishedÂ âÂ and
the
interior
sympathetically
adaptedÂ âÂ in
1990
to
house
the
cityâs
only
shopping
mall
Raadhuisstaat
is
the
main
thoroughfare
to
the
northwestern
canal
ring
and
is
busy
with
trams
buses
and
cars
It
will
take
you
quickly
to
the
main
attractions
of
the
area
but
it
is
not
the
prettiest
or
quietest
route
Wandering
the
smaller
alleys
and
lanes
to
the
north
and
south
of
it
will
be
much
more
fulfilling
(the
details
of
the
highlights
of
each
of
the
major
canals
can
be
seen
on
page

Follow
Raadhuisstraat
until
you
reach
the
Westerkerk
set
in
its
own
square
on
the
left
and
overlooking
Prinsengracht
This
church
was
designed
by
de
Keyser
in
1619
and
was
one
of
his
last
commissions
It
is
said
to
be
the
burial
place
of
Rembrandt
but
unfortunately
no
one
knows
knows
the
exact
location
One
of
his
pupils
Gerard
de
Lairesse
painted
the
organ
panels
which
were
added
in
1686
In
summer
you
can
climb
the
tower
the
tallest
in
the
city
at
83m
(273
ft)
for
incomparable
views
of
the
surrounding
rooftops
The
crown
on
top
of
the
bell
tower
is
replica
of
the
crown
presented
to
the
city
in
1489
by
Maximilian
I
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Turn
left
beyond
the
church
to
Prinsengracht
263
just
an
ordinary
canal
house-cum-office
but
made
famous
worldwide
by
what
happened
here
in
WWII
This
is
Anne
Frank
Huis
(Anne
Frank
House)
where
during
the
Nazi
occupation
of
Amsterdam
this
young
girl
her
family
and
small
group
of
others
hid
for
two
years
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
capture
and
deportation
Anne
wrote
diary
which
paints
clear
and
terrifying
picture
of
the
life
the
family
lived
It
comes
to
an
eerie
stop
only
few
days
before
the
family
was
discovered
and
sent
to
concentration
camps
Of
the
eight
people
in
hiding
only
Anneâs
father
survivedÂ âÂ Anne
died
of
typhus
only
weeks
before
the
war
endedÂ âÂ and
after
the
war
in
1947
he
published
the
diary
It
became
not
only
an
international
bestseller
but
also
symbol
for
the
oppression
of
humankind
The
house
built
in
1635
has
been
left
much
as
it
was
at
the
time
that
Anne
hid
here
It
opened
as
museum
in
1960
The
secret
rooms
upstairs
where
the
family
spent
the
daylight
hours
are
stark
and
bleak
couple
of
magazine
pin-ups
still
adorn
one
wall
The
wooden
bookcase
which
hid
the
doorway
to
their
refuge
is
still
in
situ
propped
open
for
visitors
to
climb
the
few
stairs
to
their
home
Downstairs
were
the
offices
and
warehouses
of
Mr
Frankâs
business
which
have
been
recreated
in
multimillion
dollar
development
opened
in
September
1999
Two
adjacent
buildings
have
been
bought
by
the
museum
and
refurbished
adding
much-needed
exhibition
and
audio-visual
space
without
compromising
number

Youâll
see
videos
of
Anneâs
story
and
of
Amsterdam
under
occupation
along
with
photographs
and
artifacts
of
the
time
Anne
Frank
Huis
also
acts
as
an
education
center
and
resource
for
political
and
philosophical
groups
fighting
oppression
in
the
present
day
Cross
Prinsengracht
to
reach
the
area
of
the
city
known
as
the
Jordaan
Built
as
housing
for
workers
and
artisans
in
the
early
17th
century
it
extends
roughly
from
the
far
bank
of
Prinsengracht
to
Lijnbaansgracht
and
from
Brouwersgracht
(Brewers
Canal)
in
the
north
down
to
Leidseplein
Many
of
the
streets
were
named
after
fragrant
flowers
but
this
was
not
the
prettiest
or
sweetest
smelling
area
of
Amsterdam
in
its
heyday
Overcrowding
was
rife
and
with
industries
such
as
fabric-dyeing
carried
out
on
the
ground
floors
it
was
an
unsanitary
place
to
live
Its
name
is
said
to
derive
from
the
French
word
jardin
since
large
contingent
of
French
Huguenots
came
to
live
here
to
escape
political
persecution
in
their
homeland
Today
the
Jordaan
has
been
revived
and
it
has
become
fashionable
residential
area
Youâll
find
many
bars
restaurants
and
interesting
boutiques
in
the
area
Itâs
good
place
to
browse
for
an
unusual
souvenir
of
your
trip
The
outskirts
of
Amsterdam
Amsterdam
is
large
city
despite
its
small
center
and
the
sprawling
suburbs
hold
some
attractions
which
you
may
find
interesting
Aviodome
(take
the
train
to
Schiphol
Airport)
Aviodome
is
the
National
Aeronautical
Museum
and
is
housed
in
giant
aluminium
dome
in
the
grounds
of
Schiphol
Airport
It
leads
the
visitor
through
the
history
of
flight
from
the
Montgolfier
Brothers
and
their
balloons
to
the
space
race
Perhaps
the
most
important
part
of
the
museum
relates
the
history
of
KLM
the
national
airline
of
the
Netherlands
which
is
one
of
the
oldest
airline
companies
in
the
world
Amsterdam
Bos
(Bus
numbers
170

The
Netherlands
suffered
economic
stagnation
during
the
late
1920s
and
1930s
as
did
most
other
developed
countries
One
of
the
methods
used
to
relieve
the
problems
of
unemployment
was
to
organize
large
community
projects
which
were
funded
by
the
government
One
of
these
was
Amsterdam
Bos
or
Amsterdam
Wood
which
created
the
largest
recreation
area
in
the
city
In
1967
it
was
enlarged
to
its
present
800
hectares
(2,000
acres)
Amsterdam
Bos
is
more
than
park
It
has
meadows
woodland
and
huge
lake
for
rowing
sailing
and
hourly
row-boat
hire
It
features
nature
reserves
animal
enclosures
and
botanical
garden
There
is
also
an
open-air
theater
which
holds
performances
in
the
summer
Zaanse
Schans
Zaanse
Schans
is
the
archetypal
Dutch
landscape
personified
and
lies
just
few
miles
north
of
Amsterdam
center
in
the
suburb
of
Zaadam
This
landscape
is
no
accident
or
happy
coincidence
but
living
museum
created
in
1960
which
has
brought
together
number
of
farmhouses
windmills
dairies
and
barnsÂ âÂ real
agricultural
buildings
which
would
have
been
demolished
had
they
not
been
relocated
here
Zaanse
Schans
has
working
mills
cheese-making
factories
and
clog
workshops
situated
on
canalside
You
are
free
to
explore
at
your
own
pace
and
maybe
enjoy
pannekoeken
(pancake)
while
youâre
there
Excursions
tour
of
the
villages
north
of
Amsterdam
Although
Amsterdam
is
city
of
750,000
people
ten-minute
journey
can
transport
you
out
into
the
countryside
with
fields
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
You
donât
need
car
to
visit
and
explore
the
pretty
towns;
public
buses
provide
very
comprehensive
easy
and
cheap
service
To
the
north
of
Amsterdam
are
several
small
towns
which
not
only
provide
contrast
to
the
city
landscape
but
also
take
you
to
the
heart
of
agricultural
North
Holland
The
landscape
is
flat
and
cut
with
dikes
and
narrow
drainage
canals
Cows
and
sheep
can
be
seen
grazing
numerous
wading
birds
such
as
herons
keep
watchful
eye
on
the
water
and
every
few
hundred
yards
is
farmhouse
complete
with
several
single-story
barns
Broek
in
Waterland
is
the
first
settlement
reached
once
outside
the
city
environs
small
collection
of
quaint
wooden
houses
it
is
surrounded
by
canals
and
natural
streams
Further
north
is
Monnickendam
once
large
fishing
port
on
the
Zuider
Zee
which
lost
its
raison
dâÃªtre
when
the
Afsluitdijk
was
completed
in
1932
The
pretty
gabled
buildings
which
line
the
main
street
were
once
cottages
for
fisherfolk
and
the
small
port
still
plays
host
to
fleet
of
ships
Many
are
now
in
private
hands
or
work
as
pleasure
boats
in
the
summer
season
There
is
also
large
private
marina
filled
with
sailboats
which
head
out
on
to
the
open
water
on
any
sunny
weekend
Walk
around
the
old
port
to
find
vestiges
of
the
traditional
lifestyle
few
families
still
fish
for
eels
and
process
them
in
small
âfactoriesâ
along
the
quayside
In
summer
you
can
buy
the
catch
of
the
day
from
stalls
in
the
town
There
are
also
some
good
fish
restaurants
around
the
harbor
Just
km
(2.75
miles)
beyond
Monnickendam
is
the
community
of
Marken
one
of
the
most
beautiful
villages
in
the
Netherlands
and
home
to
community
of
Calvinist
Dutch
whose
traditions
reach
back
hundreds
of
years
The
older
inhabitants
of
this
close-knit
community
still
wear
traditional
Dutch
costume
as
everyday
wear
Until
1957
the
village
was
situated
on
an
island
remote
from
the
outside
world
The
opening
of
roadway
linking
the
village
to
the
mainland
brought
many
changes
for
the
inhabitants
Today
Marken
welcomes
visitors
but
not
their
cars
which
must
be
left
in
large
car
park
on
the
outskirts
You
can
walk
through
the
village
with
its
traditional
painted
wooden
houses
to
the
picture-perfect
port
Stop
at
the
tiny
museum
on
the
quayside
which
holds
an
eclectic
mix
of
seafaring
and
fishing
memorabilia
Traveling
from
Monnickendam
to
Marken
the
road
leads
out
into
open
water
home
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
birds
in
the
summer
The
native
herons
ducks
and
moorhens
see
many
species
of
migratory
birds
who
fly
north
for
the
summer
and
return
south
as
winter
approaches
The
road
also
makes
for
good
cycling
being
flat
and
smooth
or
for
walking
Head
out
towards
the
old
lighthouse
which
sits
surrounded
by
water
on
lonely
promontory
North
of
Marken
and
Monnickendam
is
Volendam
Catholic
counterpart
to
the
Protestant
Marken
It
is
perhaps
the
village
most
changed
by
tourism
with
cafÃ©s
and
souvenir
shops
lining
the
harbor
Our
tour
finishes
at
the
town
of
Edam
famed
for
its
cheese
with
pretty
kaaswaag
(Cheese
Weigh
House)
dating
from
1592
Look
out
for
the
wonderfully
named
KwakelbrugÂ âÂ the
narrowest
old
bridge
in
town
which
allows
only
single-file
foot
traffic
to
cross
The
center
of
town
has
an
unusual
paved
overlock
the
Damsluis
just
below
the
Captainâs
House
dating
from
1540
Despite
its
worldwide
renown
Edam
is
still
unspoiled
and
there
are
some
pretty
restaurants
where
you
can
enjoy
lunch
before
heading
back
to
the
city
Haarlem
and
the
Keukenhof
bulb
fields
Haarlem
situated
only
19
km
(12
miles)
from
Amsterdam
is
the
birthplace
of
Frans
Hals
father
of
The
Dutch
School
of
painting
which
developed
during
the
Golden
Age
He
was
peer
of
Rembrandtâs
among
others
The
center
of
town
is
maze
of
narrow
streets
filled
with
historic
buildings
all
of
which
fall
under
the
shadow
of
the
15th-century
St
Bavokerk
an
enormous
Gothic
edifice
which
boasts
one
of
the
finest
organs
in
Europe
installed
in
1735
Mozart
and
Handel
are
both
said
to
have
played
the
instrument
and
you
can
hear
it
for
yourself
on
Thursday
afternoons
in
summer
when
recitals
fill
the
church
with
music
Across
Lepelstraat
from
the
church
is
the
Frans
Hals
Museum
suitable
testimony
to
the
townâs
most
famous
son
who
was
still
happily
painting
in
his
eighties
The
museum
was
opened
in
1913
at
the
site
of
an
old
menâs
home
and
the
Vleeshal
(meat
market)
dating
from
1603
both
of
which
had
been
painted
by
Hals
during
his
lifetime
On
the
banks
of
the
River
Spaarne
is
Teylers
Museum
founded
by
silk
merchant
Pieter
Teyler
van
der
Hulst
in
1778
and
said
to
be
Hollandâs
oldest
public
collection
Teyler
having
no
heir
bequeathed
his
fortune
to
the
advancement
of
the
arts
and
sciences
and
there
is
an
interesting
collection
of
scientific
instruments
among
other
artifacts
The
museum
has
collections
ranging
from
minerals
and
fossils
to
medals
and
coins
Every
spring
from
mid-April
to
the
end
of
May
the
fields
between
Haarlem
and
Amsterdam
erupt
in
rainbow
of
color
which
stretches
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
The
celebrated
Dutch
tulips
flower
in
unison
creating
carpet
as
amazing
as
Josephâs
Biblical
coat
and
they
attract
thousands
of
visitors
for
these
few
weeks
of
beauty
Near
the
town
of
Lisse
are
the
celebrated
Keukenhof
Gardens
28-hectare
(69-acre)
showpiece
flower
garden
which
opens
its
doors
to
the
public
Youâll
find
crocus
hyacinth
and
narcissus
blooms
along
with
the
tulip
in
colors
you
normally
only
see
in
your
imagination
The
landscape
at
Keukenhof
is
enhanced
by
pretty
windmills
adding
to
the
authentic
Dutch
feel
There
is
also
restaurant
and
gift
shop
where
you
can
buy
bulbs
blooms
and
other
Dutch
souvenirs
Nearby
you
can
visit
the
Bloemenveiling
or
flower
auction
hall
at
Legmeerdijk
Every
day
it
auctions
millions
of
blooms
which
disappear
out
of
the
auction
room
to
be
dispatched
around
the
world
within
hours
Itâs
fascinating
to
watch
the
action
(or
lack
of
it)
as
miniature
trains
carry
the
flowers
through
the
auction
hall
for
the
buyers
to
assess
large
electronic
bid-taker
on
the
wall
reflects
the
current
bidding
price;
this
happens
several
times
every
minute
The
sheer
size
of
the
auction
house
is
what
gives
pause
for
thoughtÂ âÂ the
walkway
for
spectators
is
1.6
km
(1
mile)
long
Alkmaar
and
the
cheese
market
Dutch
cheeses
are
world
renowned
and
the
small
red
and
yellow
Edam
and
Gouda
rounds
can
be
found
in
supermarkets
and
grocery
stores
in
just
about
every
country
of
the
western
world
However
in
Holland
cheese
isnât
so
much
an
industry
as
way
of
life
and
tradition
still
has
part
to
play
in
the
production
and
distribution
of
the
product
Alkmaar
is
small
town
40
km
(25
miles)
from
Amsterdam
but
easily
reached
by
train
or
car
It
has
been
the
center
of
cheese
production
for
many
centuries
and
is
now
the
only
town
which
continues
with
cheese
market
every
Friday
morning
during
the
summer
The
large
square
in
front
of
the
14th-century
Waaggebouw
or
weigh
house
becomes
showcase
of
cheese
Rounds
of
cheese
are
piled
there
ready
to
be
taken
off
on
wooden
sleds
to
be
weighed
Uniformed
teams
of
porters
transport
the
sleds
on
shoulder
harnesses
and
each
team
playfully
attempts
to
be
faster
than
their
rivals
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
large
crowd
The
town
enjoys
busy
market
for
other
produce
on
âcheeseâ
Fridays
The
Waaggebouw
contains
the
Hollandse
Kaasmuseum
or
Holland
Cheese
museum
which

the

of
Floris
V
who
granted
Amsterdam
its
rights

toll
free
in
the
13th
century
In
sense
he
started
the

of
the

to
be
its

Brief
History
Centuries
before
the
arrival
of
Columbus
peaceful
Amerindian
people
who
called
themselves
the
Luccucairi
had
settled
in
the
Bahamas
Originally
from
South
America
they
had
traveled
up
through
the
Caribbean
islands
surviving
by
cultivating
modest
crops
and
from
what
they
caught
from
sea
and
shore
Nothing
in
the
experience
of
these
gentle
people
could
have
prepared
them
for
the
arrival
of
the
Pinta
the
NiÃ±a
and
the
Santa
Maria
at
San
Salvador
on
12
October
1492
Columbus
believed
that
he
had
reached
the
East
Indies
and
mistakenly
called
these
people
Indians
We
know
them
today
as
the
Lucayans
Columbus
claimed
the
island
and
others
in
the
Bahamas
for
his
royal
Spanish
patrons
but
not
finding
the
gold
and
other
riches
he
was
seeking
he
stayed
for
only
two
weeks
before
sailing
towards
Cuba
The
Spaniards
never
bothered
to
settle
in
the
Bahamas
but
the
number
of
shipwrecks
attest
that
their
galleons
frequently
passed
through
the
archipelago
en
route
to
and
from
the
Caribbean
Florida
Bermuda
and
their
home
ports
On
Eleuthera
the
explorers
dug
fresh-water
wellÂ âÂ at
spot
now
known
as
âSpanish
WellsâÂ âÂ which
was
used
to
replenish
the
supplies
of
water
on
their
ships
before
they
began
the
long
journey
back
to
Europe
with
their
cargoes
of
South
American
gold
As
for
the
Lucayans
within
25
years
all
of
them
perhaps
some
30,000
people
were
removed
from
the
Bahamas
to
workÂ âÂ and
dieÂ âÂ in
Spanish
gold
mines
and
on
farms
and
pearl
fisheries
on
Hispaniola
(Haiti)
Cuba
and
elsewhere
in
the
Caribbean
English
sea
captains
also
came
to
know
the
beautiful
but
deserted
Bahamian
islands
during
the
17th
century
Englandâs
first
formal
move
was
on
30
October
1629
when
Charles
granted
the
Bahamas
and
chunk
of
the
American
south
to
his
Attorney
General
Sir
Robert
Health
But
nothing
came
of
that
nor
of
rival
French
move
in
1633
when
Cardinal
Richelieu
the
17th-century
French
statesman
tried
claiming
the
islands
for
France
Colonization
and
Piracy
In
1648
group
of
English
Puritans
from
Bermuda
led
by
William
Sayle
sailed
to
Bahamian
waters
and
established
the
first
permanent
European
settlement
on
the
island
they
named
Eleutheria
(now
Eleuthera)
after
the
Greek
word
for
freedom
The
70
colonists
called
themselves
the
Eleutherian
Adventurers
but
life
was
very
difficult
and
the
colony
never
flourished
though
Sayle
was
long
honored
for
the
effort
In
1666
smaller
island
(called
Sayleâs
island)
with
fine
harbor
was
settled
by
Bermudians
and
renamed
New
Providence
It
was
later
to
become
known
as
Nassau
capital
of
the
Bahamas
In
1670
six
Lords
Proprietors
of
Carolina
were
granted
the
Bahama
islands
by
Charles
II
but
for
nearly
50
years
their
weak
governors
on
New
Providence
either
couldnât
or
wouldnât
suppress
the
piracy
raging
through
the
archipelago
Then
in
1684
to
avenge
countless
raids
against
their
ships
the
Spanish
dispatched
powerful
squadron
from
Cuba
to
attack
Nassau
This
sent
the
majority
of
the
English
settlers
fleeing
to
Jamaica
or
Massachusetts
but
didnât
have
much
effect
on
the
pirates
Most
feared
of
the
1,000
or
more
swashbucklers
operating
from
the
New
Providence
lair
was
Edward
Teach
better
known
as
Blackbeard
Today

tower
east
of
Nassau
named
after
him
Another
two
infamous
pirates
were
women:
Anne
Bonney
and
Mary
Read
had
exceptionally
bloodthirsty
reputations
and
are
still
celebrated
in
the
Bahamas
The
pirates
raided
anything
on
the
sea
living
totally
lawlessÂ âÂ and
often
not
very
lengthyÂ âÂ lives
Moreover
there
was
not
always
clear
distinction
between
pirates
and
privateers
the
latter
officially
authorized
by
their
governments
to
plunder
enemy
ships
during
time
of
war
Anarchy
and
confusion
reigned
throughout
the
area
In
1718
shortly
after
the
Bahamas
became
crown
colony
Captain
Woodes
Rogers
renowned
ex-privateer
was
named
the
first
royal
governor
Arriving
in
Nassau
with
powerful
force
and
promising
amnesty
for
surrender
he
became
legend
by
cleaning
out
many
of
the
pirates
and
establishing
some
order
This
incident
inspired
the
national
motto
Expulsis
PiratisÂ âÂ Restituta
Commercia
(Pirates
ExpelledÂ âÂ Commerce
Restored)
which
was
retained
until
1971
few
years
later
Rogers
quit
the
islands
only
to
return
for
second
time
in
1729
after
period
of
bankruptcy
and
debtorâs
prison
in
England
Before
he
died
in
Nassau
in
1732
he
had
summoned
the
Bahamasâ
first
official
Assembly
composed
of
16
elected
members
for
New
Providence
and
four
each
for
Harbour
Island
and
Eleuthera
At
this
time
in
all
the
Bahamas
there
were
only
about
2,000
settlers
New
Providence
knew
some
spells
of
prosperity
in
the
mid-18th
century
as
privateering
resumed
with
England
at
war
with
Spain
The
town
of
Nassau
expanded
and
improvements
were
made
between
1760
and
1768
by
another
revered
governor
William
Shirley
from
Massachusetts
The
American
Revolutionary
War
When
the
13
American
colonies
enraged
by
the
Stamp
Tax
got
into
the
war
that
eventually
brought
independence
the
Bahamas
somewhat
reluctantly
found
itself
on
Englandâs
side
But
reluctance
dissolved
as
profits
from
privateering
once
again
flowed
into
Nassau
This
time
the
plundered
vessels
were
American
but
not
all
the
victories
were
won
by
the
privateers
On
March
1776
rebel
squadron
under
Commodore
Esek
Hopkins
arrived
and
occupied
Nassau
for
two
weeks
bloodless
undertaking
that
emptied
the
islandâs
forts
of
arms
and
other
military
supplies
smaller
and
equally
non-violent
American
operation
against
the
town
in
January
1778
lasted
less
than
three
days
As
the
coloniesâ
war
effort
picked
up
steam
both
France
and
Spain
weighed
in
against
the
British
In
May
1782
New
Providence
surrendered
to
large
Spanish-American
invasion
fleet
from
Cuba
and
for
the
next
year
Spanish
governor
ruled
the
Bahamas
News
traveled
slowly
in
those
days
The
Treaty
of
Versailles
in
1783
formally
restored
the
Bahamas
to
the
British
but
actual
liberation
came
through
famous
escapade
that
would
never
have
happened
in
the
age
of
the
telegraph
Lieutenant-Colonel
Andrew
Deveaux
loyalist
from
South
Carolina
sailed
from
Florida
with
six
ships
picked
up
men
and
fishing
boats
at
Harbour
Island
and
Eleuthera
and
âinvadedâ
Nassau
Though
vastly
outnumbered
and
outgunned
Deveaux
employed
elaborate
ruses
with
his
little
boats
to
convince
the
Spanish
defenders
that
his
force
was
overpowering
The
humiliating
Spanish
surrender
is
proudly
recalled
in
Bahamian
history
even
though
it
was
all
unnecessary:
the
peace
treaty
had
been
signed
the
previous
week
Deveaux
was
the
first
of
some
7,000
loyalists
who
with
slaves
and
the
promise
of
land
grants
came
to
the
Bahamas
from
the
southern
American
colonies
in
the
wake
of
the
English
defeat
in
the
Revolutionary
War
This
influx
profoundly
affected
the
islands
number
of
prominent
Bahamians
today
are
the
descendants
of
loyalists
or
their
slaves
As
reward
for
his
efforts
Deveaux
was
given
acreage
on
both
New
Providence
and
Cat
Island
Other
loyalists
set
up
cotton
plantations
on
various
islands
and
slaves
soon
became
the
majority
of
the
population
Emancipation
and
Decline
In
the
1780s
well
over
100
cotton
plantations
were
founded
and
flourished
around
the
Bahamas
Prosperity
from
the
land
finally
seemed
possibility
But
by
the
end
of
the
century
cotton
had
fallen
victim
to
devastating
plague
of
chenille
bugs
and
exhaustion
of
the
weak
soil
Most
of
the
planters
left
the
islands
and
depression
returned
only
partly
relieved
by
âwrecking,â
the
freelance
business
of
salvaging
cargo
from
the
ships
forever
running
aground
in
the
dangerous
Bahamian
waters
(Some
ships
were
deliberately
misguided
by
lights
on
shore;
Nassau
harbor
did
not
have
proper
lighthouse
until
1816)
Nassau
became
free
port
in
1787
sparking
surge
in
trading
activity
Loyalists
built
number
of
the
attractive
colonial-style
homes
and
public
buildings
still
standing
today
and
during
the
War
of
1812
privateers
enjoyed
another
profitable
spell
against
American
vessels
Slavery
in
the
Bahamas
was
not
as
widespread
or
as
vicious
as
on
many
sugar
islands
in
the
Caribbean
Some
slaves
were
voluntarily
freed
or
sold
their
liberty
by
loyalist
owners
After
1804
no
slaves
were
imported
into
the
Bahamas
By
1822
the
first
registration
counted
10,808
slaves
on
the
17
inhabited
islands
or
island
clusters
After
Parliament
in
London
abolished
slavery
in
1833
there
was
transitional
apprenticeship
period
of
years
before
all
slaves
in
the
colony
became
fully
free
on
August
1838
This
included
few
thousand
slaves
from
ships
captured
by
the
Royal
Navy
They
were
housed
in
specially
founded
settlements
on
New
Providence
and
the
Out
Islands
Civil
War
Blockade
Running
Over
the
centuries
trouble
on
the
nearby
American
continent
has
often
meant
good
news
for
the
Bahamas
When
Lincoln
ordered
blockade
of
the
southern
states
in
1861
after
the
outbreak
of
the
Civil
War
the
Bahamas
quickly
boomed
Nassau
harbor
was
busy
with
ships
unloading
Confederate
cotton
and
tobacco
and
taking
aboard
arms
medicine
and
manufactured
goods
mainly
from
Europe
to
be
run
back
through
the
northern
blockade
As
the
war
went
on
speedy
and
camouflaged
contraband
vessels
were
built
to
slip
past
the
ever-increasing
Federal
patrols
Profits
from
blockade
running
were
incredible
and
Nassau
went
wild
But
the
extravagant
parties
and
carefree
spending
stopped
abruptly
with
the
Northâs
victory
in
1865
Late
the
following
year
an
immense
hurricane
sent
tidal
wave
over
Hog
Island
(today
Paradise
Island)
smashing
Nassauâs
flimsy
buildings
and
ruining
crops
Other
islands
were
also
devastated
As
the
Bahamas
sank
back
into
economic
doldrums
citizens
turned
to
agriculture
fishing
or
salt
raking
The
spread
of
lighthouses
and
decent
navigational
charts
had
crippled
the
old
standby
the
wrecking
trade
For
time
new
fiber
called
sisal
seemed
promising
But
Bahamian
soil
was
too
poor
and
Mexico
grew
better
plant
Neville
Chamberlain
future
British
Prime
Minister
took
over
his
familyâs
sisal
operation
on
Andros
in
the
1890s
It
failed
the
natives
said
because
of
that
islandâs
evil
elves
called
chickcharnies
who
cast
spell
on
the
family
for
disturbing
the
land
Hopes
were
raised
and
also
fizzled
over
Bahamian
citrus
and
pineapple
Sponging
another
vitally
important
industry
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century
also
had
setbacks
hurricane
in
1839
drowned
some
300
sponge
fishermen
in
the
âmudâ
off
Andros
and
devastating
fungus
some
40
years
later
killed
almost
all
the
sponges
The
20th
Century
Desperate
for
work
perhaps
20
percent
of
the
Bahamian
population
left
to
take
construction
jobs
in
Florida
between
the
turn
of
the
century
and
World
War
I
During
that
war
hundreds
of
Bahamians
saw
active
service
with
British
forces
The
islands
suffered
food
shortages
and
serious
bank
failure
but
nothing
more
threatening
militarily
than
rumors
of
German
submarines
offshore
Prohibition
brought
gloom
to
millions
of
Americans
but
for
the
Bahamas
it
brought
the
biggest
bonanza
in
history
At
the
end
of
1919
Congress
passed
the
Volstead
Act
outlawing
the
manufacture
sale
or
transport
of
intoxicating
beverages
The
Bahamian
islands
(where
the
temperance
crusade
never
had
much
chance)
were
perfectly
placed
to
help
thirsty
Americans
For
14
years
until
the
controversial
law
was
finally
repealed
bootlegging
changed
Nassau
West
End
on
Grand
Bahama
and
Bimini
beyond
recognition
With
just
as
much
gusto
as
theyâd
shown
in
the
past
for
wrecking
privateering
and
blockade
running
Bahamians
took
to
the
seas
with
illegal
liquor
Trying
to
outwit
the
US
Coast
Guard
was
risky
but
enormously
profitable
Fortunes
were
made
by
respected
Bahamian
families
turned
liquor
merchants
rum-running
boat
captains
notorious
criminals
shady
ladies
and
the
Bahamas
government
(which
collected
duty
on
temporarily
imported
drink)
Liquor
money
bought
Nassau
better
houses
churches
lighting
water
roads
sewers
docks
and
hotels
The
cityâs
first
gambling
casino
opened
in
1920;
the
first
daily
air
service
from
Miami
began
in
1929;
the
yacht
set
decided
Nassau
was
fashionable
and
many
wealthy
Americans
as
well
as
Prohibition
millionaires
built
homes
on
the
islands
When
the
boom
suddenly
came
to
an
end
with
the
worldwide
depression
and
the
repeal
of
Prohibition
in
1933
unemployment
rose
again
despite
the
first
significant
tourism
the
Bahamas
had
known
In
some
respects
World
War
II
put
the
Bahamas
on
the
international
map
The
colony
was
chosen
to
have
two
of
the
sites
Britain
leased
to
the
United
States
under
Franklin
D
Rooseveltâs
âdestroyers
for
basesâ
deal
in
1940
Allied
forces
operated
submarine-hunting
and
air-sea
rescue
stations
on
the
islands;
Royal
Air
Force
pilots
and
Royal
Navy
frogmen
were
trained
here
and
much
trans-Atlantic
air
traffic
passed
through
the
Bahamas
Then
to
the
astonishment
of
the
local
populace
the
Duke
of
Windsor
having
given
up
his
throne
for
an
American
divorcÃ©e
was
named
governor
of
the
little
colony
in
1940
He
and
the
Duchess
remained
until
1945
In
1943
the
Duke
intervened
in
the
investigation
of
the
murder
of
Canadian
multimillionaire
Sir
Harry
Oakes
longtime
benefactor
of
the
Bahamas
who
gave
his
name
to
Nassauâs
first
airfield
The
sensational
case
never
solved
made
world
headlines
for
the
Bahamas
and
is
still
discussed
today
After
the
construction
of
the
first
wartime
American
air
bases
on
New
Providence
was
completed
thousands
of
Bahamians
left
to
work
on
farms
and
in
factories
in
the
United
States
migration
that
continued
well
into
the
postwar
era
But
employment
opportunities
began
to
grow
at
home
From
1950
promotion
campaign
under
Sir
Stafford
Sands
was
hugely
successful
in
attracting
tourists
to
the
Bahamas
Denied
the
sun
sand
and
sin
of
Cuba
by
Fidel
Castroâs
takeover
in
1959
hundreds
of
thousands
of
American
vacationers
set
their
sights
on
the
Bahamas
The
influx
was
spurred
by
gambling
airport
and
harbor
improvement
on
the
major
islands
and
the
creation
of
the
modern
city
of
Freeport
(which
had
been
set
in
motion
by
the
so-called
Hawksbill
Creek
Agreement
of
1955)
Resort
hotels
began
to
appear
and
the
advent
of
air-conditioning
improved
the
often
stifling
humidity
of
summer
Under
new
constitution
in
1964
the
colony
was
given
self-government
with
ministerial-parliamentary
system
In
1967
elections
the
Progressive
Liberal
Party
was
victorious
its
leader
Lynden
O
Pindling
becoming
premier
Following
constitutional
conference
in
London
the
Bahamas
became
fully
independent
on
July
10
1973
and
is
now
member
of
the
United
Nations
and
the
British
Commonwealth
In
August
1992
the
Progressive
Liberal
Party
still
headed
by
Lynden
O
Pindling
was
toppled
by
the
Free
National
Movement
after
25
years
in
power
Todayâs
prime
minister
is
Hubert
Ingraham
Since
independence
the
Bahamas
has
kept
British
systems
of
judiciary
and
government
yet
has
moved
closer
economically
to
its
near
neighbor
the
US
The
Bahamian
Government
has
deliberately
pursued
tourism
as
the
major
industry
of
the
Bahamian
commonwealth
and
is
happy
to
welcome
many
millions
of
visitors
to
its
shores
The
growth
in
cruise
traffic
has
been
particularly
strong
The
other
islands
called
the
Family
Islands
by
the
government
but
generally
referred
to
as
the
Out
Islands
by
the
tourist
trade
have
not
shared
this
huge
growth
in
numbers
of
visitors
Together
they
offer
tourists
almost
any
form
of
vacation
experience
from
the
bustle
of
the
busy
city
to
the
silence
of
the
desert
island
In
the
1990s
the
Bahamian
Government
began
working
on
ways
to
expand
the
countryâs
economic
base
While
tourism
remains

Atlantis
resort
on
Paradise
Island
leaves
little
doubt
about
thatÂ âÂ a
number
of
measures
have
also
been
taken
to
make
the
countryâs
laws
and
tax
codes
more
attractive
to
offshore
investors
As
result
money
has
been
making
its
way
into
financial
institutions
on
the
Bahamas
from
around
the
world
and
large
number
of
foreign
banks
have
opened
brand-new
air-conditioned
offices
surrounded
by
carefully
manicured
gardens
One
of
the
major
questions
still
facing
the
Bahamas
is
how
to
accommodate
the
increasing
numbers
of
tourists
while
still
preserving
the
special
architectural
and
social
heritage
of
the
Out
Islands
as
well
as
of
the
major
towns
like
Nassau
Will
it
be
possible
to
enjoy
the
natural
splendors
of
places
like
Inagua
without
upsetting
the
delicate
balance
of
nature?
At
the
moment
the
thinking
is
that
itâs
perhaps
best
to
leave
these
smaller
less
developed
islands
in
peace
Brief
History
Little
is
known
of
the
earliest
Stone
Age
inhabitants
of
Europeâs
southwestern
extremity
The
ancient
Greeks
called
them
the
Cynetes
(or
Cunetes)
Whatever
their
origins
their
culture
evolved
under
the
pressure
and
influence
of
foreign
forces
Among
the
many
invading
armies
that
settled
here
and
contributed
to
nascent
Portuguese
culture
were
Phoenicians
who
settled
in
the
area
around
1,000
b.c.
followed
by
the
Celts
Iberians
Greeks
and
Carthaginians
But
it
was
the
Romans
who
arrived
late
in
the
third
century
b.c.
who
most
greatly
influenced
all
of
Iberia
They
built
towns
industries
roads
and
bridges
developed
agriculture
and
bequeathed
the
Latin
language
of
which
Portuguese
is
direct
descendant
The
Romans
named
the
southwestern
province
of
the
peninsula
Lusitania
oddly
enough
for
one
of
the
Celtiberian
tribes
they
defeated
and
by
the
third
century
a.d
had
introduced
Christianity
By
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
the
Algarve
had
bishop
in
place
based
in
Faro
But
Rome
had
already
fallen
into
decay
and
soon
hordes
of
northern
tribesmen
took
over
the
empire
The
Algarve
fell
to
the
Visigoths
in
the
mid-fifth
century
Under
Moorish
Rule
In
a.d
711
the
Moors
brought
powerful
armies
from
North
Africa
and
launched
devastating
attack
on
the
Iberian
peninsula
conquering
much
of
what
would
become
Spain
and
Portugal
They
imposed
Islam
and
left
an
indelible
influence
on
the
countryside
and
the
population
of
the
Algarve
The
Moorish
legacy
can
still
be
seen
in
the
form
of
wells
and
waterwheels
squat
white
houses
the
dark
complexions
of
the
people
and
in
the
very
name
given
the
regionÂ âÂ taken
from
Al-Gharb
which
means
âcountry
of
the
westâ
(when
the
Moors
conquered
the
territory
it
was
the
most
westerly
in
the
known
world)
The
Moors
governed
their
Iberian
kingdoms
from
across
the
border
in
Seville
but
the
Algarve
had
its
own
regional
capital
and
huge
invulnerable
fortress
The
capital
was
Chelb
(or
Xelb)
and
it
was
bigger
and
better
defended
than
Lisbon
Today
the
town
known
as
Silves
(see
page
38)
is
provincial
outpost
whose
only
besiegers
are
busloads
of
tourists
who
climb
the
narrow
streets
up
to
the
old
Moorish
ramparts
The
long
struggle
by
Christians
to
expel
the
Moors
(a
campaign
known
as
the
Reconquista
or
Reconquest)
began
towards
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
a.d
By
the
11th
century
Portucale
consisted
of
small
section
of
Castile
and
LeÃ³n
(todayâs
northern
Portugal)
Yet
it
wasnât
until
the
12th
century
that
significant
gains
were
made
to
take
back
southern
Iberia
The
beginning
of
the
end
came
in
the
Battle
of
Ourique
in
1139
After
the
victory
Count
Afonso
Henriques
proclaimed
himself
the
first
king
of
Portugal
making
it
one
of
the
first
nation-states
in
Europe
The
Reconquest
of
Silves
not
achieved
for
another
50
years
was
grisly
affair
mixed
bag
of
Crusaders
from
northern
Europe
were
recruited
en
route
to
their
battles
east
in
the
Holy
Land
They
sailed
upon
the
river
port
of
Silves
and
ignoring
conditional
offers
of
surrender
slew
all
the
inhabitants
(at
no
small
loss
to
themselves)
and
pillaged
the
great
treasures
of
the
city
Two
years
later
Muslim
forces
rallied
again
retaking
Silves
and
the
Reconquista
stumbled
on
for
another
half
century
So
many
inter-religious
alliances
reigned
and
so
pervasive
was
the
intermingling
of
Moors
and
Christians
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
who
was
on
which
side
and
for
which
piece
of
land
they
were
fighting
On
top
of
that
the
situation
was
further
clouded
by
feud
between
Portugal
and
Spain
each
of
them
claiming
sovereignty
over
the
Algarve
However
by
1249
Faro
and
the
western
Algarve
were
retaken
under
King
Afonso
III
completing
the
Reconquest
The
possibility
of
war
with
Spain
was
averted
by
an
expeditious
royal
marriage
and
by
the
end
of
the
century
treaty
with
Spain
drew
up
the
boundaries
of
Portugal
that
stand
today
The
Algarve
was
region
regarded
separately
within
the
new
Portugal
as
is
evidenced
by
the
royal
title
âKingdom
of
Portugal
and
the
Algarve.â
In
those
days
the
notion
of
the
Algarve
as
distinct
entity
did
make
some
sense:
like
an
island
it
was
cut
off
to
the
south
and
west
by
the
Atlantic
to
the
east
by
the
Guadiana
River
and
to
the
north
by
the
mountains
The
regionâs
titular
autonomy
was
upheld
until
1910
when
the
monarchy
itself
was
overthrown
The
Navigator
In
1415
long
after
the
Reconquista
was
completed
Portuguese
fleet
assembled
on
the
River
Tagus
in
Lisbon
for
an
assault
on
the
Moors
in
their
homeland
Crossing
the
Straits
of
Gibraltar
the
armada
attacked
and
seized
the
North
African
city
of
Ceuta
An
illustrious
member
of
the
famous
raid
was
the
young
Prince
Henry
half
Portuguese
and
half
English
the
son
of
King
JoÃ£o
and
his
wife
Philippa
of
Lancaster
Ceuta
would
be
Henryâs
one
and
only
military
victory
though
he
was
destined
to
establish
Portugal
as
major
world
power
helping
to
develop
important
world
trade
routes
by
the
time
of
his
death
in
1460
At
the
age
of
21
Henry
assembled
School
of
Navigation
It
was
certainly
not
formal
institution
of
lectures
and
classes
but
probably
resembled
an
informal
modern-day
âthink-tank.â
Prince
HenryÂ âÂ made
governor
of
the
Algarve
in
1418Â âÂ had
the
money
influence
enthusiasm
and
vision
to
lead
and
cajole
the
best
astronomers
cartographers
boat-designers
and
seamen
of
the
day
to
expand
Portugalâs
maritime
horizons
The
waters
at
the
western
extreme
of
the
Algarve
were
all
that
was
known
to
sailors
Once
they
were
beyond
Cabo
de
SÃ£o
Vicente
they
faced
the
unknown
with
no
communications
and
no
possibility
of
rescue
if
the
voyage
turned
out
badly
Yet
out
into
the
unknown
they
went;
for
the
glory
of
God
and
country
and
in
search
of
personal
fame
and
fortune
Their
mission
was
made
easier
by
the
craft
Algarve
shipwrights
had
developed
successor
to
the
lumbering
ships
of
the
day:
the
caravel
It
was
light
fast
and
very
maneuverable
Any
breeze
was
enough
for
captain
to
steer
it
where
he
wanted
to
go
With
the
subsequent
development
of
new
navigational
techniques
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
stay
within
sight
of
land
Now
the
only
limits
to
maritime
exploration
were
manâs
ingenuity
and
courage
According
to
tradition
the
site
of
Prince
Henryâs
base
was
the
Sagres
peninsula
(see
page
22)
though
there
is
little
there
today
to
persuade
you
of
this
The
actual
headquarters
of
the
Navigation
School
may
have
been
40
km
(25
miles)
east
in
Lagos
(see
page
26)
This
location
had
port
shipyards
and
was
home
to
the
prince
in
his
role
as
governor
of
the
Algarve
During
Henryâs
lifetime
Portugalâs
caravels
sailed
beyond
the
most
westerly
point
of
Africa
They
colonized
the
Atlantic
islands
of
Madeira
and
the
Azores
laying
the
foundations
for
the
future
Portuguese
empire
Before
the
century
was
over
Henryâs
compatriots
Bartolomeu
Dias
and
Vasco
da
Gama
completed
epic
voyages
rounding
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
and
reaching
India
respectively
and
Pedro
Ãlves
Cabral
claimed
Brazil
Between
1519
and
1522
another
Portuguese
explorer
Ferdinand
Magellan
led
the
first
expedition
to
circumnavigate
the
world
Mercantilist
Portugal
became
rich
maritime
superpower
Foreign
Intrigues
To
protect
its
seagoing
interests
and
trade
routes
Portugal
established
strategic
garrisons
in
Goa
(India)
Malacca
(East
Indies)
and
Hormuz
in
the
Persian
Gulf
Portuguese
explorers
then
embarked
upon
Macau
(now
Macao)
the
Congo
and
various
other
parts
of
Africa
including
the
Sudan
The
Portuguese
policy
was
to
avoid
armed
strife
and
to
develop
trade
empire
rather
than
to
conquer
nations
To
this
end
it
succeeded
with
relatively
few
blood-soaked
episodes
in
its
colonial
history
Adventures
abroad
however
proved
disastrous
during
the
second
half
of
the
16th
century
In
1557
the
14-year-old
boy-king
SebastiÃ£o
ascended
the
throne
the
beginning
of
calamitous
reign
that
was
to
end
at
the
battle
of
Alcacer-Quiber
(Morocco)
in
pursuit
of
vain
crusade
SebastiÃ£oâs
untimely
demise
alongside
some
18,000
ill-prepared
badly
led
followers
set
the
stage
for
crisis
of
succession
For
many
years
afterwards
legends
and
rumors
bizarrely
insisted
that
the
king
was
still
alive
and
imposters
turned
up
from
time
to
time
claiming
the
throne;
those
who
were
plausible
enough
to
be
deemed
threat
were
summarily
executed
In
fact
the
only
rightful
claimant
to
the
crown
was
the
elderly
Prince
Henry
But
after
two
years
of
alternating
between
the
throne
and
his
sickbed
he
died
heirless
Surveying
the
situation
and
smelling
an
opportunity
Spain
occupied
the
power
vacuum
and
Portugalâs
neighbor
and
long-time
antagonist
became
its
master
Spanish
rule
dictated
Portugalâs
inadvertent
involvement
in
Spainâs
ongoing
wars
In
1587
squadron
of
British
ships
commanded
by
Francis
Drake
attacked
the
Algarve
(now
âlegitimate
targetâ
as
Spanish
territory)
and
sacked
Sagres
thus
depriving
the
world
of
the
relics
of
Henry
the
Navigator
Nine
years
later
Faro
was
torched
The
1386
Treaty
of
Windsor
by
which
Britain
and
Portugal
had
pledged
eternal
friendship
seemed
distant
memory
Portugalâs
empire
was
gradually
eroded
and
many
of
its
trading
posts
(with
the
notable
exception
of
Brazil)
were
picked
off
by
the
British
and
Dutch
Finally
after
60
years
of
Spanish
rule
Portuguese
noblemen
(aided
by
the
French
then
at
war
with
Spain)
organized
palace
coup
and
restored
independence
The
Great
Disaster
Portugalâs
greatest
misfortune
struck
on
All
Saintâs
Day
November
1755
With
the
candlelit
churches
crowded
with
worshippers
monstrous
earthquake
struck
followed
by
fast-spreading
fires
and
devastating
tidal
wave
that
swept
over
the
Algarve
inland
as
far
as
6.5
km
(4
miles)
The
exact
casualty
figure
will
never
be
known
but
it
is
estimated
that
5,000
died
immediately
and
between
40,000
and
60,000
perished
as
result
of
secondary
injuries
and
the
ensuing
famine
and
pestilence
The
epicenter
of
the
earthquake
is
thought
to
have
been
off
the
Algarve
coast
possibly
between
Tavira
and
Faro
but
it
devastated
places
as
far
away
as
the
capital
Lisbon
Witnesses
claim
to
have
seen
fiery
volcano
erupt
from
beneath
the
sea
just
before
the
first
jolt
Throughout
the
Algarve
and
much
of
the
rest
of
southern
Portugal
virtually
every
important
monument
cathedral
castle
and
mansion
was
destroyed
or
at
least
critically
damaged
in
the
earthquake
Among
the
hardest
hit
towns
was
Lagos
(see
page
26)
which
lost
its
castle
its
churches
and
the
palace
in
which
Henry
the
Navigator
had
once
lived
Political
Upheaval
The
beginning
of
the
19th
century
brought
further
alarm
to
the
country
This
time
the
epicenter
was
Paris
and
the
cause
Napoleon
Just
as
Portugalâs
forced
alliance
with
Spain
had
made
the
country
target
for
Drakeâs
16th-century
raids
now
her
friendly
alliance
with
England
rankled
Napoleon
In
1807
the
French
invaded
Lisbon
causing
the
royal
family
to
flee
to
Brazil
Spain
followed
by
Portugal
rose
up
against
the
French
occupation
in
what
came
to
be
known
as
the
Peninsular
War
Among
the
early
blows
struck
for
independence
was
rebellion
in
the
town
of
OlhÃ£o
(see
page
57)
On
16
June
1808
the
townsfolkÂ âÂ armed
with
little
more
than
ancient
swords
spears
and
stonesÂ âÂ attacked
and
captured
the
local
French
garrison
Itâs
said
that
party
of
local
men
then
set
sail
from
OlhÃ£o
all
the
way
to
Brazil
without
maps
or
navigational
aids
to
tell
the
king
of
the
insurrection
The
real
battle
however
was
waged
under
the
leadership
of
the
Duke
of
Wellington
whose
coalition
forces
expelled
the
French
after
two
years
of
bitter
fighting
The
war
left
Portugal
further
weakened
and
in
1822
its
major
empire
outpost
Brazil
declared
independence
At
the
same
time
dispute
over
the
crown
continually
raged
between
Pedro
IV
the
absentee
monarch
who
preferred
to
reign
as
Emperor
of
Brazil
rather
than
return
to
Portugal
and
his
brother
Miguel
The
power
struggle
with
strong
overtones
of
absolutism
versus
liberalism
excited
the
interest
and
intervention
of
other
powers
With
British
help
Pedro
defeated
Miguel
off
Cape
St
Vincent
in
1833
and
his
expeditionary
force
marched
to
Lisbon
Pedro
took
the
throne
though
armed
struggle
continued
for
months
and
the
lingering
bitterness
long
after
that
By
1892
Portugal
racked
by
wars
and
the
continuing
expense
of
maintaining
its
African
colonies
(including
those
of
Mozambique
and
Angola)
declared
itself
bankrupt
The
seeds
of
discontent
with
absolutist
rule
were
sown
Kingdomâs
End
Bloodshed
would
haunt
the
remaining
years
of
the
Portuguese
monarchy
On
February
1908
the
royal
family
was
riding
in
an
open
carriage
along
the
Lisbon
river
front
plaza
Terreiro
do
PaÃ§o
when
an
assassin
opened
fire
and
killed
King
Carlos
and
the
heir
to
the
throne
Prince
Luis
Filipe
The
princeâs
younger
brother
Prince
Manuel
was
also
hit
but
he
survived
and
was
thus
propelled
to
the
throne
at
the
tender
age
of
19
Amid
republican
agitation
surprise
uprising
led
by
elements
within
the
armed
forces
deposed
Manuel
in
1910
Having
ruled
for
less
than
three
years
Manuel
died
in
exile
in
1932
in
England
The
sudden
end
of
more
than
seven
centuries
of
monarchy
brought
confusion
and
crisis
to
the
country
Presidents
and
prime
ministers
were
ushered
into
and
out
of
office
an
unbelievable
45
times
between
1910
and
1926
until
military
revolution
suspended
Portugalâs
problematic
democracy
After
six
years
of
power
General
Oscar
Carmona
appointed
his
finance
minister
AntÃ³nio
de
Oliveira
Salazar
to
be
Prime
Minister
position
he
was
to
hold
until
1968
Salazarâs
repressive
rule
and
austerity
measures
rid
the
Portuguese
economy
of
debt
though
poverty
increased
Portugal
remained
neutral
during
World
War
II
and
Salazar
demonstrated
his
financial
acumen
by
selling
materials
and
supplies
to
both
sides
In
1968
the
elderly
Salazar
was
forced
into
retirement
after
stroke
His
successor
Dr
Marcelo
Caetano
feeling
the
spirit
of
the
age
began
tentative
relaxations
of
the
old
regime
The
armed
forces
finally
overthrew
him
in
popular
bloodless
coup
known
as
the
âCarnation
Revolution,â
on
25
April
1974
Portugal
finally
began
to
pull
itself
out
of
the
long
and
fruitless
struggle
against
revolutionaries
in
its
African
colonies
and
granted
independence
to
the
remaining
members
of
its
empire
in
1975
This
too
caused
major
upheavals
and
million
permanent
refugees
rushed
the
motherland
aggravating
the
shortage
of
housing
and
jobs
Although
economic
problems
continued
to
beset
the
young
democracy
the
political
scene
was
greatly
stabilized
In
1986
Portugal
the
former
poor
backwater
of
Europe
joined
the
European
Economic
Community
(now
the
European
Union
or
EU)
With
aid
from
the
EU
Portugal
became
one
of
the
fastest-growing
countries
in
Europe
The

already
favorite
of
sun-seeking

lovers
from

Brief
History
Todayâs
Indonesians
mainly
descend
from
people
who
came
from
south
China
via
the
Malay
peninsula
and
moved
along
the
island
chain
to
Java
Bali
Lombok
and
beyond
from
3000
to
1000
b.c
Archaeological
finds
show
that
there
was
flourishing
Bronze
Age
culture
in
Bali
and
Lombok
between
about
1000
and
100
b.c
Trade
and
cultural
exchanges
with
Southeast
Asia
had
certainly
begun
by
that
period
and
there
were
frequent
contacts
with
India
by
a.d.Â 100
About
this
time
too
wet
rice
cultivation
was
introduced
to
Bali
changing
the
face
of
the
countryside
to
its
present
appearance
of
rice
paddy
fields
and
terraces
Indian
traders
and
teachers
brought
Buddhism
to
Java
It
had
only
limited
influence
in
Bali
however
where
people
continued
in
their
ancient
animist
beliefs
worshipping
the
spirits
of
the
mountains
rivers
and
other
natural
forces
Hinduism
Comes
to
Bali
In
the
eighth
and
ninth
centuries
a.d.
several
Buddhist
rulers
in
Java
converted
to
Hinduism
along
with
their
subjects
This
time
many
people
in
Bali
followed
suit
perhaps
attracted
by
the
complex
Hindu
mythology
the
Balinese
today
still
have
love
of
the
old
stories
and
by
the
way
their
local
gods
could
be
housed
easily
in
the
crowded
Hindu
pantheon
Around
930
the
kingdom
of
East
Java
conquered
Bali
and
the
conversion
process
accelerated
mild
form
of
the
caste
system
and
the
concept
of
the
Hindu
trinity
of
Brahma
Shiva
and
Vishnu
were
introduced
But
Bali
was
no
mere
vassal
state
of
Java
From
1019
to
1042
Airlangga
son
of
the
Balinese
king
Udayana
ruled
over
East
Java
with
the
help
of
Javanese
princess
while
his
young
brother
acted
as
regent
in
Bali
During
the
12th
and
13th
centuries
Bali
was
often
independent
powerful
Hindu
empire
named
after
its
capital
Majapahit
united
all
of
Java
by
1320
The
Majapahit
general
Gajah
Mada
reconquered
Bali
in
1343
and
annexed
large
part
of
the
Indonesian
archipelago
Hindu
art
and
scholarship
spread
through
the
islands
but
on
most
of
the
islands
this
flowering
was
short-lived
With
the
death
in
1389
of
King
Hayam
Wurukin
its
last
great
ruler
the
empire
of
Majapahit
began
toÂ decline
Muslim
traders
and
teachers
had
already
started
converting
several
of
Javaâs
princes
and
people
to
Islam
especially
in
coastal
areas
and
in
the
14th
and
15th
centuries
the
movement
spread
to
the
interior
By
the
year
1500
seeing
their
world
breaking
up
many
Majapahit
aristocrats
priests
and
scholars
fled
to
Bali
where
their
culture
continued
to
flourish
Islam
never
gained
strong
foothold
in
Bali
which
was
difficult
to
invade
because
of
its
many
reefs
and
lack
of
harbors
and
had
few
products
to
attract
traders
The
early
16th
century
also
brought
the
first
European
ships
to
Indonesian
waters
when
the
Portuguese
came
in
search
of
spices
and
set
up
trading
posts
though
not
on
Bali
In
1550
Bali
was
united
under
Batu
Renggong
the
formidable
ruler
known
as
Dewa
Agung
(god-king)
of
Gelgel
near
Klungkung
His
men
even
succeeded
in
turning
back
the
tide
of
Islam
for
short
while
adding
eastern
Java
and
Lombok
to
his
domains
During
his
rule
Balinese
power
culture
and
influence
reached
peak
with
boom
in
temple
building
and
the
associated
crafts
of
sculpture
and
woodcarving
During
the
next
250
years
Baliâs
rulers
fell
to
squabbling
among
themselves
and
the
island
split
into
ten
or
more
rajadoms
Baliâs
contact
with
the
Dutch
was
restricted
to
providing
slaves
mainly
Balinese
who
had
broken
the
rajasâ
laws
or
priestsâ
taboos
and
soldiers
for
the
army
of
the
United
Dutch
East
Indies
Company
(Vereenigde
Oostindische
Compagnie
or
VOC)
The
company
was
the
instrument
of
influence
of
the
Netherlands
until
it
went
bankrupt
in
1799
and
was
superseded
by
the
government
Throughout
the
18th
century
Dutch
influence
and
authority
slowly
spread
across
the
Indonesian
archipelago
but
bypassed
the
relatively
poor
unimportant
island
ofÂ Bali
Between
1811
and
1817
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
Britain
took
control
of
Indonesia
and
seriously
thought
of
staying
once
the
wars
were
over
Britainâs
administrator
Stamford
Raffles
who
was
named
Lieutenant
Governor
even
visited
Bali
and
may
have
had
it
in
mind
to
build
trading
station
here
After
the
war
however
the
British
government
decided
to
restore
Dutch
territory
and
interests
and
Raffles
found
another
site
the
island
and
future
port
of
Singapore
The
Dutch
Take
Over
Once
re-established
in
Java
the
Dutch
attempted
to
increase
their
influence
and
also
to
prevent
the
Balinese
from
plundering
ships
wrecked
off
the
coast
(the
Balinese
considered
shipwrecks
to
be
gifts
from
the
deities
of
the
seas
and
felt
it
would
be
insulting
to
refuse
them)
Following
the
looting
of
ship
in
1841
the
Dutch
decided
to
use
force
Some
1,600
men
recruited
mainly
from
other
Indonesian
islands
landed
on
the
north
coast
in
1846
and
burned
Singaraja
Immediately
the
Balinese
rajas
agreed
to
stop
the
plundering
of
wrecks
and
to
pay
compensation
for
the
1841
incident
but
it
soon
became
clear
that
they
had
no
intention
of
honoring
the
deal
In
1848
the
Dutch
landed
second
military
expedition
in
the
north
of
Bali
Advancing
inland
to
attack
theÂ Balinese
base
at
Jagaraga
they
were
ambushed
by
bigger
but
less
well-armed
force
led
by
Jelantik
younger
brother
of
the
Raja
of
Bululeng
In
spite
of
appalling
losses
the
Balinese
won
the
day
The
defeated
Dutch
invaders
retreated
in
disorder
to
their
ships
but
the
following
year
third
Dutch
military
expedition
far
stronger
than
its
predecessors
landed
near
Singaraja
The
northern
rajadoms
sued
for
peace;
they
were
offered
terms
calling
for
them
to
disarm
and
submit
to
Dutch
rule
The
response
of
Jelantik
was
to
fall
back
to
Jagaraga
and
prepare
to
fight
This
time
the
Balinese
were
overwhelmed
and
thousands
were
killed
some
in
suicidal
march
towards
enemy
guns
ritual
death
in
battle
known
in
the
Balinese
language
as
puputan
After
second
Dutch
landing
at
Padangbai
Bay
the
puputan
ritual
was
repeated
when
the
Raja
of
Karangasem
and
his
family
threw
themselves
on
the
enemy
guns
During
the
rest
of
the
19th
century
the
Dutch
using
the
rajas
and
other
aristocrats
as
regents
took
control
over
most
of
Bali
but
their
influence
in
the
south
remained
limited
This
was
emphasized
in
1904
when
ship
wrecked
off
Sanur
was
plundered
of
its
cargo
The
Dutch
demanded
reparations
for
this
act;
the
southern
rajas
refused
In
1906
force
of
mainly
Moluccan
troops
led
by
Dutch
officers
marched
on
Denpasar
to
enforce
compliance
They
found
the
place
almost
deserted
until
suddenly
the
Raja
of
Badung
together
with
his
family
and
hundreds
of
courtiers
emerged
from
the
palace
On
signal
from
the
raja
one
of
his
priests
stabbed
him
with
kris
(knife)
and
then
pausing
only
to
stab
their
children
first
the
rest
of
the
royal
party
began
puputan
either
killing
themselves
or
running
suicidally
towards
the
enemy
When
the
dreadful
scene
was
repeated
by
the
Dewa
Agung
and
his
wives
and
followers
in
1908
in
front
of
the
palace
at
Klungkung
the
rajasâ
resistance
to
Dutch
rule
was
at
an
end
The
public
in
the
Netherlands
was
appalled
by
these
grisly
events
From
then
on
Bali
and
the
Balinese
came
to
be
looked
on
as
unique
to
be
protected
from
the
colonial
treatment
that
had
turned
the
other
islands
into
plantations
exploited
for
profit
Tourism
was
discouraged
although
few
foreigners
did
make
the
journey
and
returned
to
the
outside
world
with
news
of
the
islandâs
extraordinary
culture
An
American
couple
Bob
and
Louise
Koke
opened
the
first
hotel
on
Kuta
Beach
in
1936;
Louise
G
Kokeâs
memoir
Our
Hotel
In
Bali
provides
an
idyllic
portrait
of
Baliâs
first
tenuous
endeavor
at
tourism
from
1936
until
the
Japanese
invasion
in
1942
During
the
1920s
and
1930s
Cokorde
Gde
Agung
Sukawati
ruler
of
Ubud
extended
long
Sukawati
family
tradition
of
patronizing
talent
and
craftsmanship
by
hosting
visiting
Western
artists
including
the
German
painter
Walter
Spies
who
stayed
for
14
years
Spiesâ
influence
revolutionized
painting
in
Bali
which
had
previously
been
one
of
the
least
inventive
of
Baliâs
arts
bound
by
repetitive
conventions
The
Pita
Maha
school
of
young
Western-influenced
artists
emerged
(also
influenced
by
the
Dutch
pastel-ist
Rudolf
Bonnet)
putting
Ubud
on
the
world
map
of
contemporary
art
Spiesâ
house
and
spring-fed
swimming
pool
(now
part
of
the
Tjampuhan
Hotel)
were
visited
by
Western
artists
academics
musicians
and
stars
of
theater
and
film
Deeply
involved
in
Balinese
culture
Spies
himself
choreographed
the
still-performed
version
of
the
most
famous
Balinese
dance
the
kecak
based
on
story
from
the
âRamayana.â
When
Germany
invaded
Holland
in
1940
Spies
was
interned
as
an
enemy
alien
He
died
in
1942
when
ship
on
which
he
was
being
transported
to
British
Ceylon
was
torpedoed
by
theÂ Japanese
From
1900
until
the
start
of
World
War
II
many
young
Indonesians
received
Dutch
education
with
the
brightest
students
going
to
universities
in
the
Netherlands
The
Dutch
language
gave
the
vast
polyglot
archipelago
sense
of
unity
even
among
islands
that
had
been
bitter
enemies
for
centuries
Indonesian
nationalism
and
movement
for
independence
from
Holland
gained
strength
War
and
Independence
Early
in
1942
soon
after
their
attacks
on
Pearl
Harbor
and
Singapore
the
Japanese
invaded
and
occupied
Indonesia
with
the
intention
of
exploiting
its
oil
and
rice
Until
the
end
of
World
War
II
the
difficult
Japanese
occupation
continued;
with
the
surrender
of
Japan
in
August
1945
Indonesia
declared
its
independence
The
years
from
1946
to
1949
saw
the
Dutch
trying
to
reassert
control;
however
weakened
as
it
was
from
years
of
Nazi
occupation
the
Netherlands
was
not
able
to
muster
the
huge
forces
needed
to
recapture
all
theÂ islands
On
Bali
in
November
1946
Indonesian
nationalist
fighters
led
by
Ngurah
Rai
found
themselves
trapped
by
Dutch
forces
close
to
Marga
north
of
Tabenan
Outnumbered
and
outgunned
Ngurah
Rai
and
all
96
of
his
followers
were
killed
in
what
is
regarded
as
Baliâs
last
puputan
Their
sacrifice
is
commemorated
by
monument
and
museum
at
the
site
together
with
stones
bearing
the
names
of
each
of
those
who
died
on
the
island
of
Bali
during
the
struggle
for
independence
(see

Finally
on
17
August
1950
five
years
to
the
day
after
independence
was
first
declared
the
fledgling
Republic
of
Indonesia
was
recognized
by
the
Netherlands
Sukarno
preeminent
in
the
nationalist
movement
emerged
as
the
new
nationâs
leader
The
1955
Afro-Asian
conference
in
Bandung
heralded
the
arrival
of
the
new
nation
and
its
leader
Sukarno
was
welcomed
to
the
world
stage
Together
with
Indiaâs
Nehru
and
Tito
of
Yugoslavia
he
was
credited
with
the
foundation
of
the
non-aligned
movement
Years
of
Confusion
succession

groups
dislocation
caused
by
war
and
its
aftermath
badly
neglected
infrastructure
and
the
colo-nial
legacy
of
over-exploited
plantations
Frustrated
by
Indonesiaâs
loss
of
direction
Sukarno
declared
form
of
martial
law
in
1957
so-called
âguided
democracyâ
and
an
appointed
national
council
and
non-party
government
took
the
place
of
the
elected
assembly
and
ineffectual
coalitions
The
period
between
1959
and
1965
was
surreal
time
of
government
by
means
of
slogans
and
Orwellian
acronyms
Sukarno
attempted
to
control
the
competing
nationalist
religious
and
communist
groups;
NASAKOM
was
the
word
he
used
to
represent
their
supposed
common
interests
As
if
that
wasnât
enough
processions
paraded
with
placards
emblazoned
with
MANIPOL
(Sukarnoâs
political
manifesto)
and
DEKON
(his
economic
declaration)
written
on
them
and
there
were
others
which
condemned
NEKOLIM
(neo-colonialism
and
imperialism)
In
the
meantime
the
Indonesian
economy
collapsed
and
hyper-inflation
destroyed
the
currency
The
countryâs
limited
foreign-exchange
reserves
were
squandered
on
window-dressing
projects
grand
monuments
and
stadiums
to
host
the
Asian
Games
of
1962
seen
as
part
of
plan
to
bring
Indonesia
into
the
world
spotlight
International
travel
agents
were
given
tour
of
the
country
including
visit
to
Bali
that
coincided
with
an
important
Balinese
ceremony
in
March
1963
at
the
so-called
âmother
templeâ
Besakih
on
the
slopes
of
the
islandâs
highest
mountain
Gunung
Agung
Portentously
Gunung
Agung
though
long
dormant
chose
this
particular
moment
to
begin
emitting
smoke
and
firing
rocks
into
the
air
but
the
ceremony
went
ahead
anyway
literally
under
cloud
The
official
guests
had
scarcely
left
Bali
when
Gunung
Agung
exploded
in
what
was
the
most
violent
eruption
the
island
had
seen
in
centuries
Lava
flowed
down
its
slopes
but
despite
the
impressions
conveyed
by
reporters
(and
by
photographs
seen
in
many
books)
it
covered
only
limited
area
The
chief
instrument
of
destruction
was
the
volcanic
ash
that
showered
down
on
the
northern
half
of
Bali
covering
it
with
layer
40Â cm
(15Â inches)
thick
Crops
were
wiped
out;
the
rice
terraces
were
devastated
and
starvation
threatened
The
ash
fall
also
blocked
rivers
but
the
dams
it
formed
could
not
retain
the
waters
for
long
When
they
broke
torrents
of
mud
and
rock
tore
down
the
valleys
and
through
the
villages
and
towns
along
the
river
banks
The
official
death
toll
of
1,600
was
wild
underestimate
The
sky
went
black
even
over
southern
Bali
although
Denpasar
received
only
sprinkling
of
ash

group
of

conspirators

claimed
they
acted
to
prevent

kidnapped
and
killed
six
army
generals
In
the
following
days
General
Suharto
one
of
the
most
senior
surviving
commanders
isolated
the
conspirators
and
effectively
seized
power
The
blame
for
the
killings
was
pinned
on
the
Communist
Party
the
PKI
which
denied
any
involvement
pogrom
was
then
unleashed
first
in
Java
and
next
in
Bali
with
widespread
killings
of
suspected
Communists
The
Chinese
minority
mainly
shopkeepers
moneylenders
and
other
small
businesspeople
were
also
target
In
common
with
the
other
immigrant
groups
they
had
been
compelled
by
law
to
display
the
flag
of
their
country
of
origin
even
if
century
had
passed
since
their
ancestors
had
come
to
Indonesia
Throughout
Indonesia
every
Chinese
business
marked
by
the
flag
of
China
and
associated
in
peopleâs
minds
with
communism
was
attacked
The
numbers
killed
will
never
be
known:
in
Bali
alone
the
total
casualties
may
have
exceeded
60,000
Sukarnoâs
association
with
the
PKI
led
to
his
being
forced
to
yield
most
of
his
powers
Only
his
honored
role
in
the
independence
struggle
saved
him
from
trial
In
1968
Suharto
took
over
the
presidency
Growth
and
Modernization
In
the
decades
following
the
economy
stabilized
as
growing
oil

fueled
expansion
The
Chinese
community
backbone
of
the
nationâs
economy
carefully
rebuilt
its
commercial
interests
this
time
much
less
visibly
Tourism
to
Bali
was
seen
as
money-spinner:
the
1970s
saw
rapid
increase
in
the
numbers
of
foreign
visitors
During
the
1980s
the
authorities
decided
to
develop
more
up-market
tourism
on
Bali
Nusa
Dua
was
designated
to
become
huge
tourist
enclave
where
only
large
luxury
hotels
would
be
built
To
bring
the
necessary
volume
of
visitor
traffic
to
fill
all
the
new
rooms
Denpasar
Airportâs
runway
was
extended

During
the
next
decade
Bali
became
one
of
the
most
prosperous
places
in
the
country
In
order
to
help
Balinese
better
prepare
for
new
jobs
in
the

market
English
language
courses
became

The
late
1990s
were
period
of
disillusionment
with
the
long-lived
Suharto
regimeâs
many
failings
and
widespread
corruption
As
the
Indonesian
economy
faltered
ethnic
conflicts
erupted
in
many
parts
of
the
country;
even
Lombok
experienced
brief
flare-up
of
violence
against
Christians
and
ethnic

But
Bali
with
its
unique
Hindu
culture
and
its

has
remained
an
island

Athens
and
The
Athenians
ention
the
name
Athens
and
almost
everyone
will
have
some
preconceived
ideas
about
the
city
Socrates
painted
picture
with
words
in
the
fourth
century
b.c.
Pausanais
during
the
Roman
era
In
the
20th
century
Hollywood
added
its
own
slant
to
the
legends
and
every
school
child
learns
about
the
gods
of
the
ancient
Greek
worldÂ âÂ of
Zeus
Athena
and
Apollo
The
most
important
city
in
the
world
during
its
heyday
in
the
fifth
and
fourth
centuries
b.c.
the
people
of
Athens
were
highly
sophisticated
in
their
thoughts
and
actions
their
tastes
and
fashions
This
small
city
set
on
and
around
dramatic
hill
of
rockÂ âÂ the
AcropolisÂ âÂ became
the
cradle
of
western
civilization
From
the
public
meetings
held
here
the
concepts
of
citizenship
democracy
and
debate
developed
Through
their
regard
for
learning
history
and
science
were
first
codified
and
organized
The
Athenian
love
of
leisure
allowed
the
development
of
numerous
pursuits
such
as
theaterâââimagine
world
without
tragedy
or
comedy
(without
the
ancient
Athenians
the
much-loved
TV
soap
opera
might
never
have
been
possible)
They
also
admired
sporting
prowess
inaugurating
the
Olympic
Games
where
the
best
in
the
world
would
compete
together
simply
for
the
glory
of
winning
Athenians
left
an
enduring
legacy
of
concepts
and
ideas
for
humankind
but
they
also
bequeathed
remarkable
number
of
buildings
and
artifacts
that
tell
us
about
their
lives
The
remains
of
the
temples
of
the
Acropolis
are
recognized
worldwide
and
hundreds
of
statues
along
with
ordinary
household
pottery
jewelry
and
tools
hold
fascination
for
anyone
who
enjoys
exploring
the
past
However
the
city
of
Athens
is
more
than
sum
of
these
ancient
parts
Though
it
disappeared
from
the
record
books
following
the
decline
of
the
Roman
Empire
in
the
fifth
centuryÂ âÂ its
lineage
and
magnificent
monuments
unappreciatedÂ âÂ it
has
risen
like
phoenix
from
the
ashes
since
1834
the
year
that
it
became
capital
of
the
modern
country
of
Greece
Grand
buildings
were
erected
to
mark
its
re-birth
Though
Neo-Classical
design
was
fashionable
everywhere
in
Europe
in
the
mid-19th
century
in
Athens
it
echoed
that
of
the
original
monuments
of
the
ancient
cityÂ âÂ it
was
in
sense
returning
home
The
elegant
simplicity
of
the
Parliament
building
graceful
faÃ§ade
of
the
University
and
almost
âRococo-esqueâ
decoration
on
the
Academy
all
hark
back
to
ancient
antecedents
Each
was
built
with
marble
hewn
from
the
Pentelic
Hills
just
as
those
erected
in
Athens
at
the
time
of
Socrates
But
there
was
downside
to
this
sudden
re-emergence
to
center
stage
People
were
drawn
to
the
new
capital
like
bees
to
honey-pot
and
throughout
the
19th
century
the
dispossessed
of
the
economically
floundering
Aegean
islands
flocked
here
to
find
work
In
the
1920s
in
the
aftermath
of
WWII
and
the
fall
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
Greece
and
Turkey
agreed
on
mass
population
swap
and
millions
of
Greeks
whose
families
had
lived
in
Asia
Minor
(on
the
western
Turkish
coast)
for
generations
found
themselves
homeless
in
their
spiritual
homeland
Athens
strained
to
accommodate
many
of
them
and
rash
of
building
work
saw
the
erection
of
the
first
faceless
utilitarian
suburbs
that
now
surround
the
downtown
area
Since
buildings
were
kept
low-rise
in
an
attempt
to
make
them
earthquake
proof
Athens
began
to
spread
outwards
across
the
olive
groves
of
nearby
valleys
Not
one
of
the
worldâs
prettiest
cities
its
preponderance
for
concrete
can
give
it
drab
and
shabby
look
even
on
the
brightest
of
days
In
the
latter
years
of
the
20th
century
very
little
was
done
to
improve
matters
The
population
grew
but
the
infrastructure
was
not
developed
resulting
in
gridlock
of
the
urban
traffic
system
smog
and
noise
pollution
Today
at
first
glance
nothing
seems
to
have
changed
brown
layer
of
pollution
hangs
over
the
city
in
both
hot
and
cold
weather;
the
seemingly
endless
hooting
of
horns
down
the
wide
boulevards
and
the
drone
of
vehicles
making
painfully
slow
progress
through
the
narrow
streets
raises
noise
levels;
and
in
city
with
so
many
apartments
and
so
little
parking
itâs
no
surprise
that
sidewalks
become
places
to
leave
your
vehicle
and
pedestrians
must
risk
life
and
limb
by
walking
on
the
roads
Perhaps
this
picture
seems
little
bleak
but
there
is
one
positive
factor
that
eases
the
concern
about
visiting
Athens
Itâs
so
easy
to
escape
the
city
completely
that
one
neednât
feel
trapped
by
the
urban
environment
Within
an
hour
of
being
at
Syntagma
Square
outside
the
National
Parliament
building
(the
symbolic
heart
of
the
city)
you
could
easily
be
sitting
at
the
quayside
of
some
small
Greek
island
having
cooling
drink
or
enjoying
the
pine
forest
of
the
countryside
of
AtticaÂ âÂ the
region
that
surrounds
the
capital
Athenians
understand
this
They
are
not
daunted
or
downhearted
by
their
surroundings
they
enjoy
their
city
revelling
in
the
opportunities
it
gives
them
Every
district
has
its
own
small
squares
with
cafÃ©s
where
people
gather
for
drink
or
mealÂ âÂ and
Athenians
love
to
eat
out
Youâll
be
surprised
at
the
wealth
of
good
restaurants
offering
international
cuisine
and
how
much
post-modernist
dÃ©cor
influences
interior
design
in
the
smarter
districts
Of
course
the
Greek
taverna
hasnât
become
extinct
Locals
as
much
as
visitors
enjoy
the
fresh
and
delicious
cuisine
thatâs
been
served
in
Greece
for
centuries
Greek
theater
is
thriving
at
new
auditoria
such
as
the
Megaron
complex
or
at
the
open-air
theaters
on
Lycabettus
Hill
The
annual
Athens
Festival
has
full
program
of
music
dance
and
poetry
with
rich
historical
legacy
Sports
are
still
avidly
followed
though
today
itâs
more
likely
to
be
football
not
discus
throw
that
excites
the
emotions
Powerboat
racing
out
on
the
waters
of
the
Saronic
Gulf
also
raises
the
adrenalin
of
the
wealthy
Tradition
still
plays
an
important
part
in
daily
life
here
The
family
forms
the
backbone
of
Greek
society
and
filial
ties
are
strong
Children
play
safely
in
the
streets
with
grandma
keeping
watchful
eye
New
babies
are
proudly
shown
to
the
world
in
the
evening
volta
or
stroll
when
neighbors
come
to
âbill
and
coo.â
Families
gather
for
weekend
meal
taking
over
corner
of
taverna
to
spend
couple
of
hours
in
noisy
debate
(some
may
say
argument)
while
perhaps
having
little
food
Eating
always
takes
second
place
to
conversation
at
Greek
meal
Greek
hospitality
is
warm
and
genuineÂ âÂ even
small
examples
such
as
always
being
welcomed
with
smile
and
shown
to
your
seats
at
taverna
Shopkeepers
are
skilled
salesmen
but
never
pushy
or
overbearing
The
Orthodox
ChurchÂ ââfor
so
long
the
one
thing
that
united
the
Hellenic
DiasporaââÂ still
has
strong
influence
on
the
population
Everyone
from
suited
businessmen
to
young
soldiers
on
national
service
make
regular
visit
to
Athens
Cathedral
or
small
local
church
to
light
candle
People
stop
in
on
the
way
home
from
work
or
in
their
lunch
breaks;
itâs
such
normal
part
of
everyday
life
here
The
Greek
language
also
unifiesâthe
congregation
with
the
clergy
and
Greeks
around
the
world
though
its
use
gives
the
capital
decidedly
exotic
air
as
visitors
struggle
to
make
sense
of
these
âforeignâ
letters
Thereâs
also
sense
of
patriotism
and
national
pride
here
even
among
the
youngÂ âÂ perhaps
brought
about
by
political
upheavals
in
the
late
20th
century
Since
Greek
democracy
was
restored
in
1975
after
the
military
dictatorship
it
is
as
though
the
population
relish
their
country
all
the
more
However
since
joining
the
European
Union
(then
the
Common
Market)
in
1981
Greece
has
definitely
moved
closer
to
her
western
cousins
being
one
of
the
first
wave
of
countries
to
join
the
Euro
currency
zone
The
government
in
Athens
has
done
well
out
of
her
union
receiving
billions
of
dollars
in
aid
which
has
been
used
to
upgrade
vital
road
links
throughout
the
country
Though
the
economy
is
still
troubled
you
are
just
as
likely
to
see
mobile
phones
as
worry
beads
in
manâs
hand
and
the
young
wear
the
latest
European
fashions
just
as
the
Italians
and
French
do
Tourism
also
continues
to
flourish
at
the
dawn
of
the
21st
century
It
is
Greeceâs
major
foreign
currency
earner
with
11
million
people
visiting
every
year
Athens
is
an
international
melting
pot
with
people
of
many
nationalities
treading
the
marble
steps
of
the
Acropolis
to
gaze
at
the
birthplace
of
Western
civilization
In
2004
the
Olympic
Games
first
held
in
Greece
during
ancient
times
will
return
to
the
capital
giving
Athens
the
chance
to
stand
in
the
limelight
again
The
city
offers
some
of
the
most
fascinating
and
alluring
archaeological
remains
in
the
world
yet
those
who
visit
in
the
21st
century
find
that
the
modern
city
works
hard
to
live
up
to
the
past
fi
(Dia)critic's
Corner
letter
writer
once
accused
The
[Toronto]
Globe
and
Mail
Canada's
newspaper
of
record
of
setting
new
record
for
splitting
an
infinitive
front-page
article
ended
in
the
phrase
Premier
Peterson
said
that
in
order

which
the

A16
the

was
indeed
completed
as
promised:

the

That
is
some
split!
However
writing
letters
to
editors
to
complain
about
split
infinitives
is
child's
play
for
the
truly
obsessed
As
self-confessed
obsessive
when
it
comes
to
newspapers'
errors
my
own
pet
peeveâone
which
all
the
North
American
news
services
and
most
of
its
major
news
magazines
seem
to
be
guilty
ofâis
leaving
diacritical
marks
off
foreign
words
To
their
credit
British
news
services
(e.g.
Reuters)
and
publications
like
the
Observer
Guardian
and
Economist
are
usually
quite
careful
to
get
it
right
Sometimes
these
omissions
are
genuinely
trivial
Montreal
is
quite
acceptable;
MontrÃ©al
would
be
pretentious
except
perhaps
in
Canada
But
sometimes
they
are
not
trivial
at
all
because
diacritical
mark
can
change
the
pronunciation
the
spelling
and
therefore
even
the
meaning
of
word
In
general
diacritical
marks
are
all
those
little
jots
and
tittles
that
appear
over
under
and
even
through
various
letters
We
don't
have
many
in
English;
the
only
common
one
can
think
of
offhand
is
the
diaeresis
(as
in
the
two
dots
over
naÃ¯ve
)
where
it
indicates
that
two
vowels
side
by
side
are
not
diphthong
but
separate
distinct
vowels
IsraÃ«l
is
an
example
which
is
not
seen
much
any
more;
ZaÃ¯re
is
seen
occasionally;
HaÃ¯ti
is
common
in
French
where
it
is
pronounced
as
three
syllables
but
the
English
standard
seems
to
be
Haiti
(two
syllables)
The
New
Yorker
still
insists
on
coÃ¶perate
Related
to
diacritical
marks
are
two
constructs
the
ligature
which
is
character
resulting
from
tying
together
two
or
more
standard
letters
and
the
digraph
which
is
special
case
of
the
ligature
The
term
ligature
is
usually
reserved
for
printer's
conventions
(that
is
where
combinations
like
fi
ffi
fl
and
ffl
are
linked
together
to
form
single
character)
whereas
the
digraph
while
graphically
tying
together
two
characters
actually
represents
two
diphthongs
which
were
common
in
Latin:
after
the
invention
of
printing
the
Latin/Romance
ae
became
Ã¦
and
oe
became
Å
These
are
almost
never
seen
in
the
US
today
but
they
are
still
occasionally
encountered
in
British
and
other
varieties
of
English
influenced
by
British
practice
although
it
is
usually
the
unligated
form
that
one
encounters
not
the
digraphs
The
most
common
example
used
to
be
US
encyclopedia
vs
traditional
non-US
encyclopaedia
(encyclopÃ¦dia
)
However
as
even
the
British
spell
this
word
the
US
way
now
the
best
examples
of
current
US/non-US
dichotomies
in
the
use
of
the
digraphs
can
be
gleaned
from
the
world
of
medicine
and
science
as
in
gynÅcology/gynecology
hÅmatology/hematology
Åsophagus/esophagus
Åstrogen/
estrogen
cÅsium/cesium
Ådema/edema
Åstrus/estrus
pÅdiatrics/pediatrics
In
Canada
one
rarely
encounters
in
common
usage
the
British
spellings
listed
but
while
they
continue
to
be
widely
used
by
medical
professionals
even
that
practice
has
come
under
US
influence
Diacritical
marks
can
be
broken
down
into
two
types:
accents
which
affect
roughly
speaking
pronunciation
only;
and
umlauts
which
affect
spelling
as
well
as
pronunciation
As
already
mentioned
English
is
relatively
sterile
when
it
comes
to
diacritical
marks;
true
gold
can
best
be
struck
in
foreign
fields
where
the
accent
grave
accent
aigu
and
the
circonflexe
The
two
accents
are
used
in
French
to
change
the
value
of
which
is
the
most
common
vowel
in
French
(as
in
English)
and
which
comes
in
as
many
varieties
as
Campbell's
soupâhence
the
need
for
some
kind
of
regulation
by
diacritical
marks
The
circonflexe
on
the
other
hand
is
really
sign
of
orthography
not
pronunciation
being
reminder
of
dropped
sâit
is
usually
there
for
historical
reasons
but
connoting
reason
which
has
long
since
ceased
to
make
sense
and
which
modern
French
speakers
have
probably
been
blithely
unaware
of
Thus
the
French
Ã®le
reminds
us
that
the
word
was
once
spelled
isle
from
Latin
insula;
the
name
of
the
eight
month
AoÃ»t
reminds
us
that
it
came
from
the
Latin
augustus;
and
Ãªtre
betrays
its
origins
as
Latin
esse
with
the
same
orthographical
scar
French
being
Latin-derived
language
is
also
very
rich
in
digraphs
which
are
often
still
retained
today
in
France
but
are
dying
out
in
Quebec:
cÅur
and
Åuvre
are
common
examples
German
has
no
pure
accents
that
can
think
of
(other
than
the
occasional
diaeresis
in
foreign
proper
nouns
such
as
IsraÃ«l
)
but
it
has
one
very
common
ligature
and
of
course
the
umlaut
which
is
much
like
digraphâin
fact
these
characters
are
essential
to
proper
spelling
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
dropped
umlaut
may
be
seen
as
an
offense
The
common
ligature
in
German
orthography
is
the
esszet
(Î²
Î²)
and
there
are
three
vowels
which
can
take
the
umlaut
(Ã¤
Ã¶
and
)
The
esszet
(pronounced
ess-tset)
was
formed
when
mediÃ¦val
(for
US
read
medieval)
humanists
got
carried
away
and
tried
to
force
German
into
the
GrÃ¦co-Latin
mould
of
grammar
and
spelling
(a
disease
that
spread
to
the
British
Isles
too)
In
Greek
the
sigma
that
is
written
in
the
middle
of
word
(Ï
called
medial
sigma)
is
different
from
the
sigma
at
the
end
of
word
(Ï
called
final
or
terminal
sigma)
In
mediÃ¦val
Latin
the
two
s's
were
also
differentiated:
was
the
medial
s
and
the
terminal
s
This
convention
persisted
until
recently
In
microfilms
of
the
1881
Canadian
census
have
come
across
names
like
Agneâ«s
who
was
sometimes
noted
as
being
dreâ«smaker
In
German
this
double-s
â«s
eventually
evolved
into
Î²
The
diphthongs
ae
oe
and
ue
appear
so
often
in
German
that
mediÃ¦val
scribes
started
writing
the
above
the
first
vowel
something
like
this:
\?\
As
they
were
writing
with
flat-pointed
pens
which
tended
to
emphasize
the
vertical
strokes
(especially
in
Fraktur
the
so-called
gothie
script
of
old
German)
the
little
superior
came
to
be
represented
by
two
short
vertical
strokes
which
then
became
two
square
dots
Then
when
Germany
adopted
Latin
letters
during
the
pre-World
War
II
era
they
became
two
round
dots
have
always
thought
that
the
was
perky
little
characterâdraw
circle
around
it
and
you
get
that
ubiquitous
Californianism
\?\
The
convention
in
English
is
to
transcribe
the
umlautâto
restore
as
it
were
the
lost
e
Hence
the
Hanseatic
port
of
LÃ¼beck
is
properly
Luebeck
in
English
Similarly
the
esszet
should
be
transcribed
as
ss
never
as
B
which
see
often
The
Scandinavian
languages
also
have
characters
similar
to
the
German
umlauts:
besides
the
and
(Swedish)
Norwegian
and
Danish
have
(a
as
in
English)
Norwegian
and
Danish
also
have
(o
e)
and
all
three
use
(a
a)
The
rules
for
transcription
are
similar
to
those
for
German
words:
Alborg=Aalborg;
KÎ¸benhavn=
Koebenhavn
(of
course
in
this
case
there's
perfectly
acceptable
English
equivalent
Copenhagen)
As
an
interesting
aside
German
alphabetizes
words
as
if
the
umlauts
were
transcribed
(so
KÃ¶ln
would
come
before
Kohl
for
instance)
but
the
Scandinavian
languages
treat
their
umlauts
as
trans-z
characters
(so
in
Swedish
phone
books
Ãdlund
would
come
after
ZetterstrÃ¶m)
News
services
that
drop
umlauts
might
deserve
some
sympathy;
given
the
isolation
of
North
Americans
the
assumption
is
easily
made
here
that
the
umlaut
is
an
extraneous
character
that
can
be
droppedâas
accents
in
French
often
are
when
French
words
are
transcribed
into
Englishâwithout
doing
bodily
harm
to
the
word
in
question
However
dropping
umlauts
is
less
forgivable
than
dropping
accents
because
accents
describe
pronunciation
and
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
the
word
will
know
how
it
is
supposed
to
be
pronounced
regardless
of
the
accent
If
you
have
heard
the
name
of
Canada's
prime
minister
(Jean
ChrÃ©tien)
pronounced
correctly
or
if
you
are
sufficiently
acquainted
with
French
to
know
this
fairly
common
name
(which
means
Christian)
you
do
not
need
to
know
that
an
acute
accent
is
usually
put
over
an
to
indicate
that
it
is
long
in
an
unstressed
syllable
Hence
its
omission
will
probably
not
stop
you
from
pronouncing
ChrÃ©tien
correctly
(that
is
with
the
emphasis
on
the
second
syllable)
Umlauts
are
not
simply
accents
however:
they
are
fundamental
to
the
spelling
of
word
and
should
always
be
transcribed
as
ae/oe/ue
(or
aa
in
the
case
of
the
Scandinavian
a)
in
character
sets
that
do
not
provide
umlauts
In
any
case
many
German
and
Scandinavian
place
names
have
English
equivalents:
Munich
for
MÃ¼nchen
Cologne
for
KÃ¶ln
the
aforementioned
Copenhagen
for
KÎ¸benhavn
Gothenburg
for
GÃ¶teborg
and
so
on
However
recently
read
an
Associated
Press
account
of
neo-Nazi
demonstration
in
place
called
Nurnberg
The
problem
here
is
that
this
is
neither
fish
nor
fowl
It
is
not
the
correct
English
name
for
this
city
which
is
Nuremberg
and
it
is
not
the
correct
German
name
which
is
NÃ¼rnberg
or
Nuernberg
One
strongly
suspects
that
the
writer
simply
did
not
know
the
English
name
for
NÃ¼rnberg
Yet
more
confirming
evidence
to
the
pessimists
amongst
us
who
lament
the
deterioriation
of
standards
by
the
users
and
abusers
of
the
Mother
Tongue
especially
cis-Atlantic

The

the

than

that

at
one
of
our
filials
instead
of

am
guilty
of
speaking
Quebec
English
In
Quebec
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
English
affects
French
One
hears
expressions
like
le
snack
bar
chequer
(instead
of
verifier
)
and
un
towing
tow
truck
In
the
business
world
one
encounters
myriad
of
Anglicisms
like
meeting
cash
flow
down-size
and
business
itself
The
presence
of
these
borrowings
make
some
Quebecois
feel
that
their
language
is
under
threat
More
and
more
however
the
flow
is
not
unidirectional:
most
English-speaking
monolingual
Quebecer
will
use
metro
for
subway
dÃ©panneur
for
convenience
store
and
caisse
populaire
instead
of
cooperative
bank
The
following
demonstrates
the
French
influence
on
Quebecois
English:
The
professor
(teacher)
at
the
polyvalent
(high
school)
believed
that
scholarity
(education)
was
being
affected
by
students
consecrating
(devoting)
more
time
to
manifestations
(demonstrations)
about
the
dress
code
than
to
their
notes
(grades)
During
his
conferences
(lectures)
their
inattention
was
hurting
their
apprenticeship
(learning
of
the
subject
matter)
He
also
felt
he
was
getting
collaboration
(cooperation)
from
his
confreres
Anglophone
(English
speakers)
Francophone
(French
speakers)
and
Allophone
(speakers
of
neither
English
nor
French)
in
better
serving
the
collectivity
(community)
He
thus
had
rendezvous
(meeting)
with
the
Director-General
(principal)
Monsieur
Gendron
and
stated
that
it
was
primordial
(essential)
consideration
that
some
teachers
be
let
go
before
they
reached
permanence
(tenure)
under
the
syndicate
(union)
agreement
Monsieur
Gendron
wrote
back
saying
that
he
had
requested
subvention
(grant)
in
the
annex
(appendix)
to
his
planification
(policy)
budget
to
the
confessional
(denominational)
school
board
in
order
that
formation
modalities
(training
methods)
could
be
created
to
make
teachers
more
dynamic
animators
(group
leaders)
Although
terms
like
collaboration
rendezvous
and
annex
might
be
used
in
non-Quebec
English
contexts
they
read
like
inappropriate
choices
from
synonym
dictionary
and
cooperation
meeting
and
appendix
seem
more
natural
The
trend
towards
the
Gallicization
of
English
in
Quebec
coincides
with
the
introduction
of
pro-French
legislation
around
twenty
years
ago
and
the
use
of
French
has
gained
in
prestige
as
result
making
it
more
likely
for
Gallic
loanwords
to
appear
in
English
Anglophones
are
speaking
French
to
greater
extent
at
home
and
at
work
creating
situation
in
which
the
French
term
becomes
more
familiar
than
the
English
Thus
an
Anglophone
might
use
the
word
demand
when
he
means
ask
reparations
when
he
means
repairs
and
remark
when
he
means
notice
because
he
is
constantly
employing
demander
rÃ©parations
and
remarquer
when
speaking
French
These
faux
amis
(false
friends)
as
they
are
called
are
confused
both
by
Anglophones
speaking
French
and
Francophones
speaking
English
They
are
also
among
many
of
the
words
likely
to
have
their
meanings
changed
in
Quebec
English
For
example
rÃ©sumer
does
not
mean
to
resume
but
as
Americans
know
from
their
adoption
of
rÃ©sumÃ©
for
curriculum
vitae
to
summarize;
and
decevoir
means
to
disappoint
not
to
deceive
Not
many
Anglophones
in
Quebec
today
use
resume
and
deceive
in
the
French
sense
but
over
time
suspect
that
such
usages
will
increase
It
is
often
hard
to
know
where
English
and
French
begin
and
end
Franglais
includes
such
classics
as

steamÃ©

music

is

Quebecers
To
those
who
bemoan
the
loss
of
the
chastity
of
the
French
language
all
can
say
is
that
the
lady
never
was
virgin:
French
is
essentially
mutated
Latin
corrupted
by
Arabic
Gaulish
and
Germanic
to
name
few
of
the
seducers
Even
the
name
of
the
country
France
owes
its
name
(as
does
England
to
Germanic
tribe
Language
purity
is
myth
The
reality
is
that
English
and
French
have
been
borrowing
from
one
another
since
at
least
1066
Ironically
some
of
the
dreaded
Anglicisms
like
rosbif
and
club
were
originally
Gallicisms
that
had
penetrated
English
in
the
18th
century
The
King
of
Wordsmiths
John
Updike
remarked
that
language
has
bloomed
from
the
infinite
fumblings
of
anonymous
men
We
meddle
constantly
with
our
linguistic
roots
grafing
suffixes
and
slang
with
equal
abandon
and
toss
the
resulting
hybrids
about
us
with
the
carelessness
of
toddlers
flinging
pablum
Thus
are
new
words
born
whether
as
engineer's
lingo
or
the
wino's
mutterings
But
new
language
blooms
also
from
the
not-so-careless
utterances
of
certain
individual
writers
particularly
in
the
field
of
speculative
fiction
At
least
since
Lewis
Carroll
intrigued
his
readers
with
Jabberwocky
there
have
been
writersâRobert
Heinlein
and
Dr
Seuss
to
name
twoâwho
deliberately
minted
new
words
In
Clockwork
Orange
Anthony
Burgess
invented
an
entire
dialect
(Nadsat
Russified
version
of
English):
could
sort
of
slooshy
myself
making
special
sort
of
shoms
and
govoreeting
slovos
like
Dear
dead
idlewilds
rot
not
in
variform
guises
and
all
that
cal
Frank
Herbert
was
also
no
slouch
at
wordvention:
chaumurky
sietch
and
heighliner
are
examples
from
Dune
Much
of
it
is
fresh
serviceable
language
not
merely
humdrum
technical
derivatives
or
the
names
of
gadgets
and
aliens
and
has
certifiable
potential
to
enter
the
English
language
Grok
for
example
But
for
sheer
variety
quantity
and
above
all
charm
of
his
neologisms
submit
that
none
compare
with
Jack
Vance
a.k.a
John
Holbrook
Vance
As
Jack
Rawlins
said
...to
make
up
words
that
carry
just
the
right
scent
that
strike
the
reader
as
new
and
familiar
simultaneously
is
extremely
challenging
and
Vance
is
master
at
it
It
is
not
unusual
for
single
novel
to
have
fifty
or
more
newly
created
words;
in
The
Face
there
are
almost
hundred
In

for

of
the

categories:
belp-horn
screedle

elf-pipe
tympany
guitar
dulciole
heptagong
zinfonella
In
Galactic
Effectuator
Vance
tosses
off
gangee
sprugge
cardenil
bush
raptap
and
shatterbone
in
two
orgiastic
paragraphs
Most
of
Vance's
neologisms
are
nouns
the
majority
of
them
plants
animals
and/or
foods
Others
designate
musical
instruments
or
weapons
denote
magical
spells
crystallize
cultural
concepts
or
rituals
or
express
metaphors
Some
like
skak
and
merrihew
are
footnoted
with
lengthy
explanations
about
the
sociology
of
magical
creatures
Terms
like
Monomantic
Syntoraxis
and
Tempofluxion
Dogma
reflect
his
droll
skepticism
toward
religion
Some
are
wonderfully
playful
such
as
pinky-panky-poo
or
simply
wonderful
such
as
scurch
and
dreuwhy
(the
latter
alleged
to
have
been
drawn
from
the
ancient
Welsh)
The
adjectives
are
always
vivid:
the
colors
rawn
and
pallow
and
smaudre
(which
also
function
as
nouns)
and
squalmaceous
or
halcositic
He
also
gives
us
verbs
(disturgle
skirkling)
few
articles
and
cardinal
numbers
and
even
sprinkling
of
interjections
and
appellatives
The
words
may
also
be
categorized
according
to
whether
they
are
intended
to
be
English
Clearly
most
of
them
are;
we
are
expected
to
read
them
without
recoiling
though
we
may
grope
for
dictionary
Others
are
implicitly
or
expressly
taken
from
an
imaginary
tongue
such
as
Paonese
or
the
idiom
of
the
Dirdir
or
that
of
the
Water-folk
(e.g.
the
shibbolethic
brga
skth
gz)
But
the
most
interesting
method
of
analyzing
Vance's
neologisms
is
by
etymological
speculation
which
falls
into
roughly
five
categories
that
shade
into
one
another
like
colors
in
the
spectrum
list
these
divisions
in
order
of
decreasing
distance
from
English:
1
Those
that
appear
to
have
come
into
the
world
de
novo
from
stem
to
suffix
We
can
think
of
no
corollary
and
feel
little
or
no
resonance
with
known
wordsâdyssac
(an
herb
liquor)
thawn
(a
bearded
cave-dweller)
bgrassik
(translation
uncertain)
2
Those
that
tantalize
us
with
faint
echoes
of
known
words
The
morphemes
are
rather
familiar
but
overall
we
cannot
place
them:
harquisade
(a
variety
of
tree
with
glass
foliage)
marathaxus
(a
scale
from
the
body
of
the
demon
Sadlark)
Some
of
these
are
..
hauntingly
familiar
growths
like
catafalque
trees
and
hangman
trees
as
Terry
Dowling
put
it
Submulgery
ensqualm
bifaulgulateâthe
reader
runs
to
the
dictionary
and
is
surprised
to
find
them
absent
Some
sound
so
real
that
they
flit
past
like
butterflies
or
called
strikes
only
to
awaken
us
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
the
realization
that
they
cannot
be:
halcoid
subuculate
Chief
Manciple
Close
cousins
of
such
words
float
unbidden
into
our
consciousness
We
think
of
subterfuge
and
skulduggery
to
explain
submulgery;
coaxed
by
ensqualm
we
recall
ensnare
qualm
and
squall;
for
bifaulgulate
ungulate
and
host
of
words
beginning
with
the
prefix
bi-
come
to
mind
We
are
crowded
with
conjecture
3
Portmanteau
words
the
most
fascinating
and
treacherous
Here
the
stems
are
reasonably
certain
but
they
ignite
an
extended
metaphor
Thasdrubal's
Laganetic
Transfer
was
the
spell
used
by
the
magician
Iucounu
to
banish
Cugel
on
his
search
for
the
euphoriant
cusps
in
The
Eyes
of
the
Overworld
One
might
easily
overlook
the
hidden
word
lagan
goods
thrown
into
the
sea
with
buoy
attached
This
is
certainly
reference
to
Firx
the
painful
parasite
installed
in
Cugel's
liver
to
keep
his
mind
on
his
task
Moreover
the
phrase
is
reminder
of
Vance's
love
of
sailing
Another
example
is
gleft
kind
of
phantom
one
of
which
stole
part
of
Guyal's
brain
while
his
mother
was
in
labor
Surely
this
word
arose
from
glia
class
of
brain
cells
and
theft
An
especially
intriguing
case
is
pleurmalion
the
tubeshaped
device
used
by
the
sorcerer
Rhialto
to
discern
the
location
of
precious
textual
prism
even
from
great
distances
in
space
and
time
We
cannot
avoid
recognition
of
the
Latin
pleura
side
or
rib
And
mustn't
the
-malion
fragment
refer
to
Pygmalion
the
legendary
king
who
fell
in
love
with
his
sculpture
of
woman
and
persuaded
Aphrodite
to
bring
it
to
life?
We
are
struck
by
the
insight
that
the
pleurmalion
relates
to
the
lost
prism
as
the
biblical
rib
to
woman
bringing
it
(her)
into
view
and
thus
to
hand
They
must
be
reunited
Any
doubts
that
Vance
actually
thinks
along
these
lines
are
dispelled
by
revealing
footnote
to
the
word
murst
in
Chapter
16
of
the
last
book
in
his
Demon
Prince
series:
The
meaning
of
this
word
like
others
in
The
Book
of
Dreams
[the
villain's
childhood
notebook
can
only
be
conjectured
(Must:
urgency?
With
verst:
in
Old
Russia
league?
Farfetched
but
who
knows?)
4
In
this
group
are
words
that
draw
clearly
from
identifiable
roots
and
appendages
and
combine
them
according
to
traditional
rules:
calligynics
malepsy
Gynodyne
photochrometz
These
are
mix-'n'-match
suits
of
clothes
The
Latin
Greek
or
Old
English
roots
are
readily
discernible
(though
cannot
explain
the
-etz
in
the
last
case)
and
generate
few
if
any
metaphorical
overtones
5
Compounds
straightforward
alloys
of
real
words
sturdily
welded
or
hyphenated:
sagmaw
trapperfish
sadapple
bumbuster
and
the
delightfully
macabre
ghostclutch
He
has
even
been
known
to
do
this
in
French:
garde-nez
nose-protector
is
logical
amalgam
of
garder
to
guard
and
pince-nez:
An
extravagant
garde-nez
of
gold
filigree
clung
to
the
ridge
of
his
nose
Such
compounds
can
seduce
us
into
spurious
assumptions
The
term
elving-platformâa
birthing
station
for
the
species
hyrcan
majorâimplies
the
existence
of
the
verb
to
elve
give
birth
to
an
elf!
Vance
can
indeed
be
master
of
the
ridiculous
(Meanwhile
we
should
not
overlook
that
hyrcan
major
is
also
fine
portmanteau
word
with
its
references
to
Hyrcania
province
of
the
ancient
Persian
and
Parthian
empires
and
Ursa
Major
the
Great
Bear
constellation.)
Even
some
of
Vance's
proper
nouns
hint
strongly
at
the
existence
of
daily
words:
Universal
Pancomium
the
name
of
large
boat
suggests
more
generalized
category
of
encomium;
reading
Dylas
Extranuator

spaceship)
compels
us
to
ask
what
extranuate
might
meanâperhaps
strain
in
wonder?

the
Catademnon

is
certainly
not
merely
confection
reminding
us
as
it
does
of
condemn
Agamenmon
and
Parthenon
all
of
which
relate
directly
to
Vance's
hero
Emphyrio
and
his
tragic
fate
Vance
has
achieved
something
extraordinary:
the
invention
of
nearly
1700
interesting
new
words
number
sufficient
to
justify
his
own
dictionary
In
contrast
the
Burroughs
Dictionary
and
The
Dune
Encyclopedia
include
many
characters
and
places
and
are
thus
actually
concordances
or
encyclopedias
rather
than
true
dictionaries
And
Vance
is
still
busily
incorrigibly
at
work
Most
neologisms
remain
in
their
literary
greenhouses
to
be
enjoyed
only
by
visitors
But
some
have
escaped
and
spread
like
weeds
to
become
part
of
the
language:
Heinlein's
grok
for
example
How
many
of
Vance's
coinings
will
infiltrate
our
daily
gab?
Will
we
send
our
enemies
skirkling
or
drink
skull-busters
at
the
corner
bar?
Will
our
windows
be
made
of
translux?
In
The
Languages
of
Pao
Vance
explored
the
notion
of
using
created
languages
as
instruments
of
social
engineering
Let
us
hope
that
his
whimsical
wordsâWhimsicantâare
already
doing
just
that

The
Problem
of
Names
Recently
brisk
chummy
young
woman
whom
had
just
met
asked
me
what
my
first
name
is
John
told
her
Well
now
John...,she
began
Nobody
calls
me
John
said
gently
then
explained
to
her
that
it
is
not
so
much
the
first-naming
itself
that
some
of
us
older
citizens
do
not
like
but
the
doing
it
in
casual
way
by
people
we
do
not
know
told
her
that
people
who
know
me
call
me
Jock
have
carried
that
label
from
the
first
week
of
my
life
was
born
in
Winnipeg
General
Hospital
My
mother
was
Canadian
by
birth;
my
father
an
immigrant
from
Scotland
Nurses
in
the
hospital
teased
him
about
his
accent
and
began
referring
to
me
as
wee
Jock
My
mother's
relatives
picked
it
up
and
have
lived
with
it
ever
since
When
was
in
high
school
some
of
my
friends
took
delight
in
referring
to
me
as
an
athletic
supporter
(I
like
the
woman
in
Peter
De
Vries'
novel
Forever
Panting
who
spoke
about
John

Dr
Wayne
W

one
of
the
better-selling
gurus
in

few
years

gave
this
advice
in

book
Pulling

Strings:
Always
deal
with
people
on

name
basis
unless
they
make
it
clear
that
they
need
to
be
addressed
in
some
other
way

did

use
the
word

with
respect
to
those
of
us
who
prefer
not

called
by
our
first
names

people
who
do

know
us
at
all
well?

ANTIPODEAN
ENGLISH
Dharuk
Words
In
English
When
the
first
European
settlers
arrived
in
Australia
in
1788
there
were
approximately
250
separate
languages
spoken
by
the
indigenous
peoples
During
the
200
years
of
European
occupation
these
have
declined
in
use
to
the
point
where
not
more
than
about
twenty
are
active
in
the
sense
that
they
are
being
learnt
by
Aboriginal
children
and
cover
aspects
of
the
everyday
life
experienced
by
those
children
These
active
languages
tend
to
be
those
spoken
in
the
north
and
the
west
of
Australia
in
those
parts
of
the
country
where
the
Aborigines
have
been
most
able
to
retain
their
traditional
way
of
life
The
first
languages
that
the
Europeans
encountered
those
once
spoken
on
the
east
coast
of
Australia
survive
only
as
they
were
recorded
by
the
settlers
and
have
been
reconstructed
in
the
light
of
later
acquired
knowledge
of
the
family
of
Aboriginal
languages
as
whole
Paradoxically
it
is
these
languages
that
have
contributed
most
to
the
lexicon
of
Australian
English
Not
more
than
about
400
words
have
been
borrowed
altogether
and
yet
of
these
some
60
come
from
Dharuk
the
language
which
was
spoken
on
the
site
now
occupied
by
the
city
of
Sydney
and
not
much
beyond
it
which
existed
in
an
inland
and
coastal
dialect
Although
there
are
still
few
Dharuk
descendants
in
the
vicinity
of
Sydney
and
these
may
still
use
handful
of
Dharuk
words
Dharuk
effectively
ceased
to
function
as
language
by
the
mid-19th
century
What
then
survives?
Names
of
flora
and
fauna
names
of
implements
especially
weapons
few
miscellaneous
names
of
dwellings
ceremonies
people
identified
by
sex
or
activity
striking
features
of
the
environment
and
handful
of
pidgin
terms
suggestive
of
an
only
rudimentary
communicative
exchange
The
flora
and
fauna
are
characterised
by
their
distinctiveness
The
Great
South
Land
was
to
prove
extraordinarily
rich
in
new
species
some
of
which
like
the
kangaroo
had
an
irresistible
novelty
about
them;
at
the
same
time
they
were
as
numerous
as
sheep
in
England
and
as
useful
to
man
The
wallaby
and
the
wallaroo
were
like
the
kangaroo
large
marsupials
which
the
Aborigines
hunted;
the
koala
was
also
marsupial
but
arboreal
in
habit
and
sufficiently
unique
in
appearance
to
have
had
the
settlers
liken
it
to
bear
sloth
or
monkey
in
their
naming
of
it;
the
wombat
was
heavy
thickset
marsupial
sometimes
known
as
badger
because
of
its
burrowing
habit
The
only
animal
immediately
recognisable
to
European
eyes
was
the
native
dog
or
dingo
and
the
distinction
was
early
made
between
the
domesticated
dog
or
dingo
and
the
wild
dog
or
warrigal
Two
of
the
small
number
of
birds
identified
were
the
boobook
an
omnipresent
owl
and
the
currawong
large
crowlike
bird
whose
curiosity
would
have
brought
it
to
notice
The
name
of
good
eating
fish
the
wollami
or
snapper
on
which
the
early
settlers
were
frequently
dependent
was
again
an
understandable
borrowing
When
it
came
to
plants
the
same
sort
of
criteria
were
observed:
the
waratah
strikingly
beautiful
red
flower
which
has
become
the
floral
emblem
of
New
South
Wales
was
soon
identified
as
were
the
burrawang
palmlike
plant
very
common
in
the
coastal
forests
and
the
kurrajong
plant
that
yields
useful
fibre
The
name
of
the
dance
ceremony
corroboree
probably
the
most
immediately
observable
characteristic
of
peoples
regarded
as
savages
which
had
both
religious
and
an
informal
social
form
was
readily
adopted
as
was
koradji
wise
elder
or
as
he
was
often
described
witch
doctor
Weapons
like
the
boomerang
the
hielamon
(a
wooden
shield)
the
nulla
nulla
(a
club)
the
waddy
(ditto)
and
the
woomera
(a
spear-thrower)
were
identifiable
to
the
earliest
settlers
as
were
also
gin
woman
myall
which
distinguished
wild
Aborigine
from
his
civilised
or
tame
brother
gibber
stone
and
gunyah
dwelling
But
the
largest
group
of
words
that
characterise
the
early
period
are
those
that
clearly
formed
part
of
language
used
for
the
limited
communication
that
took
place
between
the
two
peoples:
cobra
head
mundowie
foot
bogie
to
bathe
or
bathing
place
crammer
to
steal
nangry
to
sleep
patter
to
eat
budgeree
good
cabon
big
cooler
angry
jerron
afraid
narangy
little
muny
very
baal
negative
and
cooee
call
or
to
call
Of
the
several
word
lists
compiled
by
officers
of
the
First
Fleet
as
the
first
group
of
convict-laden
ships
was
known
that
of
Lieut
William
Dawes
is
the
most
ambitious
attempting
grammar
of
Dharuk
as
well
as
vocabulary
But
such
resource
is
more
an
indication
of
what
was
available
to
the
settlers
than
record
of
what
they
actually
used
For
that
we
must
turn
to
their
accounts
of
life
in
the
colony
and
to
the
words
which
they
adopted
which
they
use
more
or
less
unselfconsciously
as
part
of
their
language
as
colonists
And
here
there
are
three
observations
to
be
made
First
the
words
used
by
the
Aborigines
were
seldom
as
attractive
to
the
colonists
as
descriptive
English
names
that
emphasised
the
perceived
resemblance
between
the
new
and
the
known
and
familiar
and
so
made
for
more
certain
communication
Thus
distinguishing
epithets
like
colonial
native
wild
black
brown
green
and
gray
qualify
names
of
common
Old
World
species
like
apple
ash
oak
and
pine
to
build
considerable
and
understandable
vocabulary
Second
positive
effort
needed
to
be
made
to
ascertain
the
Aboriginal
name
and
experience
showed
that
the
geographical
range
of
Dharuk
was
extremely
limited:
the
fact
that
new
set
of
names
came
into
use
as
one
crossed
the
boundary
of
another
Aboriginal
language
must
have
mitigated
against
borrowing
Third
the
Aborigines
were
widely
thought
of
as
backward
and
uncivilised
and
while
this
attitude
persisted
their
nomenclature
carried
no
great
recommendation

Nouns
Could
the
thoughts
of

to

nouns
that
apply
to
their
circumstances?

Cyberspace
and
Khyber
Pass
The
language
of
the
information
superhighway
is
Englishâmore
accurately
sub-species
thereof
with
its
own
grammar
and
semantics
Since
it
has
come
into
being
with
sudden
and
persistent
rush
reflecting
the
burgeoning
and
undisciplined
information
system
it
conveys,
it
has
not
been
amply
recorded
much
less
described
in
standard
reference
works
or
lexicons
The
New
Shorter
Oxford
English
Dictionary
(1993)
and
reprinted
with
corrections
in
the
same
year
does
not
even
include
internet
To
fill
the
gap
specialized
glossaries
have
emerged
the
best
naturally
in
computerized
form
(like
The
Jargon
File
Version
2.9.6
16
August
1991)
where
entries
can
be
quickly
and
efficiently
updated
process
which
in
itself
reflects
the
hasty
transience
of
much
of
the
vocabulary
Although
complete
linguistic
description
will
have
to
wait
until
the
dust
settlesâif
it
does
at
all
given
the
volatility
of
the
technology
and
the
ever-increasing
number
of
the
participants-certain
features
destined
to
remain
are
already
apparent
As
far
as
grammar
is
concerned
the
simplistic
syntax
and
the
exceptional
preponderance
of
nouns
and
verbs
(with
an
accompanying
heavy
reliance
on
conversion)
are
obvious
and
enduring
The
vocabulary
like
the
grammar
is
determined
to
large
extent
by
the
medium
of
computers
and
the
operation
of
networking
But
their
insistence
on
speed
is
not
entirely
the
message
Nor
would
it
be
correct
simply
to
draw
comparisons
with
newspeak
or
some
other
centrally
decreed
and
regulated
system
For
although
the
vocabulary
does
make
important
use
of
computer
terminology
and
although
it
does
share
with
newspeak
penchant
for
blends
and
acronyms
and
an
avoidance
of
adjectives
and
adverbs
it
reflects
manner
and
an
environment
greater
than
both
computerese
and
newspeak
Within
strictly
controlled
computer
system
in
which
accuracy
is
absolute
the
vocabulary
as
whole
is
programmatically
casual
Its
salient
characteristic
is
its
playful
primitivism
It
is
laid
back:

chats
browses
Stress
(evident
in
terms
like

as
well
as

by)
variety

The
iconic
word
is

sociolinguistic
cornucopia
of
connotations
of
sport
vigor
youth
individuality
speed
independence
leisure
health
and
middle-to-upper-class
education
and
affluence
The
vocabulary
is
jocular
in
its
easy
mixture
of
the
casual
(in
slang
or
coinages
or
abbreviations)
the
learned
(in
avatar
baroque
catatonic
synchronous
)
the
visual
(in
hieroglyphics
or
emoticons)
and
even
the
aural
(in
the
fondness
for
explosives
like
bang
common
spoken
name
for

or
onomatopoeia
bletch
glitch
gonk

The
vocabulary
is
suffisant

its

in
the
nonchalance
of
its
central
and
mixed
metaphor:
surfing
the
web
borrowed
from
scanning
television
channels
for
watchable
program
The
vocabulary
is
mischievous
in
the
mixtureâand
not
just
in
the
ways
just
mentioned
One
prominent
phenomenon
is
the
flaunting
use
of
homographs:
words
that
appear
in
conventional
dictionaries
are
given
meaning
which
is
not
to
be
derived
logically
or
figuratively
from
the
customary
one
Leaving
aside
blends
and
acronyms
few
representative

you
It
may
be
argued
that
such
personal
semantics
are
more
than
mischievous
But
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
assert
that
they
are
critical
of
existing
structures
Jargon
or
slang
and
standard
have
always
coexisted
and
over
the
years
have
grown
more
mutually
tolerant
What
is
clear
in
any
case
is
that
private
and
exclusive
language
is
evolving
and
engaging
ever
larger
numbers
of
participants
in
linguistic
process
which
is
destined
to
become
more
and
more
public
as
computer
technology
itself
becomes
the
dominant
force
in
communication
and
other
social
activities
From
the
point
of
view
of
language
what
is
interesting
is
the
coincidence
be
it
mischievous
or
critical
or
accidental
of
the
ideal
and
the
real
For
the
examples
of
semantic
noncomplianceâalong
with

were

to
see
me
emerging
from

laughing
roundly
couple
of
minutes
later
hastily
told
them
what
it
said
on
the
towel:

This
is
an
example
of
what
Western
advertising
agencies
in

English
In
Japan
particularly
manufacturers
feel
that
English-sounding
names
and
writing

add
prestige
to
goods
marketed
there
and
it
is
certainly
true
that

has

has

as

But
let
us
return
to
for
moment
The
Sun
Was
Shining
and
the
Dude's
Family
Went
on
Picnic
It
turned
out
this
towel
had
been
made
in
Thailand
As
is
already
well
established
the
Japanese
are
the
undisputed
masters
of
putting
largely
meaningless
English
on
their
products
Here
however
was
an
example
of
Thai
efforts
in
the
same
direction
and
as
long-term
resident
here
am
pleased
to
note
that
it
is
grammatically
irreproachable
and
makes
some
sort
of
sense!
My
hosts
had
one
other
towel
in
the
same
series
which
they
eagerly
dug
out;
it
read:
In
the
Evening
the
Sheep

Praying

the
Twinkling
Stars
in
the
Dark
Sky
plucked
disconsolately

Not
at
all
contemporary
maybe
it
wasn't
the
simple-minded
nonsense
it
seemed
maybe
parody
of
Wordsworth
perpetrated
by
disillusioned
towel
copy
writer
la
J.K
Stephens'
celebrated
parody
of
that
poet:
Two
Voices
are
there:
One
is
of
the
deep/And
one
is
of
an
old
half-witted
sheep...
But
in
the
end
decided
it
was
the
simple-minded
nonsense
it
seemed
work
with
many
Japanese
in
Thailand
often
outside
office
hours
in
their

So
intrigued
by
the

furtively
began
to

their

(all
of
which
it
turned
out
had
been
bought
in

In
four
weeks
came
across
the

THE

Here
meaning

grammar
cannot
be
faulted
(except
for
PAPP
BABY:
PAP
BABY
would
be
intelligible
if
oddâ
lactation

though
with
regard
to
clothing
few
countries
can
be
said
to
conform
to
the
extent
Japan
does
The
salariman's
uniform
is
well
known
and
all
Japanese
schoolgirls
must
wear
blouses
modelled
on
those
of
Portuguese
mariners
from
the
days
of
sail
Some
have
said
that
the
Japanese
even
conform
in
rebellion:
the
Yakuza
(Japanese
Mafia)
all
dress
alike
though
little
sharper
e.g
two-colour
ties
mean
pairs
of
wraparounds
tattoos
brutal
crew
cuts
and
an
attitude!
Next
up
on
the
catwalk
is
young

How

The
most
important
contribution
to
comparative
linguistics
was
made
by
Sir
William
Jones
(1746-94)
British
linguist
trained
in
the
law
who
was
appointed
judge
of
the
supreme
court
of
judicature
at
Calcutta
in
1783
Convinced
of
the
importance
of
consulting
Hindu
legal
authorities
in
the
original
Encyc
Brit
1963
13
140a]
Jones
well
versed
in
Sanskrit
became
aware
of
the
correspondences
among
Sanskrit
Greek
Latin
Slavic
and
Germanic
forms
which
led
him
to
the
conclusion
that
Sanskrit
was
another
older
form
of
parent
language
from
which
all
had
sprung
It
was
his
work
that
formed
the
basis
of
the
linguistic
studies
later
carried
on
by
the
brothers
Grimm
(Jakob
Ludwig
Karl
1785-1863;
Wilhelm
Karl
1786-1859)
which
in
turn
gave
foundation
to
the
development
of
the
comparative
method
The
term
Indo-European
cropped
up
first
at
the
beginning
of
the
19th
century;
as
much
of
the
work
was
being
done
in
Germany
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
term
preferred
there
was
Indo-Germanic
actually
translation
of
indogermanisch
(with
small
because
it
is
an
adjective)
which
arose
in
the
late
1820s;
the
latter
survives
in
the
literature
largely
replaced
by
the
former
especially
since
the
discovery
that
Celtic
is
member
of
the
family
The
reason
for
bringing
up
this
bit
of
history
is
to
introduce
four
terms
with
which
some
readers
may
be
unfamiliar
and
which
reflect
to
some
small
degree
the
poetry
that
once
lurked
in
the
hearts
of
linguists
educated
in
literature
as
well
as
linguistics
The
first
is
karmadharÄya
Sanskrit
compound
of
karma
fate
destiny
dharÄya
holding
bearing
which
is
used
to
describe
compound
word
in
which
the
first
member
describes
the
second
as
in
highway
blackbird
(adj
n.)
steamboat
bonehead
fingerstall
fingernail
toenail
(attrib
n
n.)
The
second
is
dvandva
Sanskrit
redundant
compound
of
dva
dva
pair
couple
which
is
used
to
describe
compounds
in
which
the
elements
are
linked
as
if
joined
by
copula
as
in
prince-consort
attorney-general
postmaster-general
(n
n.)
bittersweet
(adj
adj.)
The
third
is
bahuvrihi
Sanskrit
compound
meaning
having
much
rice,<bahÃº
much
vrÄ«hiacute;
rice
It
is
used
to
describe
compounds
composed
of
an
adjective
and
substantive
so
as
to
form
principally
possessive
adjective
like
bahuvrihi
itself;
it
also
forms
compound
that
is
different
grammatically
from
its
head
member
and
particularly
plurals
that
function
as
singular
nouns
as
in
lazy-bones
sly-boots
Other
examples
are
rosy-fingered
redcoat
high-potency
(vitamin)
and
indeed
all
such
compounds
that
might
be
spelled
as
two
words
in
predicative
position
but
are
usually
written
with
hyphen
when
in
attributive
position
The
fourth
is
tatpurusha
literally
his
servant
which
is
used
to
describe
compounds
in
which
the
first
element
qualifies
or
determines
the
second
while
the
second
retains
its
grammatical
independence
as
noun
adjective
or
participle
For
example
bookcase
yearbook
summerhouse
windowbox
eyedoctor;
hair-raising
finger-licking
God-fearing
man-eating;
nose-picker
bottom-feeder
dive
bomber
fighter
escort
Whether
the
compound
is
written
conventionally
as
two
words
as
hypheme
or
solid
has
no
bearing
on
its
analysis
These
are
not
the
only
possibilities
for
compounding
in
English
(or
Hindi
or
Sanskrit)
but
they
are
the
most
common
Unbelievably
Part

The
Cassell
Dictionary
of
Appropriate
Adjectives
It
must
be
emphasized
that
this
is
not
synonym
dictionary;
rather
it
is
just
what
its
title
denotes:
dictionary
of
adjectives
that
are
appropriately
connected
with
the
nouns
that
are
listed
In
more
technical
sense
it
is
collection
of
collocative
adjectives
that
is
adjectives
that
are
often
associated
with
the
nouns
that
are
listed
For
example
here
is
the
listing
under
one
of
the
nouns:
appetite
appetites
mighty
enormous
gargantuan
endless
limitless
unlimited
unfailing
uncontrollable
lusty
voracious
ravenous
(in)
satiable
sharp
ferocious
rapacious
devouring
brutish
wolfish
healthy
hearty
greedy
keen
robust
inordinate
substantial
unbridled
avaricious
poor
grotesque
morbid
morose
raucous
finicky
discriminating,
(im)
moderate
shrunk
new-found
catholic
postprandial
Not
all
these
adjectives
seem
appropriate
to
me:
it
is
hard
for
me
to
envision
context
in
which
satiable
appetite
raucous
appetite
shrunk
appetite
or
postprandial
appetite
might
be
appropriate;
on
the
other
hand
I
like
many
readers
could
probably
come
up
with
several
other
adjectives
that
are
not
listed
Without
going
into
detail
on
each
one
of
these
the
difficulty
see
is
for
instance
with
raucous
appetite
for
raucous
means
harsh
strident
grating
and
is
commonly
associated
with
voice
where
indeed
it
is
listed
As
shrunk
is
past
and
past
participle
of
shrink
and
not
properly
an
adjective
am
not
sure
why
it
is
there
in
place
of
shrunken
especially
since
Mikhail
specifically
writes
in
his
Preface
Only
words
listed
in
standard
language
dictionaries
as
adjectives
are
included
in
this
Dictionary
Thus
all
other
etymological
forms
as
participles
ending
in
ed
(rejected
offer)
or
ing
(playing
child)
are
excluded
As
for
postprandial
that
is
usually
applied
to
something
edible
or
drinkable
as
referring
to
something
that
comes
after
meal;
in
my
language
(and
culture)
postprandial
appetite
would
be
rare
collocution
Everyone
has
his
own
private
view
of
how
language
works
an
observation
seldom
offered
by
linguists
even
those
who
touch
on
the
subject
of
idiolect
That
this
book
is
highly
personal
becomes
evident
in
the
entry
immediately
following
that
for
appetite:
appetizer
appetizers
See
also
food
intriguing
exquisite
irresistible
tasty
cheesy
spicy
tangy
Here
one
might
yearn
for
some
punctuation:
surely
the
last
four
words
cannot
be
considered
alongside
the
first
three
Moreover
can
think
of
dozens
of
other
words
in
the
tasty
tangy
class
that
could
be
added
but
those
appear
in
the
very
long
entry
under
food
In
principle
like
the
idea
of
such
book
and
have
thought
about
doing
one
myself
But
the
almost
insurmountable
practical
considerations
reared
up
before
me
and
quickly
abandoned
the
idea
For
one
thing
entries
become
less
useful
the
longer
they
are
In
the
present
work
for
example
the
entry
for
appetite
runs
to
eleven
lines
which
is
reasonably
assimilable;
the
entry
for
approach
approaches
however
runs
to
thirty-nine
lines
life
lives
to
fifty-eight
eye
eyes
to
sixty-eight
Are
users
really
so
desperate
for
descriptive
adjectives
that
will
go
with
nouns
as
to
be
willing
to
wade
through
almost
two
hundred
terms?
rather
doubt
it
Then
there
is
the
question
Why
are
both
singular
and
plural
forms
shown
for
the
headwords?
Although
mention
is
made
of
the
fact
in
the
Preface
no
reason
is
given
and
one
might
assume
that
users
of
such
book
would
have
no
difficulty
in
assuming
that
the
plural
of
breadwinner
is
breadwinners
even
that
the
singular
of
teeth
is
tooth
chief
criticism
of
this
book
in
particular
is
that
the
adjectives
are
jumbled
together
in
no
discernible
order
or
as
mentioned
with
punctuation
between
(except
for
serial
comma)
Thus
under
architecture
we
find
strings
like
...(un)original
eccentric
plain
austere
mediocre
nondescript..
...civic
religious
pastel
mosaic
landscape
prehistoric..
and
it
is
not
till
we
get
to
the
end
where
dozen
styles
are
listed
that
there
is
any
sense
of
semantic
or
associative
grouping
This
shortcoming
can
be
seen
in
most
entries:
area
areas...affluent
rich
unique
crucial
key
prime
vital
sensitive
volatile
enjoyable
quiet..
artefact
artefacts
[sic]...impressive
authentic..
priceless
deathless...aboriginal
religious
cultural
eye
eyes...bluish
(china-)
blue
sea-blue
brunet
almond
(liquid-)
brown
ginger-brown..
From
the
spelling
artefact
honour
and
from
the
name
of
the
publisher
this
is
clearly
work
produced
in
Britain
Although
there
might
be
some
differences
between
British
and
American
English
one
is
sore
put
to
accept
their
extending
to
the
notion
that
speakers
of
British
English
regard
almond
as
color
for
eyes
rather
than
shape
This
collection
could
have
been
made
more
useful
and
more
usable
had
the
author
attempted
to
group
adjectives
within
an
entry
according
to
semantic
character
rather
than
just
dump
them
into
one
helter-skelter
list
without
separators
of
any
kind

Manual
of
Specialised
Lexicography:
The
Preparation
of
Specialised
Dictionaries
In
the
decades
during
which
have
been
involved
in
the
compilation
editing
revision
updating
adaptation
etc
of
dictionaries
have
always
considered
lexicography
an
art
That
is
not
to
say
that
technique
is
not
involved
merely
to
observe
that
some
dictionaries
are
better
than
others
because
their
editors
are
more
literate
imaginative
poetic
and
generally
possess
those
attributes
with
which
we
associate
art
rather
than
technique
or
mundane
craftsmanship
Such
dictionaries
too
succeed
because
they
establish
rapport
with
generations
of
users
It
goes
without
saying
that
most
of
those
drawn
to
lexicography
like
those
attracted
to
art
schools
exhibit
skills
more
likely
to
be
associated
with
craft
than
with
art;
these
days
far
too
few
of
those
who
work
on
dictionaries
have
thorough
grounding
in
literature
let
alone
the
various
specialties
within
linguisticsâgeneral
and
comparative
studies
classical
and
modern
foreign
language
study
phonetics
philology
etymology
to
say
nothing
of
lexicology
and
lexicography
The
results
are
seen
on
the
bookshelves
of
bookshops
throughout
the
world:
adequate
but
largely
pedestrian
bilingual
dictionaries
and
scattering
of
monolingual
works
that
have
been
resurrected
by
greedy
publishers
who
have
engaged
dryasdust
editors
to
update
out-dated
out-of-copyright
dictionaries
in
order
to
make
fast
buck
Lexicographic

notion
long
prevalent
in

and
other
social
sciences
that
if
you
can
give
problem
name
you
have
somehow
gone
long
way
toward
solving
it
This
book
which
consists
of
series
of
chapters
and
subchapters
was
written
by
committee
which
immediately
tells
the
reader
something
about
its
likely
consistency
and
continuity
It
is
true
that
the
principles
that
apply
to
specialized
dictionaries
are
not
the
same
as
those
that
apply
to
general
dictionaries
either
monolingual
or
bilingual
For
one
thing
the
user
of
specialized
dictionary
can
be
assumed
to
have
level
of
sophistication
that
includes
knowledge
of
and
some
understanding
of
what
goes
on
in
general
dictionaries
It
takes
the
editors
of
the
subject
book
several
pages
to
make
this
point
which
it
seems
to
me
is
rather
simple
Their
explanation
includes
Venn
diagrams
(which
notwithstanding
their
utility
thought
had
gone
out
of
fashion
few
decades
ago)
and
other
devices
It
is
hard
to
imagine
that
this
book
would
be
picked
up
by
anyone
but
lexicographer
or
someone
interested
enough
in
becoming
one
to
subject
himself
to
such
turgid
presentation;
in
the
event
one
might
assume
certain
level
of
familiarity
with
the
subject
Yet
the
treatment
is
reminiscent
of
Washington
Irving's
Knickerbocker
History
of
New
York
whichâfacetiously
at
leastâstarts
out
with
the
creation
of
the
world
If
one
doubts
the
turgidity
of
the
style
of
this
work
witness
the
following
which
merely
says
that
entries
in
dictionary
can
be
ordered
in
different
ways:
The
macrostructure
of
the
word
list
should
be
understood
as
the
arrangement
of
the
lemmata
occurring
in
the
word
list
Is
that
the

person
to
whom
you
would
want
to
give
the
responsibility
for
explaining
complex
or
unknown
terms
in

sentences

of

to
me
chiefly
in
his

[XXII

appeared
review
article
by
Dr
William
Brashear
of
the
Egyptian
Museum
in
Berlin
of
two
new
books
dealing
with
the
alphabet;
now
we
have
this
comprehensive
work
on
writing
systems
Interest
in
writing
systems
was
dormant
for
many
years:
some
thirty
years
ago
the
onlyâand
best-knownâ
scholar
working
with
alphabets
was
Dr
David
Diringer
The
spark
that
has
ignited
so
many
to
look
at
the
subject
is
difficult
to
identify:
perhaps
it
can
be
put
down
to
television
and
its
many
programs
dealing
with
archaeology
recent
program
on
the
Minoan
civilization
mentioned
that
Michael
Ventris
was
teenager
when
he
listened
to
lecture
by
Sir
Arthur
Evans
in
which
he
described
his
struggles
trying
to
translate
what
had
become
known
as
Linear
and
Linear
B
the
ancient
scripts
found
at
Knossos
and
elsewhere
in
Crete
Ventris
the
program
held
vowed
to
be
the
one
who
would
one
day
translate
the
script(s)
reflex
of
ambition
rarely
associated
with
teenagers
today
In
any
event
Ventris
did
finally
decode
Linear
B
but
died
(at
thirty-four)
before
arriving
at
translation
of
Linear
A
If
susceptible
teenagers
watched
that
program
perhaps
they
will
be
inspired
to
work
on
Linear
A
still
an
enigma
owing
largely
to
the
paucity
of
corpus
The
subject
of
writing
systems
was
considered
beyond
the
pale
by
structural
linguists
as
it
was
not
reflex
of
natural
utterance
but
secondary
representation
(Structural
linguists
do
not
like
to
deal
with
meaning
either
satisfied
that
the
meaning
of
word
is
the
sum
of
its
contextsâa
perfectly
valid
argument
if
one
allows
context
to
include
one's
mother
telling
an
infant
Here
darling
eat
another
spoon
of
applesauce
Unless
ostensive
objects
are
thus
pointed
to
and
identified
how
could
anyone
ever
learn
their
names?)
As
consequence
the
subject
was
infra
dig
for
serious
linguists
for
many
years
and
it
is
refreshing
to
see
it
brought
to
the
surface
again
The
impact
of
writing
on
language
cannot
be
denied:
in
English
the
conservatism
of
the
spelling
system
has
had
an
effect
on
the
preservation
of
linguistic
features
that
might
have
otherwise
faded;
in
all
languages
the
traditions
of
literature
(to
say
nothing
of
scripture
[sic]
have
profound
influence
as
the
fundamentalist
effect
bears
witness
To
ignore
or
scorn
writing
and
its
influences
is
struthious
and
unscholarly
and
this
emerging
crop
of
books
besides
their
attractive
graphicsâexcuse
the
punâ
are
welcome
The
relationships
between
linguistics
and
writing
are
emphasized
here
and
there
in
The
World's
Writing
Systems
by
the
short
essays
prepared
by
the
editors
and
contributors
that
punctuate
the
text
It
would
be
most
useful
to
provide
list
of
the
thirteen
parts
of
the
book:
Part

Part

Part

imprinting

Each
of
these
parts
introduced
by
contributor
or
one
of
the
editors
has
several
sections;
there
are
seventyfour
sections
in
all
and
each
of
those
in
turn
has
its
own
commentary
The
result
is
not
only
comprehensive
treatment
of
subject
by
an
authority
but
detailed
description
of
the
place
the
section
has
in
the
general
scheme
of
representing
ideas

squiggles
on

Not
only
are
(so-called)
standard

there
are

Welsh
in
Part
X
The
word
colophon
has
undergone
several
metamorphoses
since
its
earliest
appearance
in
the
17th
century:
it
originally
referred
to
the
inscription
at
the
end
of
book
identifying
its
basic
bibliographic
information
that
is
title
author
subject
publisher
date
and
place
of
publication
in
other
words
the
information
today
found
on
the
title
page
Presumably
because
it
sounded
like
fancy
bibliographic
term
it
was
adapted
in
the
20th
century
as
fancy
word
for
logotype
or
trade
mark
For
its
third
incarnation
we
can
cite
page
920
of
the
present
book
in
which
colophon
is
drawn
into
service
as
the
title
of
section
that
lists
all
the
typographic
fonts
employed
in
typesetting
the
book
That
is
useful
and
interesting
adjunct
and
we
must
assume
that
it
has
been
called
colophon
because
typography
has
been
subsumed
under
the
original
rubric
of
bibliographic
information
Although
it
is
not
documented
in
any
dictionary
that
checked
this
usage
is
familiar
to
me
as
referring
to
the
modest
comments
that
publishers
like
Alfred
A
Knopf
once
included
on
the
last
page
of
their

for
example

on

will
be

rewarded
by
this
valuable
book
The
writing
is
concise
and
specific
allowing
little
room
for
idle
chatter;
the
information
is
sometimes
revelatory:
Nearly
90
percent
of
the
Californian
speakers
produced
as
in
think...with
the
tip
of
the
tongue
protruded
between
the
teeth
so
that
the
turbulence
is
produced
between
the
blade
of
the
tongue
and
the
upper
incisors
Only
10
percent
of
the
British
speakers
made
this
sound
in
this
way;
90
percent
of
them
used
an
articulation
with
the
tip
of
the
tongue
behind
the
upper

teeth
[p
143]
One
is
moved
to
enquire
how
the
sound
is
articulated
by
speakers
of
other
English
dialects
or
in
other
regions
(New
England
for
example)
but
the
book
does
not
go
into

The
organization
is

Ronald
Rose
writes
weekly
column
about
language
in
The
Canberra
Times
and
this
book
is
collection
of
those
essays
fleshed
out
in
full
in
those
instances
where
they
might
have
been
cut
by
the
newspaper
for
economy
of
space
The
essays
are
brief
and
interesting
and
range
throughout
the
entire
spectrum
of
the
subject
including
literature
There
is
for
example
piece
on
spoofs
in
which
Rose
cites
several
that
are
well
known
omits
others
(like
Poe's
The
Great
Balloon
Hoax)
and
includes
at
least
one
that
is
satire
which
is
different
sort
of
animal:
Gulliver's
Travels
is
not
to
my
mind
spoof
am
all
in
favor
of
weekly
columns
on
language
but
one
must
be
careful
Rose
is
now
seventy-six
and
evidently
going
strong
The
book
is
informative
and
entertaining
but
the
reader
should
check
the
validity
of
some
of
Rose's
comments
before
incorporating
it
into
doctoral
dissertation
or
other
important
work
That
admonition
applies
also
to
the
blurb
on
the
back
cover
which
presumably
was
composed
by
somebody
at
Kangaroo
Press
but
not
submitted
to
Rose
for
approval
It
refers
to
His
vulgar
vocabulary
and
facility
in
slang
butâmore
importantâit
offers
oddities
like
reference
to
learning
by
rote
on
page
105
and
to
Pidgin
on
page
41:
upon
looking
both
up
found
nothing
about
rote
learning
on
page
105
and
nothing
about
Pidgin
on
page
41;
nor
was
either
listed
in
the
sparse
index
The
cover
copy
also
refers
to
his
endlessly
entertaining
analyses
of
literary
terms
such
hypocorism
sic
palindrome
clerihew
idiom
[and]
acronym:
of
these
acronym
and
hypocorism
are
as
absent
from
the
index
as
the
as
between
such
and
hypocorism
Perhaps
such
curiosities
will
make
the
book
collector's
item
but
whoever
wrote
the
text
for
it
at
Kangaroo
ought
to
be
relegated
to
the
outback
am
prejudiced
know
but
while
find
the
use
of

as

an
interesting
linguistic
development
consider
it
execrable
style
for
literate
speakers
and
(especially)
writers;
yet
it
appears
in
Rose's
Preface
where
one
can
also
find
transitive
use
for

please
note)
It
is
not
de
rigueur
for
linguists
or
lexicographers
to
utter
judgments
about
language
just
as
doctors
are
not
supposed
to
react
with
revulsion
should
patient
reveal
particularly
revolting
affliction
But
it
seems
to
me
(occasionallyâlike
now)
that
it
is
just
such

Sparse
index
Donald
Davidson's
Philosophy
of
Language
From
the
cover:
The
guiding
intuition
is
that
Davidson's
work
is
best
understood
as
an
ongoing
attempt
to
purge
semantics
of
theoretical
reifications
Seen
in
this
light
the
recent
attack
on
the
notion
of
language
itself
emerges
as
natural
development
of
his
Quinian
scepticism
towards
meanings
and
his
rejection
of
referencebased
semantic
theories
Statistics

Dialectology
From
the
cover:
[P]rovides
clear
easily

Bilingualism
From
the
cover:
This
book
is
general
introduction
to
the
study
of
bilingualism
from
combined
sociolinguistic
and
psycholinguistic
perspective...
Professor
Romaine
explores
bilingualism
as
both
societal
and
cognitive
phenomenon...
The
author
also
assesses
the
positive
and
negative
claims
made
for
the
effects
of
bilingualism
on
children's
cognitive
social
and
academic
development
and
examines
the
assumptions
behind
various
language
policies
and
programs
for
bilingual
children
Autosegmental
Metrical
Phonology
From
the
cover:
This
is
the
first
complete
introduction
to
the
current
generative
theoretical
phonology
presenting
general
introduction
to
the
two
theories
of
phonological
representation
that
lie
at
the
center
of
current
research
In
addition
the
central
issues
and
tenets
of
lexical
phonology
are
set
out
and

evaluated
Gender
Voices
From
the
cover:
Does
the
language
we
speak
create
and
sustain
sexist
culture?..
The
authors...explore
...the
idea
that
language
shapes
individual
livesâthat
through
our
speech
we
all
help
recreate
gender
divisions
in

varies
in

The
Oxford
English
Grammar
Undertaking
description
of
language
may
be
regarded
as
curious
occupation
Writing
reviews
of
them
is
no
less
odd
an
experience
For
various
reasons
have
chosen
to
comment
on
only
certain
aspects
of
this
book
chiefly
because
thorough
review
would
occupy
far
more
space
in
VERBATIM
than
many
readers
might
willingly
tolerate
Suffice
it
to
say
that
the
grammar
is
Chomskyan
and
though
bit
thin
on
the
ground
is
quite
adequate
have
found
other
things
to
criticize
however
that
may
be
more
germane
to
books
in
general
especially
reference
books
and
particularly

First
want
to
vent
my
spleen
on
publishers'
book
designers
who
haven't
the
slightest
idea
of
what
they
are
doing
As
one
case
in
point
cite
The
Random
House
Dictionary
of
the
English
Language
Second
Edition
in
which
possibly
in
order
to
mimic
other
dictionaries
but
probably
because
there
are
few
things
that
designers
can
get
their
grubby
little
fingers
into
the
main
entry
words
were
reset
in
sans-serif
type
presumably
just
to
make
them
harder
to
read
Those
who
are
not
designers
but
typographers
steeped
in
statistics
of
readability
and
other
scientific
applications
to
typography
are
fully
aware
that
because
of
the
redundancy
built
into
its
characters
almost
any
serif
font
is
more
(readily)
legible
than
any
sans-serif
face
and
trying
to
make
book
look
modern
by
using
sans-serif
makes
no
sense
at
all
Besides
there
is
nothing
modern
about
sans-serif
type:
if
anything
it
is
moderne
âthat
is
in
the
tradition
of
Art
Deco
Turning
to
the
illustrations
(including
the
black-and-white
maps)
in
the
RHD2e
it
must
be
said
that
the
originals
were
model
of
clarity
and
detail:

it
was
among
my
responsibilities
to
commission
them
and
to
accept
or
reject
completed
artwork
or
to
have
it
modified
That
was
laborious
and
time-consuming
task
amply
rewarded
by
the
high
quality
of
the
drawings
as
published
in
the
original
edition
In
the
Second
Edition
however
the
designers
took
it
upon
themselvesâmerely
for
the
sake
of
change
believeâto
lay
fine
screen
over
every
illustration
(except
the
maps)
thus
losing
much
of
the
finical
detail
originally
produced
The
result
is
dull

As
if
to
confirm
that
the
various
afflictions
of
designers
have
infected
the
UK
operations
of
Oxford

Press
we
are
now
faced
with
Greenbaum's
Grammar
which
can
only
be
said
to
have
suffered
Worse
their
incredibly
unimaginative
work
has
resulted
in
book
that
ought
to
have
been
about
400
pages
shorter
than
the
present
work
which
shall
explain
In
his
Preface
Professor
Greenbaum
suggests
that
the
Grammar
can
be
used
as
work
of
reference
The
structure
of
the
bookâthrough
no
fault
of
the
author's
am
sureâmilitates
against
such
use
for
the
Index

the
user
to

sections:
each
chapter
is
numbered
from

and

looked
up

in
the
Index
and
found
might
3.25;
4.29;
5.17
24
The
first
problem
inherent
in
the
poor
design
of
the
book
is
that
there
is
no
clue
in
the
running
heads
as
to
which
chapter
and
section
one
has
turned
to
(unless
he
has
chanced
on
the
beginning
of
chapter
or
section:
only
the
page
number
appears)
The
section
titles
and
numbers
frequently
appear
at
the
gutter
column
making
it
almost
impossible
to
thumb
through
the
book
to
find
reference
quickly
As
it
happens
both
the
title
of
subsections
3.25
and
4.29
happen
to
be
in
the
gutters
of
the
pages
where
they
begin
making
it
inconvenient
to
find
them
Had
these
numerals
been
set
at
the
foredge
of
the
pages
(instead
of
the
page
numbers
which
serve
no
discernible
useful
purpose)
finding
the
proper
chapter
and
subsection
numbers
would
have
been
greatly
facilitated
The
second
problem
is
the
(unexplained)
style
24
which
should
properly
be
designated
5.24:
there
are
only
12
chapters
so
it
is
confusing
to
see
reference
apparently
to
chapter
that
is
really
reference
to

the
Index
entry

dictionaries
are
listed
8.28

but

contains
no
subsections
beyond
8.21
clearly
mistake.)
Third
excluding
the
Appendix
and
Glossary
the
book
contains
only
600
pages
and
presumably
to
bulk
up
its
page
count
(probably
at
the
instigation
of
the
publisher
so
that
more
money
could
be
charged
for
it)
the
designer
has
employed
hanging
indention
of
about
ten
picas
and
wide
interlinear
spaces
The
result
had
the
book
been
set
to
full
measure
is
that
it
would
have
been
less
than
400
pages
long
Fourth
relating
specifically
to
the
entries
looked
up

both
mentioned
except
for
the
following
passing
remark

no

Their

are
often
used
to
refer
to
present
or
future
time:
He

She

my
car
tomorrow
That
is
not
inaccurate
but
it
scarcely
tells
the
full
story
nor
is
it
particularly
helpful
in
explaining
the
use
of
may
which
is
the
present
of
which
might
is
the
past
in
constructions
like
She

There
is
no
internal
cross
reference
to
5.24
B
where
the
notions
of
Permission
and
Possibility
are
given
peremptory
coverage
(though
there
are
six
citations)
and
no
helpful
comment
is
offered
about
their
interchangeability
in
contemporary
usage
or
what
was
formerly
their
distinction
in
formal
contexts
Fifth
the
Glossary
(pp
615-35)
concerns
itself
largely
with
the
terminology
of
Chomskyan
grammar
but
the
treatment
is
unsatisfactory
For
instance
rhotic
accent
Non-rhotic
accents
drop
the
/r/
when
it
is
followed
by
consonant
sound
as
in
part
They
also
drop
the
/r/
at
the
end
of
word
when
it
comes
before
pause
Rhotic
accents
retain
the
/r/
It
is
poor
style
to
find
the
headword
term
defined
virtually
as
an
afterthought
The
entry
at
mass
noun
is
cross
reference
See
count
noun.;
but
the
definition
at
count
noun
makes
no
mention
of
mass
noun
Although
the
definition
for
common
noun
consists
of
cross
reference
to
proper
noun
there
is
no
proper
definition
for
it
at
proper
noun
only
contrastive
comment
from
which
one
is
supposed
to
derive
definition
by
default
As
only
Chomskyan
grammar
is
covered
in
the
book
entries
are
lacking
for
such
common
grammatical
conceptsâalbeit
from
other
disciplines
like
traditional
grammarâ
substantive
dependent
clause
independent
clause
conjunctive
adverb
adverbial
conjunction
misplaced
(or
dangling)
modifier
etc.âall
terms
well
established
in
discussions
of
nonChomskyan
grammar
Many
of
the
definitions
use
terms
that
are
not
themselves
defined
and
are
not
always
transparently
clear
e.g.
postmodify
linguistic
unit
etc
Some
of
these
shortcomings
can
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
author
some
at
the
door
of
the
book
designer
most
in
the
lap
of
the
editor
(if
there
was
one)
It
is
undeniable
that
the
word-stock
of
language
can
be
derived
from
vast
corpus
of
its
writing
and
speech
to
produce
dictionary;
grammar
can
be
likewise
derived
but
such
exercises
are
rare
and
are
usually
confined
to
work
on
dead
languages
Thus
Champollion
had
little
enough
to
go
on
to
decipher
the
Rosetta
Stone
and
Ventris
would
have
been
hard
put
to
find
native
speaker
of
Minoan
Linear
(or
A)
But
for
modern
languages
the
situation
is
different
Preparing
monolingual
English
dictionary
lexicographers
who
are
native
speakers
of
English
may
often
turn
to
citations
of
usage
in
context
to
derive
or
verify
senses
of
some
words;
but
for
words
whose
meanings
they
already
know
they
can
rely
on
their
own
knowledge
and
use
citations
for
confirmation
Relying
solely
on
one's
own
knowledge
can
be
dangerousâwitness
Johnson's
definition
of
pastern
âso
one
must
always
check
and
double-check;
but
that
is
not
difficult
matter
if
citation
material
is
available
and
there
are
usually
other
books
or
specialists
one
can
consult
(Let
me
say
parenthetically
that
not
only
is
there
nothing
wrong
with
looking
at
others'
work
but
that
those
who
studiously
avoid
doing
so
for
any
reason
are
extremely
foolish:
how
can
one
know
how
the
competition
has
handled
something
without
checking?
Aside
from
the
unavoidable
fact
that
competition
is
driving
force
in
the
publication
of
such
works
one
can
scarcely
expect
to
improve
on
the
competitive
works
without
knowing
what
they
are
up
to.)
Writing
grammar
entails
many
judgements
but
the
most
relevant
for
my
purposes
here
is
to
wonder
about
the
amount
of
information
brought
to
the
task
by
the
grammarian
It
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
subject
will
be
approached
with
feigned
tabula
rasa
relying
solely
on
citation
materials
But
the
question
arises
whether
the
grammar
is
constructed
from
what
is
known
(or
found)
and
then
verified
through
the
application
of
suitable
citations
whether
the
grammar
is
citation-driven
or
combination
of
the
two
is
employed
In
any
event
the
requirement
for
an
experienced
grammarian
is
undiminished
In
principle
one
must
question
the
function
of
grammar
In
essence
such
work
cannot
be
more
or
less
than
description
of
how
language
works
But
the
question
must
arise
in
the
mind
of
the
publisher
(if
not
the
grammarian)
Who
is
going
to
use
the
book?
That
is
not
readily
answered
these
days
There
was
time
when
students
were
required
to
study
the
grammar
of
the
language
but
that
day
appears
to
be
gone
Today
then
we
might
more
logically
be
looking
at
market
consisting
of
people
who
want
reference
grammar
that
is
one
in
which
they
can
find
answers
to
their
questions
about
how
the
language
works
This
raises
question
germane
to
the
Oxford
English
Grammar
Professor
Greenbaum
has
drawn
on
the
huge
resources
of
number
of
different
corpora
of
English
that
have
been
gathered
at
the
Survey
of
English
Usage
and
several
other
research
centers
all
of
which
are
listed
in
an
Appendix
[pp
601-14]
The
sources
of
the
citations
range
widely
and
include
telephone
conversations
classroom
lessons
broadcast
interviews
parliamentary
debates
spontaneous
commentaries
business
transactions
news
broadcasts
etc
One
could
scarcely
disagree
with
the
fact
that
all
of
these
make
up
reasonable
crosssection
of
what
must
be
categorized
as
the
popular
use
of
language
Throughout
the
Grammar
are
interspersed
quotations
from
these
sources
each
carefully
documented
That
might
well
provide
reasonably
accurate
picture
of
contemporary
language
But
is
that
what
user
of
the
Grammar
as
reference
grammar
might
want?
One
of
the
beauties
of
the
Oxford
English
Dictionary
(and
of
say
Grammar
of
the
English
Language
by
George
O
Curme)
is
that
users
are
comforted
by
quotations
from
sources
that
are
acknowledged
paragons
of
English
usage
writers
like
Shakespeare
Milton
Dickens
Scott
etc.
even
Hemingway
Are
they
likely
to
be
attracted
by
evidence
from
students'
conversations
with
their
flatmates?
from
recordings
of
Christmas-dinner
family
conversations?
could
find
only
twenty
books
that
had
been
mined
for
citations
and
all
were
published
in
1990
(I
hasten
to
say
that
although
the
Curme
Grammar
is
VERBATIM
Book
my
purpose
in
bringing
it
up
is
not
to
sell
books
but
to
contrast
its
content
with
that
of
the
subject
Grammar
.)
There
is
still
another
aspect
to
the
whole
business
of
citations
Some
thirty
years
ago
proposed
that
the
most
relevantly
useful
attribute
of
citations
was
their
exposure
that
is
the
number
of
people
who
on
the
basis
of
readership
statistics
could
be
assumed
to
be
reading
and
listening
to
the
manifestations
of
language
presented
in
books
newspapers
magazines
and
radio
and
television
broadcasts
Word
XXVI
3:
An
Unabridged
Word
Count
of
English]
The
exposure
of
word
would
be
expressed
as
an
index
number
resulting
from
the
normalization
of
(unwieldily
large)
numbers
of
readers
and
listeners
and
would
be
likely
to
provide
some
meaningful
measure
of
the
frequency
for
significantly
large
percentage
of
the
lexicon
Prior
to
that
frequencies
had
been
calculated
on
the
basis
of
raw
occurrences
in
text
selected
by
researcher
at
whim
though
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
books
(at
least)
selected
for
examination
were
classics
of
literature
assumed
to
be
widely
read
taught
and
used
as
models
of
effective
expression
(if
one
insists
on
avoiding
the
concept
of
good
English)
In
resorting
to
sources
that
might
be
justifiably
viewed
as
natural
language
those
who
concur
with
Professor
Greenbaum's
approach
ignore
this
important
aspect
of
citational
matter
am
not
sure
that
anyone
has
attempted
their
documentation
but
it
is
well
known
that
an
enormous
number
of
clichÃ©s
idioms
metaphors
and
other
expressions
used
in
everyday
contemporary
speech
and
writing
derive
from
the
writings
of
Shakespeare
and
other
contributors
to
the
imagery
and
poetry
of
the
language
While
their
manifestations
undoubtedly
appear
in
the
snatches
of
telephone
and
flatmate
conversations
recorded
in
the
numerous
corpora
cited
in
the
Appendix
to
the
Grammar
their
exposure
is
virtually
asymptotic
to
zero
In
other
words
there
are
some
who
believe
that
we
might
be
well
advised
to
attend
to
what
Milton
Donne
Dryden
Jefferson
Franklin
Lincoln
Byron
Shelley
Keats
Austen
Alcott
Dickens
and
thousands
of
others
have
contributed
to
the
molding
of
the
language
in
all
its
reflexes
and
who
find
it
difficult
to
understand
the
usefulness
to
be
derived
from
an
analysis
of

is

that

of
the

be
said

to

and
yielding

Also
comments
regarding

nothing

[p

though
why
and
is
italicized
in
the
original
is
hard
to
understand
It
may
be
argued
that
in
descriptive
grammarâhow
can
grammar
be
anything
but
descriptive?
âcomment
about
good
and
bad
English
are
anathema
but
weasily
little
comments
can
be
inserted
(as
they
are
in
dictionary
usage
notes)
referring
to
careful
speakers
educated
users
their
peers
and
others
whom
users
of
grammar
might
conceivable
wish
to
emulate
Thus
rare
is
the
dictionary
that
offers
infer
as
synonym
for
imply
without
some
sort
of
label
Even
the
permissive
Merriam-Webster
III
while
remaining
tight-lipped
about
usage
condescends
to
offer
see
IMPLY
at
definition
of
infer
As
those
who
use
infer
for
imply
might
be
somehow
stigmatized
in
(some)
educated
circles
failure
to
report
such
usage
leaves
the
suspicious
user
of
dictionary
(or
grammar)
who
has
the
wit
to
look
it
up
facing
serious
lacuna
in
the
information
given
about
the
language
Such
information
is
not
prescriptive
or
proscriptive
it
is
descriptive
of
certain
attitudesâright
or
wrongâabout
the
language
and
has
its
proper
place
in
dictionary
Comparable
grammatical
usages
merit
mention
and
appropriate
comment
In
subsection
called
Good
English
Greenbaum
makes
passing
reference
to
the
aesthetic
use
of
language
[1.10];
but
remarks
concerning
artistic
use
of
language
are
notably
absent
presumably
lest
they
constitute
some
sort
of
value
judgment
As
we
all
know
the
grammar
has
been
distorted
by
political
correctness

in
avoiding

School
before
his
or
her
eighteenth
birthday
may
be
asked
to
write
to
state
his
or
her
reasons
can
be
clumsy
The
basic
question
is
To
what
use
can
such
book
be
put?
There
can
be
no
confuting
the
fact
that
the
grammar
of
modern
Englishâthat
is
the
English
in
use
for
the
past
two
centuriesâdiffers
little
from
that
of
earlier
stages
of
the
language:
after
all
languages
are
sorted
and
distinguished
by
linguists
on
the
basis
of
their
grammars
not
their
lexicons
(Thus
English
is
Germanic
language
because
of
the
history
of
its
structure
or
grammar;
were
its
lexicon
alone
to
be
considered
it
might
well
be
classified
as
Romance
language
owing
to
the
large
percentage
of
words
of
French
and
Latin
origin.)
There
is
no
gainsaying
the
advantages
in
having
an
up-to-date
grammar
of
English
Though
personally
am
not
enamored
of
Chomskyan
grammar
despite
its
occasional
departures
from
traditional
terminology
nouns
and
adjectives
are
still
nouns
and
adjectives
The
chief
aim
remains
thorough
consistent
coherent
preferably
understandable
description
of
the
structure
of
language
Indeed
some
of
Greenbaum's
presentation
amounts
to
tacit
commentary
on
and
reflects
valid
criticism
of
the
inconsistencies
found
in
traditional
grammar
Unfortunately
the
commentary
being
tacit
is
bit
too
subtle
for
many
of
the
people
who
are
likely
to
refer
to
the
Grammar

The
Word
At
first
the
idea
that
there
can
be
single
word
in
English
or
in
any
language
that
merits
the
creation
of
232-page
volumeâdirectory
rather
than
dictionaryâ
devoted
to
it
exclusively
must
seem
preposterous
But
with
the
initial
riffle
through
the
pages
of
The
Word
noting
the
different
typefaces
that
designate
parts
of
speech
definition
date
of
origin
source
examples
it
becomes
evident
that
this
word
is
the
great
workhorse
an
old
familiar
in
The
Life
and
indeed
deserving
The
Word
the
work
of
the
scholar
etymologist
who
is
resident
editor
in
the
dictionary
department
at
Random
House
proves
to
be
rare
item
indeed:
comprehensive
vastly
eclectic
tongue-in-cheek
serious
treatment
that
has
to
be
the
first
and
last
word
on
this
world-class
Word
For
the
curious
layperson
it
will
be
source
of
amazement
and
information
good
deal
of
it
funny
including
many
of
the
anecdote-examples
but
some
of
it
revealing
and
far
from
funny
Funny
are
the
ingenious
hybrids
elaborate
euphemisms
and
novel
insult-categories
Not
funny
think
are
numbers
of
sex-related
terms
referring
to
actions
or
practices
more
traditionally
the
subjects
of
reports
by
physicians
psychiatrists
the
courts
and
increasingly
stories
in
the
media
That
some
of
the
terms
like
the
practices
are
nearly
as
old
as
printing
cuts
or
ought
to
cut
the
ground
out
from
under
those
authorities
who
attribute
it
all
to
the
'60s'
and
post-'60s'
generations
It
takes
no
more
than
preliminary
skim
to
suspect
what
is
soon
substantiated
in
the
ample
sources
and
usages
that
accompany
most
entriesâthat
it
is
within
the
military
services
of
the
United
States
and
Great
Britain
from
the
times
of
the
World
Wars
that
the
F-words
have
their
truest
homes
Why
this
is
so
might
provoke
some
thought
Is
it
kind
of
barracks
clannishness?
Certainly
it
is
macho
masculine
kind
of
thing
with
more
than
touch
of
adolescent
snobbery
in
one's
familiarity
with
special
treasure

as

or
B.F.D

instance
comes
to
mind
from

1941-1946

There's

in

sets
out

The

Zach
Arnold
is
fully
versed
in
the
theory
and
practice
of
punning
and
clearly
has
it
in
his
bones
He
knows
about
LÃ©vi-Strauss's
notion
of
intellectual
do-it-yourself
bricolage
)
Each
of
his
punstruments
creatively
cannibalizes
and
recycles
preexisting
materials
all
that
comes
to
hand
He
is
fully
aware
too
of
the
very
ancient
tradition
of
the
rebus
the
pictorial
pun
Not
letting
his
own
exuberance
run
away
with
him
he
prudently
issues
safety
warning
about
the
manipulation
of
tools
and
substances
Throughout
rhetoric
figures
of
speech
music
and
handymanship
feed
productively
and
voraciously
off
each
other
After
all
the
pun
is
in
(typically)
more
senses
than
one
first
mock-up
and
then
if
it
works

As
Freud
underlined
playing
on
the
multiple
meanings
of
words
is
an
exercise
in
thrift:
two
or
more
meanings
for
one
word
or
phrase
Wit
is

In
more
technological
terms
like
the
computer
as
Arnold
says
the
pun
enables
continuous
flip-flop
(though
flip
gags
often
flop)
The
computer's
version
of
this
is
switching
between
two
stable

(unstable

of
course
any
shuttling
begets
an

Punning
is
often
as
with
the
suck-blow
mouth-organ
vamping
i.e.
harping
extracting
blood
out
of
victim
or
camping
around
The
punner
like
Arnold
prolifically
spawns
neologisms
inkhorn
terms
even
nonce-words
As
well
as
being
purely
verbal
the
pun
can
be
visual
kinetic
gestural
Arnold
in
fact
offers
useful
tips
(patter
stage-business)
for
performing
his
pieces
rather
like
the
word-balloons
in
cartoons
As
it
is
the
humble
brazen
harmonica
he
suggests
for
the
repertoire
pop
songs
of
all
epochs
or
popular
classics
As
always
in
any
collection
of
wordplays
manyâ
mostâare
terrible
or
toothless
(e.g.
Tuning
Fork
which
lacks
the
desirable
distance
between
the
two
items
suddenly
conjoined)
He
is
fully
conscious
of
his
own
for
which
he
coins
cacohomonym
Swift
said
that
like
fleas
puns
get
everywhere
The
impulse
in
this
book
is
macaronic
hybrid
adhocist
ecumenical
miscegenating
Example:
sabot
boat
although
one
could
use
it
on
any
day
of
the
week
and
not
just
on
the
sabat
or
shabath
which
immediately
tempts
one
to
throw
the
baby
out
with
the
shabath
probably
the
best
solution
âif
somewhat
murky
and
not
potableâafter
all
This
has
the
pseudo-shamefaced
but
essentially
brass-necked
mark
of
the
inveterate
punner
There
is
of
course
method
in
his
madness
(it
has
been
claimed
that
puns
introduce
lunacy
into
language
but
it
was
there
all
along)
and
capering

his

Brigid

claims
that
the
original
name
for
the
Beatles
was
The
Golden
Beatles
This
caught
my
eye
right
away
as
it
is
well-known
fact
among
Beatles
fans
that
one
of
the
original
names
for
the
band
was
The
Silver
Beatles
This
name
appeared
after
few
changes
in
line-up
of
the
members
and
in
their
name
such
as
The
Quarrymen
and
Johnny
and
the
Moondogs
After
reading
through
some
Beatles
literature
it
becomes
obvious
there
are
some
inconsistencies
as
to
how
the
Beatles
chose
The
Silver
Beatles
after
calling
themselves
Johnny
and
the
Moondogs
though
the
fact
remains
that
they
never
called
themselves
The
Golden
Beatles
The
best
explanation
for
the
name
Beatles
can
be
traced
directly
to
the
music
that
influenced
Lennon
McCartney
Harrison
and
Sutcliffe
at
the
time
and
to
their
music
idol
Buddy
Holly
The
music
of
the
early
1960s
in
the
Liverpool
area
was
often
referred
to
as
beat
music
and
so
modeling
themselves
after
Holly's
band
the
Crickets
John
who
couldn't
resist
pun
suggested
Beatles
as
play
on
beat
music
Where
the
Beatles
got
Silver
from
is
harder
to
trace
One
source
claims
that
silver
was
an
obscure
reference
to
Long
John
Silver
highlighting
Lennon's
role
as
band
leader
This
proves
true
when
recalling
other
band
names
from
the
early
1960s
such
as
Gerry
and
the
Pacemakers
Rory
Storm
and
the
Hurricanes
and
Derry
and
the
Seniors
all
names
that
point
out
that
one
member
was
the
leader
Other
people
have
dismissed
the
adjective
Silver
as
merely
an
addition
to
give
the
name
some
flash
The
language
of
the
Beatles
what
they
said
what
they
wrote
about
and
first
of
all
what
they
called
themselves
is
an
important
part
of
Western
culture
Most

in

that

are
not

to

by
Milton
Horowitz
Surely
the
vehicle
for
carrying
the
Russian
word
into
Modern

Hebrew
was
Yiddish!
And
in
Yiddish
balagan
means
mess
bedlam
(Uriel
Weinreich's
Yiddish-English
Dictionary

It
is

think
that

change
when

cross

frontiers
and
what
was

quite
intentional
am

was
that

else
These

the

The
name
of

is

the

of
its

Lecoq

to
his

Gallia
Gaul

The
history
of
the
discovery
and
naming
of
the
lanthanides
(the
fourteen
rare-earth
elements
with
atomic
numbers
58
to
71
in
Mendeleev's
table)
is
fascinating
In
1788
the
mineral
ytterbite
(now
gadolinite
was
discovered
near
the
Swedish
village
(not
town)
of
Ytterby
The
Finnish
chemist
Gadolin
isolated
new
earth
(metallic
oxide)
there
in
1794
and
called
it
yttria
In
1803
the
Swedish
chemist
Berzelius
discovered
another
earth
and
named
it
cerium
for
the
asteroid
(minor
planet)
Ceres
Take
just
yttria
In
1843
the
Swedish
chemist
Mosander
analysed
this
earth
into
yttrium
proper
erbium
and
terbium
all
named
for
Ytterby
In
1878
the
Swiss
chemist
Marignac
further
isolated
ytterbium
and
in
1879
the
Swedish
chemist
Cleve
distinguished
holmium
(named
for
Stockholm)
and
thulium
(from
Thule
the
farthest
land
known
to
the
Greeks)
In
1886
the
aforesaid
Lecoq
de
Boisbaudran
(who
had
already
discovered
gallium
in
1875)
isolated
dysprosium
(Greek
for
difficult
to
reach)
In
1907
the
French
chemist
Urbain
separated
lutetium
from
ytterbium
naming
it
for
his
native
Paris
(Roman
name
Lutetia
)
Cerium
has
its
own
similar
development
so
that
by
the
early
20th
century
all
14
lanthanides
had
been
isolated
(The
element
with
atomic
number
61
is
not
found
naturally
and
this
number
was
allocated
to
promethium
when
proof
of
its
existence
was
confirmed
by
American
chemists
who
named
it
for
Prometheus
in
Greek
mythology
the
earliest
teacher
and
benefactor
of
mankind.)

To
Coin
Name
and
Name
Coin
Around
six
years
ago
not
long
after
Canada
replaced
its
green
Queen's
one-dollar
note
with
an
eleven-sided
gold-coloured
coin
schoolyard
ditty
made
the
rounds:
We're
tiny
we're
tuney
We
haven't
got
loonie
Because
of
Brian
Mulroney
and
the
stupid
G.S.T
Mulroney
rhymes
with
loonie
Brian
Mulroney
was
Canada's
prime
minister
at
the
time
The
most
unpopular
PM
in
Canada's
modem
history
he
introduced
the
Goods
and
Services
Tax
VAT-like
national
sales
tax
Loonie
is
the
well-nigh
universal
Canadian
slang
term
for
the
dollar
coin
(Only
the
Royal
Canadian
Mint
refers
to
the
loonie
as
dollar
coin.)
Canada
almost
didn't
have
loonie
The
original
design
for
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin
featured
voyageurâ
the
same
as
on
the
older
nickel
dollarâbut
the
dies
were
stolen
on
the
way
to
the
Royal
Canadian
Mint
in
Winnipeg
where
the
first
coins
were
due
to
be
minted
The
backup
design
was
that
of
loonâour
unofficial
national
bird
Ah
but
that
unfortunate
name:
loon
as
in
loony
bin!
Although
the
terms
loonie
diminutive
noun
from
loon
and
loony
an
adjective
(ultimately)
from
lunar
are
etymologically
distinct
their
similarity
has
encouraged
obvious
satirical
connections:
our
economy
which
is
loony
has
as
its
fundamental
unit
of
currency
the
loonie;
many
felt
that
the
policies
of
Brian
Mulroney
were
loony
In
short
the
slang
term
sprang
up
immediately
and
collectively
and
no
one
person
could
ever
claim
to
be
the
inventor
of
it
However
two-dollar
coin
is
due
to
be
introduced
soon
in
Canada
and
the
etymological
situation
here
is
totally
different
story
The
Mint
as
usual
is
no
helpâthey
refer
to
the
new
coin
unimaginatively
as
the
two-dollar
coin
so
the
letters
columns
of
every
newspaper
in
the
country
have
been
filled
with
speculation
and
suggestions
for
slang
term
for
this
new
coin
which
is
slightly
larger
than
the
loonie
gold-coloured
and
polygonal
(like
the
loonie)
but
with
silver
centre
with
polar
bear
pictured
on
it
Once
the
design
was
released
the
name
bruin
was
suggested
by
many
people
but
the
name
that
appears
to
be
winning
is
doubloonie
combining
the
double
loonie
with
reference
to
traditional
coin
said
to
be
favoured
by
piratesâagain
not-too-subtle
satirical
reference
to
the
appetite
for
taxation
of
most
governments
may
have
the
dubious
distinction
of
being
the
first
to
propose
this
name
in
letter-to-the-editor
published
in
Canada's
newspaper
of
record
The
[Toronto]
Globe
and
Mail
on
20
February
1993
long
before
the
Mint
announced
the
coin
At
that
time
the
idea
had
occurred
to
me
because
knew
that
both
New
Zealand
and
Australia
had
one-dollar
and
two-dollar
coins:
had
been
to
Australia
several
times
on
business
and
had
seen
them
To
me
it
appeared
to
be
just
matter
of
time
before
Canada
also
introduced
two-dollar
coin
but
it
took
an
article
in
the
Globe
and
Mail
on
the
need
for
two-dollar
coin
to
concentrate
kind
of
critical
mass
of
public
attention
onto
the
issue
What
actually
appears
to
happen
in
cases
like
this
is
that
neologisms
do
not
appear
like
single
light
bulb
going
off
in
one
person's
head
but
rather
like
wheat
after
spring
rains:

seventeen
and
soixante-quinze
sixty
plus
fifteen
which
require
mental
agility
just
to
translate
them
into
the
figures
97
and
75?
The
comparable
English
three
score
years
and
ten
is
certainly
more
poetic
than
the
simpler
seventy
but
doubt
whether
it
was
ever
used
in
calculations
It
is
hardly
surprising
that
the
French-speaking
Swiss
and
Belgians
prefer
their
own
system
which
like
English
has
separate
words
for
seventy
and
ninety
They
along
with
English-
and
German-speaking
children
would
appear
to
have
head
start
over
the
French
The
German
system
of
saying
numbers
in
reverse
order
(like
the
old
English
four
and
twenty
may
even
make
calculations
easier
as
children
are
usually
taught
to
start
with
the
units
column
before
moving
on
to
the
tens
and
hundreds
My
admiration
for
the
French
has
however
paled
into
insignificance
since
started
learning
to
count
money
in
Mina
language
spoken
in
Togo
and
parts
of
Benin
and
Ghana
was
astounded
to
realize
that
illiterate
market
women
(Benin
has
an
illiteracy
rate
of
over
75%)
happily
multiply
five
by
thirteen
and
add
one
hundred
while
my
brain
is
still
struggling
to
work
out
whether
this
comes
to
more
or
less
than
150
Counting
money
in
Mina
involves
using
multiples
of
five
as
far
as
twenty-five
and
then
using
combination
of
multiples
of
twenty-five
and
five
as
far
as
one
hundred
Even
numbers
greater
than
100
are
sometimes
expressed
as
multiples
of
twenty-five
This
means
that
180
CFA
francs
can
be
expressed
as
one
hundred
plus
sixteen
fives
or
as
one
hundred
plus
three
twenty-fives
plus
five
or
yet
again
as
seven
twenty-fives
plus
five
After
this
humbling
experience
am
inclined
to
review
my
earlier
belief
that
French
children
must
be
at
disadvantage
when
it
comes
to
mental
arithmetic
In
fact
children
who
grow
up
speaking
language
such
as
French
or
Mina
which
obliges
them
to
make
connections
between
numbers
and
introduces
them
to
multiples
at
very
early
age
probably
take
to
arithmetic
faster
than
those
who
plod
along
adding
one
to
the
previous
number
ad
infinitum
The
Bahamas
and
the
Bahamians
Like
handful
of
emeralds
scattered
across
blue
velvet
the
verdant
islands
of
the
Commonwealth
of
the
Bahamas
stretch
across
100,000
sq
miles
(259,000
sq
km)
of
the
Atlantic
Ocean
The
700
islands
and
numerous
smaller
cays
(pronounced
âkeysâ)
that
comprise
this
semitropical
archipelago
start
55
miles
(90
km)
east
of
Palm
Beach
Florida
and
arc
600
miles
(970
km)
southeast
toward
eastern
Cuba
and
Haiti
like
series
of
stepping
stones
linking
North
America
with
the
Caribbean
Some
of
the
islands
are
only
few
hundred
square
meters
in
size
but
together
they
make
up
an
area
of
5,380
sq
miles
(14,000
sq
km)
slightly
smaller
than
the
area
of
the
Hawaiian
Islands
Only
100
of
the
islands
are
inhabited;
many
of
these
have
become
private
playgrounds
for
the
rich
and
super-rich
Even
fewerÂ âÂ 37
to
be
exactÂ âÂ have
settlements
or
towns
This
leaves
many
hundreds
of
cays
that
are
totally
natural
untouched
by
the
destructive
influence
of
humans
and
offering
pristine
habitats
to
hundreds
of
bird
and
animal
species
The
Bahamas
islands
are
the
flattened
peaks
of
huge
ancient
mountain
range
that
once
towered
many
thousands
of
feet
into
the
sky
They
now
lie
low
in
the
water
the
highest
pointÂ âÂ Mount
Alvernia
on
Cat
IslandÂ âÂ being
only
206
ft
(65
m)
above
sea
level
The
eastern
coastlines
of
the
islands
break
the
long
tidal
fetch
that
travels
across
the
Atlantic;
on
the
sheltered
western
coastline
coral
outcrops
have
produced
vast
shallow
sand
banks
that
reflect
waters
of
myriad
translucent
blues
and
greens
Indeed
it
was
these
characteristic
shallow
banks
that
gave
the
Bahamas
islands
their
name
When
Spanish
explorers
came
to
map
the
area
in
the
16th
century
they
named
the
area
baja
mar
or
shallow
seas
as
warning
to
the
galleons
that
would
be
sailing
through
the
waters
The
name
was
later
anglicized
and
the
Bahamas
were
born
The
warning
on
Spanish
maps
unfortunately
did
little
to
stop
ships
from
running
aground
or
foundering
on
the
treacherous
shoals;
even
today
treasure
lost
centuries
ago
is
still
being
discovered
and
salvaged
The
islands
of
the
Bahamas
were
claimed
by
the
English
but
hundreds
of
secret
coves
became
home
to
pirates
and
smugglers
who
turned
their
backs
on
nationality
to
enter
the
brotherhood
of
buccaneers
They
ruled
the
seas
plundering
ships
at
will
and
then
spent
their
ill-gotten
gains
in
the
bars
and
brothels
of
Nassau
town
the
main
settlement
Later
as
the
English
colonies
of
North
America
fought
for
independence
the
islands
became
refuge
for
fleeing
loyalists
who
sought
to
make
new
life
on
these
remote
picturesque
cays
Cotton
production
brought
number
of
slaves
to
the
islands
but
the
crops
proved
to
be
poor
and
depleted
the
already
weak
soil
Sponge
gathering
was
devastated
after
fungus
attacked
the
crop
and
sisal
was
produced
more
cheaply
in
South
America
The
population
eked
out
living
but
little
more
than
that
Things
changed
in
the
1920s
however
when
the
Bahamas
profited
from
the
American
policy
of
Prohibition
Rum-running
became
major
industry
and
well-to-do
Americans
began
making
the
short
trip
to
the
Bahamas
to
be
able
to
drink
legally
and
to
indulge
in
other
pleasures
Since
World
War
II
the
Bahamas
has
worked
hard
to
extend
the
service
it
provided
during
Prohibition
and
has
turned
itself
into
âparadiseâ
for
holiday-makers
The
dazzling
beaches
are
covered
with
fine
sand
that
ranges
from
bright
white
to
pastel
pink
The
sun
shines
year-round
with
temperatures
ranging
from
the
high
60s
to
the
high
80s
fahrenheit
To
these
natural
ingredients
have
been
added
just
about
every
amenity
and
service
needed
for
the
perfect
holiday
Everything
centers
on
New
Providence
where
most
of
the
tourists
stay
and
half
of
the
Bahamian
population
lives
One
of
the
largest
cruise
ports
in

Nassau
can
accommodate
15
large

English
âpomp,â
stout
forts

buffs
Grand
Bahama
the
second
most
populous
island
has
FreeportâLucaya
Nassauâs
younger
less
genteel
âAmericanâ
cousin;
nightlife
here
is
more
lavish
and
audacious
than
in
Nassau
Both
islands
have
large
resort
hotels
that
offer
water-sports
floor
shows
and
casinos
where
you
can
enjoy
the
thrill
of
winning
or
the
dejection
of
losing
Golf
courses
entice
you
to
lower
your

Tour
buses
plow
path
around
the
attractions
and
duty-free
shops
tempt
you
to
buy
that
little
luxury
item
youâve
been
denying
yourself
for
so
long
Hundreds
of
day-trippers
cruise
to
both
islands
eager
to
do
it
all
before
they
have
to
get
back
on
the
boat
On
the
smaller
and
more
remote
islandsÂ âÂ called
the
Out
Islands
or
Family
IslandsÂ âÂ intimate
resorts
cater
to
your
every
need
and
make
it
possible
for
you
to
forget
about
schedules
deadlines
and
traffic
jams
The
most
difficult
decision
youâll
have
to
make
is
what
to
pick
from
the
extensive
dinner
menu
While
the
clubs
and
casinos
may
not
play
on
into
the
night
during
the
day
youâll
be
worn
out
by
walks
along
the
beach
and
other
strenuous
activities
such
as
collecting
sea
shells
enjoying
long
lunches
and
applying
sunblock
The
whole
trip
could
prove
to
be
exhausting!
The
lure
of
the
Bahamas
is
of
course
as
much
about
the
sea
as
it
is
about
the
land
The
waters
of
the
western
Atlantic
are
still
some
of
the
clearest
and
most
beautiful
in
the
world
In
summer
the
shallows
are
glassy
still
and
range
from
azure
blue
to
emerald
green;
the
deep
ocean
channels
reflect
deep
blue
that
can
best
be
appreciated
from
the
air
The
sandy
shallows
are
ideal
for
swimming
and
snorkeling
and
since
the
development
of
scuba
(an
acronym
for
self-contained
underwater
breathing
apparatus)
gear
in
the
1930s
the
seas
around
the
Bahamas
have
become
top
destination
for
diving
enthusiasts
from
around
the
world
The
waters
of
the
Bahamas
support
vast
range
of
life
and
contain
percent
of
the
worldâs
coral
Diving
around
the
reef
surfaces
and
the
vertical
reef
walls
is
complemented
by
many
ship
wrecks
and
artificial
sitesÂ âÂ large
concrete
blocks
which
are
placed
on
the
sea
bed
to
encourage
coral
growthÂ âÂ surrounding
the
islands
Fish
species
mass
in
the
vast
shallows
along
with
urchins
and
starfish
Yet
deep
ocean
channels
cut
between
some
island
groupsÂ âÂ the
Tongue
of
the
Ocean
between
Andros
and
New
Providence
for
example
is
6,000
ft
(2,000
m)
deepÂ âÂ and
these
provide
thoroughfare
for
number
of
large
fish
and
marine
mammal
species
such
as
sharks
rays
dolphins
and
turtles
This
not
only
provides
excitement
for
divers
who
can
watch
shark
feeding
in
the
wild
on
some
Bahamian
islands
but
also
to
fishermen
The
vast
numbers
of
large
fish
species
including
record
breaking
marlin
and
bonefish
make
for
some
of
the
most
challenging
and
thrilling
sport-fishing
in
the
world
On
top
of
the
water
the
shallow
channels
and
sheltered
seas
provide
ideal
waters
for
sailing
and
cruising
Hundreds
of
unmanned
cays
offer
idyllic
destinations
and
mooring
points
The
desert
island
you
always
dreamed
about
is
somewhere
in
the
BahamasÂ âÂ the
Exumas
themselves
have
one
cay
for
every
day
of
year
and
that
is
only
one
part
of
the
vast
Commonwealth
Many
lie
only
few
hours
sailing
time
from
the
hubbub
of
Nassau
The
Bahamian
people
are
among
the
friendliest
youâll
ever
meet
and
they
are
eager
to
share
the
homeland
they
love
with
visitors
The
population
is
fascinating
mixture
of
descendants
of
the
Loyalist
settlers
who
left
America
after
the
American
Revolution
freedom
lovers
who
escaped
religious
persecution
and
ex-slaves
set
free
following
emancipation
This
mixture
which
could
have
produced
society
fraught
with
problems
has
evolved
into
gentle
sociable
and
happy
people
proud
of
their
homeland
and
the
progress
they
have
made
since
independence
in
1973
With
stable
economy
good
health
and
no
taxes
itâs
no
wonder
that
smile
comes
naturally
to
all
Bahamians
All
the
communities
still
have
strong
religious
faith
the
pretty
churches
are
full
on
Sundays
and
conversation
about
some
future
event
always
ends
with
ââ¦God
willingâ
or
ââ¦with
the
Lordâs
blessing.â
To
make
the
most
of
your
trip
youâll
need
to
tune
your
mind
to
âBahamian
time.â
On
New
Providence
and
Grand
Bahama
this
may
not
be
much
slower
than
at
home
but
on
the
Out
Islands
time
definitely
runs
more
slowly
and
nothing
is
so
important
that
it
canât
wait
while
People
are
more
important
than
to-do
lists
so
leisurely
exchange
of
greetings
and
an
inquiry
about
your
familyâs
well-being
precedes
any
business
activity
This
genuine
thoughtfulness
also
extends
to
visitors;
someone
will
always
go
out
of
their
way
to
be
helpful
in
ways
that
have
been
lost
in
more
developed
locations
Every
island
has
its
own
individual
character
forged
by
unique
history
and
development
in
fact
the
Bahamas
could
be
said
to
be
several
different
holiday
experiences
in
one
country
so
itâs
important
to
choose
your
island
carefully
to
get
the
kind
of
holiday
you
want

However
youâll
probably
need

normal
routine
to
enjoy
it
as
the
locals
do
Theater
performances
are
followed
by

often
after
11pm
and
if
you
intend
to

out
to

donât
expect

Even
if
you
only
want
to
sample
the
delights
of
Greek
tavernas
and
perhaps
stroll
around
Plaka
the
real

starts
after
9pm
when
Greek

come
out
to

Sports
The
proximity
of
Athens
to
the
coast
offers
great
opportunity
to
combine
beach
activities
with
city
vacation
Traveling
by
taxi
from

hotel
it
only
takes
30
minutes
to
find
some
excellent
facilities
Much
of
Athens
closes
down
during
the
heat
of
August
(though
not
those
relating
to
tourism)
and
many
people
head
to
the
coast
for
the
cooler
air
therefore
you
find
the
resorts
very
busy
at
this
time
The
season
is
short
with
many
hotels
opening
in
May
and
closing
again
in
September
The
closest
resort
to
the
city
is
GlyfÃ¡da
only
12
km
(7
miles)
from
the
city
Its
proximity
to
Athens
makes
it
extremely
busy
especially
on
weekends
and
it
lies
very
close
to
the
approach
to
the
old

which
in
the
past
resulted
in

of

noise
Twenty
kilometers
(12

popular

Shopping
Athens
offers
multitude
of
shopping
opportunities
not
only
for
typical
Greek-style
souvenirs
but
for
haute
couture
good
art
and
jewelry
The
good
news
is
whatever
your
budget
youâre
bound
to
find
something
exciting
to
take
homeÂ âÂ whether
you
want
mass-produced
items
or
unique
hand-finished
pieces
As
with
any
large
city
individual
districts
specialize
in
certain
types
of
goods
so
here
is
short
rundown
of
what
is
available
Where
to
Shop
For
undeniably
tourist
kitsch
head
for
the
streets
of
Plaka
and
youâll
find
mass-produced
items
of
all
kinds
They
are
interspersed
with
galleries
T-shirt
shops
and
numerous
street
hawkers
selling
fun
toys
or
handmade
budget
art
MonistirÃ¡ki
is
the
old
bazaar
area
of
the
cityâââthe
Sunday
flea
market
is
must
for
collectors
of
old
china
memorabilia
and
furnitureÂ âÂ and
the
myriad
small
shops
sell
all
kinds
of
collectibles
in
addition
to
good-value
street
clothing
Kolonaki
is
the
favorite
district
of
Athenians
for
the
boutiques
and
home
furnishings
stores
that
sell
the
best
of
European
design
Prices
match
the
quality
here
but
if
you
donât
want
to
spend
just
sit
at
streetside
cafÃ©
and
watch
the
Athens
jet-set
do
little
shopping
The
maze
of
streets
around
the
Cathedral
offers
religious
souvenirs
of
all
kinds
Incense
burners
icons
and
tamataÂ âÂ votive
offeringsÂ âÂ are
the
most
portable
Athens
Municipal
Market
just
south
of
Omonia
Square
offers
wonderful
fresh
food
for
you
to
enjoy
as
you
stroll
as
well
as
numerous
Greek
foodstuffs
to
take
home
The
streets
of
Ermou
Eolou
and
Stadiou
offer
large
department
stores
and
numerous
pan-European
names
with
everything
from
shoes
and
clothing
to
household
wares
In
many
parts
of
the
city
prices
are
flexibleÂ âÂ though
not
in
department
stores
and
boutiquesÂ âÂ and
haggling
is
expected
at
the
flea
market
In
tourist
shops
you
may
get
discount
for
cash
and
prices
are
lower
early
and
late
in
the
season
Conversely
you
may
be
charged
little
extra
if
you
want
to
pay
by
credit
card
What
to
Buy
Copper
and
brassware:
Copper
and
brass
have
been
used
for
many
household
utensils
for
centuries
and
skilled
craftsmen
still
work
in
small
workshops
around
the
city
The
newly
produced
goods
have
bright
patina
that
mellows
with
use
and
some
of
the
older
pieces
are
exceptionally
beautiful
Antiques
stores
in
MonastirÃ¡ki
have
the
best
choice
and
these
include
urns
for
carrying
water
samovars
bowls
and
tureens
Ornate
Ottoman
tables
on
folding
wooden
bases
are
compact
enough
to
carry
in
hand
luggage
as
are
serving
ladles
and
goat
bells
Ceramics:
The
skills
honed
at
Kerameikï¿½ï¿½s
centuries
ago
are
still
much
in
evidence
on
the
streets
of
Athens
You
can
buy
exquisite
hand-thrown
and
painted
copies
of
ancient
pieces
for
price
and
numerous
examples
of
less
expensive
factory
produced
items
Traditional
shapes
of
urns
jugs
and
cups
are
decorated
with
scenes
taken
from
the
lives
of
the
ancients
or
of
the
Greek
gods
in
their
domain
on
Mount
Olympus
Modern
ceramic
artists
also
thrive
and
there
are
many
small
galleries
showcasing
hand
created
pieces
Statuary:
If
you
want
little
piece
of
ancient
Greece
then
youâll
certainly
be
able
to
find
it
It
will
be
reproduction
of
courseÂ ââbut
still
you
can
own
your
own
copy
of
Zeus
Poseidon
or
Athena
herself
small
enough
to
grace
table
or
large
enough
to
decorate
garden
Plaques
depicting
ancient
friezes
or
masks
to
hang
on
walls
are
also
extremely
popular
as
are
Mycenaean
helmets
If
classical
statuary
is
too
ornate
for
your
taste
you
can
also
find
copies
of
the
minimalist
Mycenaean
statues
found
at
the
Goulandris
Museum
The
National
Archaeological
Museum
also
has
wide
range
of
copies
of
its
artifacts
Each
comes
with
certificate
of
authentication
Leatherware:
Local
craftsmen
have
always
worked
goat
and
cow
hides
and
the
industry
continues
today
Footwear
bags
and
clothing
come
in
range
of
styles
though
quality
is
generally
more
rustic
and
bohemian
than
similar
items
produced
in
Italy
or
France
Carpets
and
needlepoint:
Ottoman
craftsmen
left
behind
legacy
in
both
the
use
and
production
of
fine
carpetsÂ âÂ look
for
hand-knotted
ornate
patterns
in
wool
or
silk
which
come
with
hefty
price
tag
Hand-produced
Greek
flotaki
rugs
were
traditionally
used
in
farmhouses
across
the
Greek
world
and
are
made
from
sheep
wool
They
are
sold
by
weight
and
are
decorated
with
traditional
symbols
such
as
deer
or
patterns
such
as
the
Mycenaean
geometric
designs
Needlepoint
crochet
and
embroideryÂ âÂ once
activities
undertaken
by
every
Greek
womanÂ âÂ are
now
dying
arts
so
any
hand-crafted
pieces
will
become
collectorsâ
items
of
the
future
Machine-produced
pieces
are
readily
available
in
the
form
of
tablecloths
napkins
cushions
and
handkerchiefs
Or
you
could
try
traditional
embroidered
hat
complete
with
long
silk
tassel
now
only
worn
during
folkloric
spectacles
Jewelry:
When
Schliemann
excavated
the
tombs
of
the
Mycenaean
rulers
he
found
their
skulls
decorated
with
masks
fashioned
from
pure
gold
Since
that
time
Greece
has
been
famed
for
the
worksmanship
of
this
most
precious
metal
and
you
can
still
find
many
high
class
jewelry
stores
in
Athens
producing
excellent
quality
items
Athenians
still
love
to
adorn
themselves
as
they
did
in
ancient
times
with
gold
and
with
precious
stones
imported
from
elsewhere
Prices
are
very
competitive
as
gold
is
sold
by
weight
with
relatively
small
mark-up
for
the
craftsmanâs
skill
however
always
check
with
prices
at
home
if
you
intend
to
make
major
purchase
Most
popular
items
are
traditional
patterns
passed
down
since
ancient
times
The
major
museums
also
sell
copies
of
items
displayed
which
are
quite
appropriate
souvenirs
of
your
trip
For
those
whose
taste
or
budget
isnât
for
precious
metals
and
stones
there
is
whole
range
of
jewelry
featuring
semi-precious
stones
and
street
jewelry
such
as
rings
earrings
toe
rings
and
though
not
strictly
jewelry
worry
beadsÂ âÂ carried
by
most
Greek
men
to
calm
the
nervesÂ âÂ are
very
decorative
The
best
feature
beads
of
cornelian
or
amber
with
silver
decoration
and
silk
thread
Icons
and
Art:
An
icon
is
religious
portrait
usually
of
saint
or
apostle
These
were
development
from
the
fayum
paintings
that
covered
the
face
of
the
dead
in
the
sarcophagi
of
Egyptian
mummies
Icons
lie
at
the
heart
of
Byzantine
or
Orthodox
worship
in
both
the
Greek
and
Russian
churches
and
they
form
focus
for
prayerÂ âÂ the
characteristic
gold
leaf
used
in
their
production
symbolized
the
glory
of
God
For
centuries
they
were
popular
souvenirs
of
the
grand
European
Tour
or
religious
pilgrimage
However
modern
production
methods
including
thin
artificial
canvas
and
gaudy
synthetic
colors
saw
them
lose
favor
In
recent
years
there
has
been
rebirth
in
icon
painting
using
traditional
methods
both
for
church
renovations
and
for
commercial
sale
Natural
pigments
and
egg
tempura
(egg
yolk
and
vinegar)
binding
are
painstakingly
mixed
and
applied
to
canvas
bound
over
wood
The
gold
leaf
is
then
applied
and
the
whole
image
is
given
patina
This
time-consuming
work
is
exquisite
and
correspondingly
expensive
Pre-1821
icons
will
require
an
export
permit
Youâll
find
mass-produced
icons
in
many
tourist
shops
but
for
quality
pieces
visit
specialist
store
Icons
are
very
particular
form
of
art
and
if
they
are
not
to
your
taste
there
is
whole
range
of
art
to
choose
from
Scenes
of
Athens
and
the
classical
sites
are
extremely
popular
as
mementos
Edibles:
Wonderful
foods
from
the
Greek
countryside
include
honey
olives
and
olive
oil
and
nuts
such
as
almonds
and
hazelnuts
All
can
be
bought
in
pretty
packaging
for
you
to
take
home
For
something
little
stronger
try
ouzoÂ âÂ the
aniseed
flavor
aperitifÂ âÂ or
Greek
brandy
which
is
slightly
sweeter
than
French
Cognac
Metaxa
is

Things
to
Do
with
Children
Athens
requires
some
forethought
if
you
are
taking
young
children
Not
all
will
be
as
eager
to
spend
days
at
the
ruins
and
it
can
be
oppressively
hot
during
the
summer
months
However
Greeks
love
children
and
they
will
be
most
welcome
and
fussed
over
in
tavernas
and
restaurants
which
makes
eating
out
delight
Here
are
some
ideas
for
child-friendly
visit:
Take
boat
trip
to
one
of
the
nearby
islands
Metro
ride
to
the
station
at
Pireaus
means
you
only
have
to
cross
highway
to
reach
the
ferry
port
and
numerous
destinations
are
only
an
hour
or
two
away
Children
will
love
the
journey
and
the
magic
of
reaching
seaside
destination
Take
time
out
in
the
cool
gardens
of
the
capital
The
National
Gardens
have
lake
with
water
birds
and
playground
and
Areos
Park
near
the
National
Archaeological
Museum
has
play
facilities
for
children
Let
your
children
have
their
portraits
doneÂ âÂ street
artists
can
be
found
in
PlakaÂ âÂ or
their
faces
painted
Either
way
they
get
to
be
the
center
of
attention
If
all
else
fails
day
at
the
beach
will
surely
blow
the
city
cobwebs
away
Take
break
at
GlyfÃ¡da
VoÃºla
or
VouliagmÃ©niÂ âÂ only
short
taxi
ride
away
Where
to
Go
The
Algarve
stretches
from
the
Atlantic
Ocean
to
Spain
but
itâs
actually
small
region
Faro
the
capital
is
just
50
km
(30
miles)
from
the
Spanish
border
and
it
is
only
112
km
(70
miles)
west
of
what
was
known
in
medieval
times
as
fim
do
mundo
(the
end
of
the
world)
at
Sagres
Along
this
160-km
(100-mile)
coastal
strip
resorts
and
holiday
villages
of
all
stripes
have
sprung
up
so
wherever
you
are
based
youâll
never
be
far
from
good
beach
reasonably
sized
town
village
or
resort
shops
and
nightlife
The
following
pages
cover
the
Algarve
traveling
west
to
east
though
you
could
certainly
do
the
reverse
or
begin
in
the
center
near
Faro
(or
anywhere
you
elect
to
stay)
and
embark
on
day
trips
both
east
and
west
from
there
For
those
with
additional
time
and
interest
in
seeing
more
of
Portugal
brief
section
on
the
Portuguese
capital
Lisbon
and
its
seductive
environs
is
included
Lisbon
is
about
four
hours
by
car
(and
40
minutes
by
plane)
from
Faro;
it
should
be
conceived
as
an
add-on
to
your
visit
to
the
Algarve
rather
than
day
trip
Many
people
visit
the
Algarve
by
flying
into
Lisbon
and
driving
to
the
southern
coast
If
you
are
flying
directly
to
the
international
airport
at
Faro
and
wish
to
spend
few
days
in
the
Lisbon
area
it
would
make
sense
to
see
about
return
flight
from
there
Worldâs
End:
Sagres
and
Cabo
de
SÃ£o
Vicente
If
you
begin
your
journey
at
Sagres
you
may
be
in
for
shock
The
hardscrabble
town
and
area
around
it
scarcely
look
the
part
of
fabled
beach
resort
with
Mediterranean
feel
Rather
it
is
remote
rugged
and
desert-like
with
only
relative
smattering
(compared
to
the
rest
of
the
Algarve)
of
hotels
restaurants
and
other
facilities
aimed
at
tourists
It
is
like
the
Algarveâs
outpost
which
is
precisely
why
it
has
so
many
admirers
Sagresâs
connections
to
the
sea
and
Portugalâs
maritime
exploits
are
strong
Prince
Henry
the
Navigator
established
his
Navigation
School
here
(though
some
protest
that
it
was
farther
east
near
Lagos)
The
town
has
picturesque
working
harbor
where
small
brightly
painted
fishing
boats
bob
and
larger
vessels
haul
in
daily
catches
of
lobster
eel
and
mackerel
couple
of
restaurants
are
clustered
around
the
harbor
with
impressive
views
Inland
cute
little
square
PraÃ§a
RepÃºblica
is
ringed
by
informal
(and
in
summer
hopping)
nightspots
The
best
beaches
near
Sagres
are
sheltered
and
not
overcrowded
Mareta
down
below
the
government
pousada
is
the
most
popular
Martinhal
just
east
of
the
harbor
is
wide
curved
beach
with
first-class
watersports
center
Beliche
(also
spelled
Belixe)
is
sandy
expanse
protected
by
the
Cape
of
St
Vincent
Tonel
just
before
Beliche
and
Telheiro
about
km
(6
miles)
up
the
west
coast
from
Sagres
are
also
well-regarded
beach
spots
Beyond
the
village
of
Sagres
great
rocky
peninsula
hangs
above
brooding
ocean
Youâll
understand
why
in
the
days
before
the
great
Portuguese
explorers
set
out
from
here
seeking
to
discover
the
great
beyond
it
was
known
as
the
End
of
the
World
Those
wishing
to
put
positive
spin
on
things
called
it
Sacrum
SaturniÂ âÂ Holy
PromontoryÂ âÂ and
believed
that
the
gods
slept
here
Since
time
immemorial
this
forlorn
place
has
stirred
the
imagination
It
stirred
Henry
and
his
sailors
who
are
said
to
have
set
up
camp
at
the
Fortaleza
de
Sagres
(Fortress)
that
sits
on
the
promontory
Unfortunately
not
much
of
the
original
has
survived
Most
of
it
is
17th-century
fort
that
was
insensitively
restored
In
1991
the
walls
of
this
nationally
important
monument
were
resurfaced
with
gray
concrete
destroying
the
external
character
of
the
building
The
fortressâs
principal
building
which
may
have
been
Henryâs
headquarters
has
been
demolished
What
youâll
find
inside
is
small
16th-century
chapel
Nossa
Senhora
da
GraÃ§a
and
what
looks
to
be
huge
stone
sun
dial
known
as
the
Rosa
dos
Ventos
(Rose
Compass)
Whether
in
fact
it
was
wind
compass
useful
in
the
great
voyages
is
unknown
modern

the
fortâs

couple
of
km
(one
mile)
west
of
Sagres
are
the
more
authentic
remains
of
another
fortress
Fortaleza
do
Beliche
This
small
attractive
17th-century
castle
houses
white
domed
chapel
(Santa
Catarina)
and
is
home
to
smart
traditional-style
restaurant
and
small
annex
to
the
pousada
in
Sagres
Both
the
fort
and
chapel
however
threaten
to
collapse
because
the
surrounding
cliffs
are
eroding
at
frightening
rate
Efforts
to
shore
up
the
cliffs
and
save
the
historic
site
have
recently
been
undertaken
The
windswept
cliffs
of
Cabo
de
SÃ£o
Vicente
the
most
southwesterly
point
in
Europe
were
once
surely
even
more
bleak
than
they
are
today
when
supertankers
and
small
yachts
heave
into
view
around
the
cape
But
even
on
the
calmest
of
days
the
Atlantic
thunders
below
and
the
wind
whips
around
the
cape
At
the
tip
of
the
point
the
lighthouse
built
in
1904
on
the
site
of
convent
chapel
has
beam
visible
up
to
96
km
(60
miles)
away
Visitors
can
climb
the
stairs
to
hot
enclosed
lookout
The
first
settlement
of
any
size
outside
Sagres
is
Vila
do
Bispo
km
(4
miles)
to
the
north
Take
break
in
the
peaceful
townâs
pleasant
flower-filled
garden
square
and
pay
visit
to
the
18th-century
parish
church
The
walls
are
covered
with
azulejos
and
its
ceiling
decorated
with
frescoes
About
halfway
between
Sagres
and
Lagos
Salema
is
regarded
as
an
up-and-coming
resort
of
this
stretch
with

sprinkling
of
bars
and
restaurants
pleasant

Burgau
3.2

east
is
small
and

Fishing
boats
pulled
up
onto
the
end
of
the
road
leading
down
to
the
beach
jostle
with
cars
The
beach
here
is
less
attractive
than
those
at
neighboring
Luz
or
Salema
but
the
small
village
retains
its
easygoing
character
Luz
is
pleasant
seaside
town
All
that
remains
of
old
Luz
is
the
church
and
opposite
the
fortress
which
has
been
attractively
renovated
and
converted
into
restaurant
There
is
good
beach
with
watersports
facilities
and
large
flat
rocks
where
vacationers
bask
in
the
sun
like
lizards
Lagos
Lagos
the
principal
resort
of
the
western
Algarve
is
the
rare
beach
town
that
offers
something
for
everyone
By
night
Lagos
is
lively
with
outdoor
restaurant
terraces
and
bars
attracting
hipper
crowd
than
most
resorts
on
the
coast
and
by
day
it
combines
rich
historical
past
with
busy
present
Attractive
beaches
are
just
on
the
outskirts
of
town
so
it
is
not
classic
resort
in
the
mold
of
Praia
da
Rocha
Your
first
view
of
Lagos
will
probably
be
from
the
long
riverside
Avenida
dos
Descobrimentos
which
divides
the
old
walled
city
from
the
port
At
the
other
end
of
the
avenue
the
well-restored
fortress
Forte
da
Ponte
da
Bandeira
once
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
harbor
in
the
17th
century
Cross
the
river
to
see
busy
fishermen
handsome
boats
anchored
in
the
marina
and
the
fine
view
of
the
city
above
the
walls
Many
of
the
streets
rising
towards
the
top
of
town
are
narrow
cobbled
and
more
accustomed
to
donkeys
than
rental
cars
Though
Lagos
town
still
retains
good
part
of
its
original
wallsÂ âÂ most
of
them
from
the
16th
century
but
part-Roman
in
placesÂ âÂ they
have
been
rebuilt
and
expanded
over
the
centuries
Climb
the
ramparts
for
fine
views
over
the
port
and
out
to
sea
Lagos
was
an
important
trading
port
under
the
Moors
but
the
town
enjoyed
its
heyday
after
the
Reconquest
It
was
proclaimed
the
capital
of
the
Algarve
and
the
governorâs
palace
became
the
headquarters
of
Prince
Henry
formal
statue
of
Henry
seated
with
sextant
in
hand
has
been
erected
on
plaza
(PraÃ§a
Dom
Henrique)
next
to
the
main
avenue
Arguments
persist
over
the
exact
whereabouts
of
the
princeâs
School
of
Navigation
but
it
seems
almost
certain
that
Lagos
was
the
principal
shipyard
and
port
serving
his
team
of
explorers
Those
were
glory
years
but
some
of
what
was
glorious
in
those
heady
times
today
seems
reprehensible
Explorations
along
the
west
coast
of
Africa
in
the
mid-15th
century
established
flourishing
slave
trade
and
Lagos
was
key
player
in
human
commerce
Just
behind
the
statue
of
Henry
on
the
corner
of
Rua
da
Senhora
da
GraÃ§a
you
can
still
see
the
small
arcade
where
Portugalâs
first
slave
auctions
took
place
small
plaque
states
simply
Mercado
de
Escravos
(Slave
Market)
Most
other
historic
buildings
around
the
square
succumbed
to
the
devastating
earthquake
of
1755
(see
page
18)
The
majority
of
the
cityâs
attractive
buildings
thus
date
from
the
late
18th
and
19th
centuries
On
Rua
General
Alberta
da
Silveira
the
tiny
chapel
Igreja
de
Santo
AntÃ³nio
an
exuberant
gilt
Baroque
work
and
one
of
the
Algarveâs
finest
churches
was
rebuilt
soon
after
the
earthquake
The
church
national
monument
dedicated
to
St
Anthony
has
handsome
display
of
18th-century
blue-and-white
glazed
tiles
and
brightly
painted
wood
ceiling
In
the
floor
youâll
find
the
tomb
of
an
Irish
colonel
Hugh
Beatty
soldier
of
fortune
who
commanded
the
Lagos
regiment
of
the
Portuguese
army
in
the
late
18th
century
and
who
must
have
been
held
in
very
high
esteem
to
have
been
awarded
such
prestigious
final
resting
place
The
entrance
to
the
church
is
actually

The
main
street
of
Lagos
is
the
charming
cobbled
Rua
25
de
Abril
packed
with
restaurants
bars
and
antiques
and
ceramics
shops
The
side
streets
hold
some
good
art
(and
craft)
galleries
and
plenty
of
rewards
for
exploration
The
square
at
the
end
of
25
de
Abril
holds
curious
statue
which
some
liken
to
an
extraterrestrial
of
the
boy-king
SebastiÃ£o
In
1568
Sebastian
became
king
of
Portugal
at
age
14
decade
later
he
embarked
on
disastrous
voyage
to
Morocco
to
fight
the
Moors
At
least
7,000
troops
died
the
king
included
(though
many
refused
to
believe
he
had
perished
and
Elvis-like
sightings
were
common)
The

from

1.6
km
(1

to
the
east
long
(4
km/21/2
mile)
flat
stretch
to
pocket-sized
coves
just
west
of
the
city
Weird
and
wonderful
rock
formations
and
steep
cliffs
that
glow
orange
at

have
made
them
some
of
the
most
photographed
in
Europe;
head
for
Praia
de
Dona

and
Praia

both
small
pretty
and
crowded
(street
signs
indicate
the
way
to
each)
At
the
southern
tip
just
before
it
turns
west
to
Sagres
are
the
coastâs
most
spectacular
sights
Ponta

of
the
long

into
the
sides
of
the

For
complete
change
of
scenery
take
drive
northwest
towards
the
hills
and
Bensafrim
Here
you
can
enjoy
the
Algarve
of
yesteryear

people
still
live

youâll
be
rewarded
with

PortimÃ£o
second
in
size
only
to
Faro
in
the
Algarve
is
the
most
workmanlike
town
on
the
coast
But
nestled
around
it
are
some
of
the
Algarveâs
finest
beaches
and
that
has
transformed
the
area
into
one
of
the
coastâs
most
popular
resorts
Praia
da
Rocha
and
Praia
TrÃªs
IrmÃ£os
in
particular
are
lined
with
hotels
and
beach-goers
Most
vacationers
stay
along
this
stretch
PortimÃ£o
sits
at
the
confluence
of
the
River
Adade
and
the
sea
and
most
of
its
local
color
is
down
by
the
port
haven
of
fishing
activity
The
top
fish-canning
spot
on
the
Algarve
PortimÃ£o
is
renowned
for
its
restaurants
specializing
in
sardinhas
grelhadas
(grilled
sardines)
Though
the
town
was
settled
by
the
Romans
it
was
one
of
the
Algarve
towns
most
damaged
from
the
earthquake
of
1755
and
as
consequence
has
few
buildings
or
monuments
of
historical
interest
Largo
1Â°

is
19th-century
addition
park
with
10
splendid
blue-and-white
azulejo
benches
each
illustrating
pivotal
event
in
the
history
of
Portugal
The
parkâs
name
alludes
to
the
date
December
1640
when
Portugalâs
independence
from
Spain
was
restored
(see
page
18)
Much
of
the
town
center
is
pedestrian-only
and
filled
with
shops
The
main
square
at
Rua
do
ComÃ©rcio
and
Avenida
SÃ£o
JoÃ£o
de
Deus
is
where
youâll
find
the
large
and
austere
ColÃ©gio
dos
JesuÃ­tas
(Jesuit
College)
The
church
constructed
at
the
end
of
the
17th
century
is
the
largest
on
the
Algarve
Across
the
plaza
is
the
old
market
building
now
used
for
temporary
art
exhibitions
Around
the
corner
along
Rua
Machado
dos
Santos
is
the
handsome
Igreja
de
Nossa
Senhora
da
ConceiÃ§Ã£o
sitting
atop
small
hill
and
incline
of
steps
The
yellow-and-white
church
originally
constructed
in
the
15th
century
has
beautiful
Gothic
portico
with
carved
capitals
but
looks
like
colonial
church
you
might
find
in
Brazil
due
to
its
reconstruction
and
remodeling
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
From
the
center
of
town
head
to
the
waterfront
especially
if
itâs
anywhere
near
time
for
lunch
or
dinner
You
can
almost
follow
your
nose
toward
the
heady
aroma
of
grilled
sardines
It
will
take
you
to
the
dockside
lined
with
simple
restaurants
one
after
the
other
all
serving
delicious
smoky
sardines
(and
other
fresh-caught
fish)
Choose
whichever
spot
seems
to
be
bustling
with
ravenous
patrons
plate
of
grilled
sardines
prawns
or
squid
and
bottle
of
house
wine
make
fantastic
meal
and
the
prices
are
about
as
low
as
anywhere
along
the
coast
The
hectic
operations
of
the
fishing
industry
used
to
take
place
here
right
under
the
noses
of
vacationers
with
frenetic
âbucket-brigadeâ
hauling
wicker
baskets
of
fresh
fish
up
from
the
boat
holds
to
ice
trays
and
waiting
trucks
right
next
to
dockside
dining
tables
The
fishermen
have
now
been
pushed
to
larger
location
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
but
most
sightseeing
boats
that
tour
the
harbor
and
nearby
grottoes
include
quick
trip
to
the
new
docks
You
will
still
see
fishing
boats
at
anchor
on
the
main
quay
but
the
majority
of
river
traffic
here
now
is
private

on
tourist

and
tiny

PortimÃ£oâs
other
claim
to
local
fame
is
as
comprehensive
regional

There
is
certainly
good

here
including
many
international
names
as
well
as
outlets

Just
km
(2
miles)
down
river
from
PortimÃ£o
is
Praia
da
Rocha
which
became
holiday
village
for
wealthy
Portuguese
families
back
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century
It
was
âdiscoveredâ
by
the
British
in
the
1930s
when
this
âbeach
of
rocks,â
strewn
with
extravagantly
shaped
eroded
stacks
provided
an
inspirational
refuge
for
writers
and
intellectuals
The
belle
Ã©poque
Hotel
Bela
Vista
is
living
monument
from
those
days
Today
the
long
2-km
(1.3
-mile)
golden
beach
is
still
the
main
attraction
but
the
once-small
village
fronting
the
beach
has
been
swamped
by
sea
of
hotels
and
tourist
facilities
Vestiges
of
the
villageâs
former
grandeur
can
still
be
traced
along
the
front
where
grand
old
buildings
jostle
uncomfortably
with
high-rise
blocks
The
sprawl
an
uncomfortable
update
of
Mallorcaâs
Playa
de
Palma
has
entirely
blurred
Praia
da
Rochaâs
separate
identity
from
PortimÃ£o
At
the
very
eastern
end
of
the
resort
guarding
the
River
Arade
is
the
Fortaleza
de
Santa
Catarina
de
Ribamar
(St
Catherineâs
Fortress)
built
in
1621
to
defend
Silves
and
PortimÃ£o
against
the
Moors
Little
remains
of
the
actual
fortress
but
its
courtyard
is
now
an
agreeable
terrace
where
you
can
enjoy
drink
and
watch
the
sardine
fleet
returning
to
port
Directly
across
from
the
fort
is
the
splendid
beige-colored
Fortaleza
de
Ferragudo
(closed
to
the
public)
which
looks
like
giant
sandcastle
The
old
fishing
village
of
Ferragudo
nearby
is
well
worth
visit
Despite
its
proximity
to
main

The
opposite
end
of
Praia
da
Rochaâs
long
stretch
is
known
as
Praia
do
Vau
The
splendid
rock
formations
and
coves
continue
but
this
end
of
the
beach
is
quieter
and
less
developed
than
the
eastern
end
Just
west
Praia
de
TrÃªs
IrmÃ£os
is
the
slightly
upscale
beach
cousin
of
Praia
da
Rocha
The
eastern
end
of
the
beach
is
beautiful

hemmed
in
by
cliffs
and
ochre
rocks
Beyond
it
the

stretches
to

North
of
PortimÃ£o
and
extending
across
the
western
half
of
the
province
is
the
Serra
de
Monchique
mountain
range
that
protects
the
coast
from
the
hot

farther
north
The
serra
is
verdant
landscape
of
cork

trees
and
low-lying

(two
separate
villages)
The
highest
point
is
FÃ³ia
The
first
stop
on
the
scenic
journey
along
route
266
is
the
spa
village
of
Caldas
de
Monchique
known
since
Roman
times
for
its
therapeutic
waters
Its
heyday
was
the
Edwardian
era
and
many
of
the
elegant
buildings
(including
casino
and
handicrafts
market)
still
date
from
this
period
An
air
of
nostalgia
has
long
presided
over
this
sleepy
hollow
but
massive
renovation
program
still
being
completed
in
late
2000
signals
the
local
desires
for
widening
its
tourist
appeal
Look
for
at
least
five
newly
renovated
hotels
restaurants
and
other
facilities
to
augment
the
usual
shops
in
the
very
near
future
In
the
meantime
Caldas
de
Monchique
is
good
place
for
picnic
and
stroll
in
the
woods
The
local
waters
are
bottled
and
for
sale
across
the
Algarve
North
of
Caldas
the
road
weaves
uphill
quickly
rising
300
(1,000
ft)
in
km
(3
miles)
past
terraced
farmlands
and
forests
of
eucalyptus
oak
and
cork
Monchique
is
small
market
town
known
for
its
handicrafts
and
the
famous
Manueline
portico
of
its
16th-century
Igreja
Matriz
The
beautiful
uncommon
church
has
Romanesque
arches
stone
columns
blue-and-yellow
azulejos
and
handsome
wood
ceiling
If
you
poke
around
town
youâll
probably
see
artisans
crafting
shoes
and
pounding
out
walking
sticks
in
closet-sized
workshops
High
above
the
town
the
ruins
of
17th-century
convent
Nossa
Senhora
do
Desterro
loom
like
ghostly
gray
eminence
Closed
to
the
public
it
has
apparently
been
seized
by
squatters
whoâve
done
little
towards
its
upkeep
other
than
festoon
it
with
âPrivateâFamilyâ
and
âFamily
Dogâ
signs
The
road
continues
upwards
passing
roadside
souvenir
and
fruit
vendors
and
few
well-placed
miradouro
restaurants
At
the
end
of
the
line
is
FÃ³ia
almost
915
(3,000
ft)
above
sea
level
affording
one
of
the
best
views
in
southern
Portugal
There
is
no
settlement
here
just
collection
of
craft
and
souvenir
stalls
bar
restaurant
and
an
obelisk
marking
the
highest
point
on
the
Algarve
On
clear
day
you
can
see
from
the
bay
of
PortimÃ£o
to
the
Sagres
peninsula
and
pick
out
the
rocky
outcrops
of
the
Lagos
beaches
Although
you
may
welcome
breeze
after
the
heat
of
the
coast
the
wind
blows
pretty
briskly
at
FÃ³ia
so
youâll
need
jacket
or
sweater
Donât
worry
if
youâve
forgotten
to
bring
one;
the
best
buys
among
the
souvenirs
here
are
chunky
hand-knitted
cardigans
and
pullovers
Silves
Back
down
the
main
road
toward
PortimÃ£o
turn-off
to
Silves
leads
to
the
former
Moorish
capital
of
the
Algarve
More
than
eight
centuries
ago
Silves
(then
known
as
Chelb)
was
magnificent
city
with
palaces
gardens
bazaars
and
huge
red
castle
on
hill
Granada
had
the
Alhambra
the
legendary
palace
of
the
Moors
but
the
Algarve
also
possessed
city
straight
out
of
Arabian
Nights
The
golden
age
of
Silves
began
in
a.d
711
with
the
Moslem
invasion
With
redoubtable
fortifications
and
population
in
the
tens
of
thousands
it
was
one
of
the
strongest
outposts
in
12th-century
Arab
Iberia
The
Crusaders
attacked
and
took
the
city
in
1189
only
to
see
it
recovered
by
the
Moors
two
years
later
half-decade
later
the
Christian
Reconquest
captured
Silves
for
good
However
the
loss
of
Arabic
wealth
and
the
silting
up
of
the
River
Arade
left
Silves
almost
literally
high
and
dry
and
by
the
time
the
bishopric
of
the
Algarve
was
transferred
to
Faro
in
1577
the
townâs
population
had
dwindled
to
140
Its
riches
were
stolen
long
ago
the
once-great
river
is
silted
shadow
of
its
former
self
and
Silves
is
now
just
dusty
backwater
but
the
glorious
setting
remains
Surmounted
by
its
red
fortress
the
white
town
climbs
the
hillside
from
the
river
its
medieval
bridge
still
intact
The
old
city
inside
the
gates
still
evokes
the
layout
of
the
Jewish
quarter
and
almedina
of
the
Moors
Though
castle
of
sorts
Silves
has
existed
here
since
Phoenician
times
the
present
Castelo
dos
Mouros
on
the
site
of
Roman
or
Visigothic
foundations
took
shape
after
the
Reconquest
though
it
preserves
distinctly
Moorish
lines
Oleander
and
jacaranda
soften
its
bellicose
nature
and
there
are
fine
views
over
the
tiled
roofs
of
the
town
and
surrounding
countryside
long-destroyed
âPalace
of
Verandasâ
once
existed
within
the
castle;
today
you
can
see
only
deep
well
(60
m/200
ft)
Next
to
the
castle
is
the
impressive
Gothic
SÃ©
Velha
(Old
Cathedral)
of
Silves
built
by
the
liberating
Crusaders
some
of
whom
are
buried
within
in
the
13th
century
The
remains
of
Moorish
mosque
are
hidden
behind
the
altar
Opposite
the
SÃ©
is
the
16th-century
Igreja
da
MisericÃ³rdia
with
classic
Manueline-style
side
door
Wander
down
to
the
main
square
the
PraÃ§a
do
Municipio
The
imposing
TorreÃ£o
da
Porta
da
Cidade
(Turret
of
the
City
Gate)
gives
you
good
idea
of
how
seriously
defense
of
the
city
was
taken
This
sturdy
warlike
structure
now
houses
the
peaceful
municipal
library
(open
to
the
public)
Close
by
on
Rua
das
Portas
de
LoulÃ©
is
modern
Museu
Municipal
(archaeology
museum)
Here
you
can
see
part
of
large
Arab
water
cistern
and
other
local
finds
The
hills
around
Silves
are
prosperous
farming
region;
figs
oranges
lemons
grapefruit
clementines
and
pomegranates
are
grown
in
abundance
in
mile
after
mile
of
orchards
Just
outside
the
city
on
the
road
to
SÃ£o
Bartolomeu
de
Messines
(route
N124)
is
an
important
16th-century
religious
sculpture
Known
as
the
Cruz
de
Portugal
(Cross
of
Portugal)
it
depicts
the
crucifixion
of
Christ
on
one
face
and
the
descent
from
the
cross
on
the
other
Some
speculate
that
the
cross
was
given
to
the
city
upon
the
transfer
of
JoÃ£o
IIâs
remains
to
Batalha
The
small
weather-beaten
3-m
(9-ft)
statue
easily
missed
is
really
only
of
interest
to
aficionados
of
religious
art
If
you
are
traveling
by
car
continue
to
the
Barragem
(dam)
do
Arade
The
water
collected
in
this
reservoir
surrounded
by
pine
hills
provides
irrigation
for
the
areaâs
profitable
orchards
Itâs
refreshing
spot
perfect
for
picnic
as
well
as
sailing
and
windsurfing
Lagoa
sizeable
town
east
of
PortimÃ£o
is
the
provinceâs
wine
capital
The
acidic
vinhos
da
casa
served
in
most
restaurants
on
the
Algarve
come
from
here
Lagoa
wine
both
red
and
white
is
more
powerful
than
ordinary
wine
and
the
extra
degree
or
two
of
alcoholic
content
can
creep
up
on
you
The
local
tourist
office
can
arrange
tours
of
wineries
and
tastings
(Adega
de
Cooperativa
de
Lagoa;

New
golf
courses
are
being
built
in
the
area
but
thereâs
little
else
to
detain
visitors
From
Lagoa
turn
south
about
km
(3
miles)
to
the
charming
resort
of
Carvoeiro
an
archetypal
small
Barlavento
resort
The
beach
is
about
the
size
of
tablecloth
compared
with
some
of
the
expanses
to
the
east
single
road
runs
down
through
pretty
valley
until
it
comes
to
small
crescent
of
sand
shared
by
families
of
sunbathers
and
fishing
boats
Above
rows
of
bright
white
houses
perch
on
red
sandstone
cliffs
while
cafÃ©s
and
restaurants
fill
the
spaces
in
between
The
original
village
of
Carvoeiro
is
now
fairly
commercialized
but
to
many
people
it
remains
one
of
the
coastâs
most
attractive
resorts
narrow
road
follows
the
cliffs
eastwards
to
the
geological
curiosity
of
Algar
Seco
(âdry
gullyâ)
Among
other
weird
and
wonderful
shapes
wind
and
wave
erosion
have
created
double-decker
stone
arch
There
are
walkways
down
to
lagoon
enclosed
by
menacing
rocks
and
if
weather
conditions
are
calm
this
open-air
grotto
is
paradise
for
snorkelers
Continue
east
and
you
will
find
three
more
beaches
whose
relative
isolation
has
thus
far
protected
them
from
development
They
are
(heading
east)
Vale
de
Centianes
Praia
do
Carvalho
and
Praia
de
Benagil
The
last
one
in
particular
is
superb
and
is
approached
down
vertiginous
road
flanked
by
massive
cliffs
Back
inland
just
off
the
main
road
is
the
attractive
little
village
of
Porches
with
some
classic
white
Algarvian
houses
and
filigreed
chimneys
Porches
is
famous
throughout
Portugal
for
its
hand-painted
pottery
though
you
wonât
find
much
in
the
village
itself
The
shops
of
greatest
renown
are
along
the
EN
125
route
Olaria
Algarve
(Tel
282/352
858)
better
known
as
Porches
Pottery
is
the
biggest
and
best
of
these
with
highly
original
designs
and
unique
colors
Inside
you
can
usually
see
trio
of
women
painting
pieces
Thereâs
also
an
attractive
little
cafÃ©-restaurant
itself
decorated
(of
course)
with
wonderful
ceramics
little
farther
east
is
Casa
Algarve
which
sells
pottery
and
handicrafts
in
an
attractive
old
house
More
than
others
it
specializes
in
large-scale
azulejo
panels
The
coastal
development
nearby
along
the
cliff
tops
continues
apace
However
the
vast
majority
of
apartments
and
villas
here
are
low-rise
and
perhaps
because
the
road
system
is
not
fully
developed
here
this
part
of
the
coast
has
largely
escaped
the
attentions
of
mass
tourism
One
of
the
most
photographed
beaches
along
this
stretch
is
Nossa
Senhora
da
Rocha
(Our
Lady
of
the
Rock)
The
rock
in
question
is
promontory
boldly
jutting
out
into
the
sea
surmounted
by
little
white
fishermenâs
church
On
either
side
of
the
rock
are
two
lovely
half-moon
coves
framed
by
cliffs
The
beach
of
ArmaÃ§Ã£o
de
PÃªra
is
one
of
the
longest
in
the
AlgarveÂ âÂ a
flat
golden
stretch
to
the
east
picturesque
rock
stacks
and
small
coves
to
the
west
The
massive
development
on
the
east
end
of
town
though
has
pretty
much
run
roughshod
over
the
natural
beauty
of
the
area
all
but
eclipsing
the
former
fishing
village
On
the
front
however
there
is
pleasant
esplanade
and
small
fortress
built
in
1760
which
contains
pretty
chapel
ALBUFEIRA
Albufeira
at
one
time
picturesque
fishermenâs
town
has
grown
wildly
in
recent
years
to
become
the
leading
resort
in
the
Algarve
The
area
now
generally
referred
to
as
Albufeira
encompasses
the
coast
from
beyond
GalÃ©
in
the
west
all
the
way
to
Praia
da
FalÃ©sia
just
before
marginally
distinct
resort
area
begins
at
Vilamoura
Parts
of
the
commercial
sprawl
while
rarely
grotesque
still
overwhelm
the
little
town
at
their
center
Once
youâre
off
the
traffic-squeezed
main
arteries
youâll
find
that
Albufeiraâs
old
town
preserves
surprising
bit
of
traditional
charm
The
cluster
of
whitewashed
buildings
includes
number
of
Moorish
arches
and
three
small
churches
Its
magnificent
settingÂ âÂ enormous
pockmarked
sandstone
cliffs
rise
above
huge
beach
lined
with
colorful
fishing
boats
and
hundreds
of
sunbathersÂ âÂ has
proved
resistant
to
development
ruin
The
gently
sloping
sands
are
perfect
for
family
holidays
and
if
you
are
looking
for
little
more
privacy
you
can
escape
the
crowds
by
heading
farther
east
along
the
sandy
coast
tunnel
links
the
center
of
the
town
with
the
main
beach
When
tractors
haul
the
fishing
fleet
ashore
sunbathers
jump
from
their
towels
to
gape
at
the
catchÂ âÂ 1-meter
(3-foot)
eels
still
flapping;
foot-long
spiny
lobsters
still
snapping;
and
bucketloads
of
flat
and
silver
fish
The
famous
beachside
fish
market
buckled
under
logistics
problems
years
ago
and
moved
just
north
of
the
center
It
is
still
worth
visit
however
and
you
will
also
find
fruit
vegetables
and
flowers
on
sale
Albufeiraâs
name
evokes
its
Moorish
roots
Indeed
the
North
African
occupiers
called
it
Al-Buhera
(âcastle
on
the
seaâ)
Its
cliff-top
position
and
labyrinthine
street
plan
provided
an
easily
defensible
spot
for
the
Moors
and
Albufeira
proved
one
of
the
last
towns
to
fall
during
the
Reconquest
Its
layout
however
did
not
save
it
from
the
1755
earthquake
during
which
the
town
was
almost
completely
destroyed
Modern
Albufeira
has
fallen
prey
to
mass
tourismÂ âÂ international
bars
cafÃ©s
and
nightspots
pump
out
loud
music
day
and
night
There
is
little
traditionally
Portuguese
about
its
raucous
central
square
but
there
are
quiet
spots
to
be
found
And
what
brings
all
the
tourists
here
the
Atlantic
is
just
splash
away
From
almost
any
vantage
point
the
view
of
old
Albufeira
sloping
up
gentle
hill
and
its
seascape
is
incredibly
spectacular
With
so
much
activity
to
the
east
the
excellent
beaches
west
of
town
are
relatively
uncrowded
The
best
are
SÃ£o
Rafael
beautiful
sandy
strip
with
some
splendidly
shaped
rocky
outcrops
and
Coelha
Castelo
and
GalÃ©
three
small
beautiful
coves
One
of
the
most
picturesque
towns
in
the
province
is
the
lovely
village
Alte
about
30
km
(18
miles)
north
of
Albufeira
It
is
entered
in
romantic
fashion
across
small
white
bridge
over
babbling
stream
that
runs
through
town
and
waters
rich
valley
thick
with
oranges
pomegranates
and
figs
The
architectural
highlight
of
the
village
is
the
beautiful
16th-century
Igreja
Matriz
entered
through
classic
Manueline
portal
The
church
keeper
will
enthusiastically
point
out
the
many
elaborate
chapels
and
the
rare
16th-century
Sevillana
azulejos
The
rest
of
Alte
is
the
Algarve
of
postcardsÂ âÂ white-washed
houses
along
narrow
streets
colorful
windows
filigreed
chimney
pots
and
red-tiled
roofs
And
while
their
character
may
at
first
seem
uniform
you
wonât
see
two
houses
the
same
Follow
the
stream
upriver
and
you
come
to
the
popular
Pequena
Fonte
(Little
Fountain)
springs
where
restaurant
and
occasional
folk
dancing
draw
visitors
The
setting
is
delightful
and
perfect
spot
for
picnic
If
you
continue
east
on
N-124
youâll
pass
rolling
hills
and
come
to
the
pretty
village
of
Salir
which
is
built
on
the
edge
of
steeply
rising
ridge
and
has
two
fine
lookout
points
The
first
is
in
the
village
itself
alongside
the
16th-century
parish
church
and
water
tower
(donât
miss
the
delightful
gardens
next
door)
The
other
with
the
best
views
is
the
adjacent
peak
which
once
held
Moorish
stronghold
(follow
signs
to
the
Castelo)
All
that
remains
of
the
castle
are
the
bases
of
four
huge
turrets
(12thâ13th
century)
and
some
excavations
The
old
castle
grounds
are
home
to
tiny
hamlet
complete
with
its
own
church
The
panoramic
views
across
to
the
main
part
of
Salir
and
the
surrounding
countryside
are
spectacular
and
there
is
even
tiny
miradouro
(belvedere)
cafÃ©
here
EAST
from
albufeira
Loosely
grouped
with
Albufeira
are
beaches
to
the
east
Here
the
coastline
features
the
last
of
the
dramatic
rock
formations
that
have
made
the
Algarve
so
famous
At
appealing
Olhos
dâAgua
single
road
leads
between
pine-covered
cliffs
down
to
soft
sandy
beach
shared
by
gaily
painted
fishing
fleet
eroded
sandstone
formations
and
sunbathers
The
resort
derives
its
name
from
the
âeyes
of
waterâ
that
flow
from
strangely
formed
rocks
visible
only
at
low
tide
FalÃ©sia
is
beautiful
beach
framed
by
high
cliffs
but
to
get
to
it
you
need
to
negotiate
the
grounds
of
the
Sheraton
Algarve
whose
elevator
down
to
the
beach
is
for
guests
only
There
are
other
excellent
beaches
at
Santa
Eulalia
(longer
and
more
open
than
Olhos
de
Agua)
Balaia
Praia
da
Oura
and
SÃ£o
JoÃ£o
The
latter
two
are
regarded
as
satellites
of
Albufeira
and
may
well
be
where
you
are
staying
on
package
holiday
to
Albufeira
The
center
of
activity
along
this
beach
hinterland
is
the
infamous
âstripâÂ âÂ a
long
street
leading
up
to
the
hilltop
area
known
as
Montechoro
As
the
name
indicates
itâs
lined
with
motley
collection
of
bars
restaurants
and
nightspots
Nearby
Vilamoura
is
wholly
planned
and
sanitized
communityÂ âÂ Europeâs
largest
âfrom-scratchâ
private
tourist
undertaking
From
high-rise
hotels
and
sprawling
villas
that
line
manicured
golf
courses
to
the
19th-hole
club
bar
and
the
Algarveâs
biggest
marina
it
is
undeniably
well
done
but
it
could
be
anywhere
Still
itâs
major
draw
for
those
who
have
their
clubs
ready
for
golfing
vacation;
several
of
the
Algarveâs
best
courses
have
been
sculpted
out
of
the
area
As
new
as
everything
looks
and
feels
the
marina
designers
were
not
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
Vilamouraâs
harbor
The
Romans
built
dock
in
the
same
place
and
established
an
important
fishing
center
here
The
Roman
remains
of
CÃªrro
da
Villa
were
unearthed
across
the
road
from
the
marina
Aside
from
some
low-level
excavations
showing
the
elaborate
water-piping
system
and
surviving
mosaics
and
ceramics
there
is
also
small
museum
displaying
everything
from
fishhooks
to
lamps
appealing
to
any
student
of
archaeology
little
farther
west
Quarteira
once
quiet
fishing
village
is
today
virtually
unrecognizable
subsumed
under
an
onslaught
of
rows
and
rows
of
apartment
buildings
The
busy
resort
has
long
golden
beach
and
there
are
good
cheap
restaurants
in
the
old
quarter
where
locals
and
adventurous
visitors
mingle
The
municipal
market
still
stands
on
the
beach;
every
Wednesday
one
of
the
largest
and
busiest
markets
on
the
AlgarveÂ âÂ offering
fish
and
produceÂ âÂ is
held
next
to
it
East
of
Vilamoura
and
Quarteira
the
Algarvian
terrain
begins
to
change
The
rugged
rocky
lines
of
the
Barlavento
coast
west
of
Faro
give
way
to
the
long
flat
beaches
of
the
east
The
small
crossroads
town
of
Almancil
has
shops
cafÃ©s
and
businesses
many
of
which
are
dedicated
to
serving
English
expatriates
But
the
town
of
modest
interest
itself
is
best
known
for
what
lies
in
its
vicinity
Many
of
these
ex-pats
live
just
few
miles
south
on
the
coast
and
it
is
here
that
two
of
the
Algarveâs
most
luxurious
and
exclusive
resorts
are
found
Surprisingly
given
their
status
neither
Vale
do
Lobo
nor
Quinta
do
Lago
are
well
sign-posted
off
the
main
road
Each
is
reached
down
long
roads
that
become
progressively
more
private-looking
as
the
beach
nears
Vale
do
Lobo
means
âValley
of
the
Wolves,â
but
it
could
just
as
well
mean
âValley
of
the
Dollsâ;
it
is
security-conscious
maze-like
villa
community
concealed
behind
giant
cheesy
entrance
gate
Guards
do
their
best
to
keep
the
beach
the
domain
of
the
expatriate
and
wealthy
tourist
classes
Quinta
do
Lago
few
miles
down
the
coast
refers
to
the
hotel
of
the
same
name
once
owned
by
Prince
Faisal
of
Saudi
Arabia
and
the
luxury
homes
that
have
sprouted
up
around
it
Quinta
do
Lago
has
one
of
the
finest
golf
courses
on
the
Algarve
which
is
designed
delicately
along
the
Ria
Formosa
Nature
Preserve
The
beach
is
reached
across
long
nostalgic
wooden
bridge
that
crosses
wetlands
and
bird
sanctuaries
On
the
beach
is
terrific
if
expensive
restaurant
for
fresh-caught
fish
which
you
pick
out
and
have
grilled
Back
toward
Almancil
is
one
of
the
Algarveâs
top
attractions
but
if
youâre
not
looking
closely
itâs
easy
to
miss
About
16
km
(10
miles)
west
of
Faro
simple
white
church
stands
out
on
small
hill
overlooking
the
thundering
highway
sign
simply
says
âS
LourenÃ§oâÂ âÂ indicating
the
turn-off
to
SÃ£o
LourenÃ§o
do
Matto
(Church
of
St
Lawrence
of
the
Woods)
Inside
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
displays
of
azulejo
design
youâll
ever
see
Every
square
inch
of
the
Baroque
15th-century
churchÂ âÂ its
walls
vaulted
ceiling
and
cupolaÂ âÂ is
covered
with
hand-painted
blue-and-white
ceramic
tiles
Most
date
from
the
early
18th
century
and
depict
biblical
scenes
detailing
the
life
of
St
Lawrence
born
across
the
border
in
Huesca
Spain
The
only
element
of
the
church
not
blue-and-white
is
the
carved
gilded
altar
The
ensemble
is
stunning
sight
not
to
be
missed
LoulÃ©
north
of
Almancil
is
regional
produce
center
with
large
Saturday
market
known
for
its
leather
lace
and
copper
goods
LoulÃ©
is
prosperous
town
with
an
ambitious
modern
boulevard
complete
with
outdoor
cafÃ©s
that
are
jam-packed
on
market
day
Coach
parties
come
from
far
and
wide
to
shop
at
the
colorful
bustling
market
There
are
actually
two
markets
Fresh
produce
including
fish
is
sold
in
mock-Moorish
hall
while
âgypsy
marketâ
is
held
towards
the
opposite
end
of
the
boulevard
Just
below
the
permanent
market
halls
on
the
main
PraÃ§a
da
RepÃºblica
youâll
find
well-preserved
section
of
the
medieval
castle
walls
(which
were
much
damaged
by
the
1755
earthquake)
The
ramparts
afford
excellent
views
from
the
town
and
set
into
the
castle
remains
is
modest
local
museum
Also
worth
visiting
are
the
Igreja
Matriz
(SÃ£o
Clemente)
13th-century
Gothic
church
with
18th-century
azulejo
tiles;
the
Convento
da
GraÃ§a
with
terrific
Manueline
portal;
and
Ermida
de
Nossa
Senhora
da
ConceiÃ§Ã£o
small
church
prized
for
its
Baroque
altar
and
ceramic
tiles
In
the
streets
directly
below
the
castle
walls
you
may
well
hear
the
sounds
of
craftsmen
beating
copperÂ âÂ from
whom
you
can
buy
direct
You
can
also
see
artisans
at
work
on
the
pottery
wheel
producing
leather
goods
(such
as
decorated
saddles
and
bridles)
and
furniture
The
craftsmen
of
LoulÃ©
are
said
to
be
the
descendants
of
community
of
Muslims
who
found
refuge
in
the
district
at
the
end
of
the
Reconquest
If
you
are
in
the
Algarve
in
springtime
donât
miss
the
LoulÃ©
Carnival
The
parades
âBattle
of
Flowers,â
and
musical
celebrations
are
the
best
of
their
kind
in
the
region
The
flower-lined
road
from
LoulÃ©
to
SÃ£o
BrÃ¡s
de
Alportel
another
market
town
and
site
of
one
of
only
two
government
pousadas
(inns)
along
the
Algarve
passes
through
rolling
orchards
of
fig
olive
and
orange
trees
Itâs
best
to
visit
the
town
on
Saturday
when
the
lively
market
transforms
its
otherwise
sleepy
character
You
may
wish
to
pay
visit
to
the
charming
Museu
EtnogrÃ¡fico
do
Trajo
AlgÃ¡rvio
(Museum
of
Algarvian
Costumes)
where
exhibits
of
local
dress
are
well
staged
in
large
old
house
90
(100
yards)
or
so
off
the
main
square
In
this
northern
part
of
the
southern
province
life
is
visibly
slower
and
more
rustic;
bonneted
ladies
in
black
walk
along
the
roadside
old
men
bounce
up
and
down
on
donkeys
and
families
pluck
almonds
from
the
trees
with
long
sticks
On
the
road
toward
Faro
is
pair
of
historical
sights
The
PalÃ¡cio
de
EstÃ³i
is
most
curious
find
The
charming
Rococo
palace
found
through
small
side
gate
just
to
the
left
of
the
church
steps
in
the
town
center
once
belonged
to
the
Dukes
of
EstÃ³i
Begun
in
the
mid-18th
century
in
palatial
terms
itâs
rather
small
abandoned
and
visibly
dilapidated
and
only
the
gardens
are
open
to
the
public
Yet
it
is
spectacular
sight
Its
faded
glory
includes
balustrade
terraces
and
staircases
with
splendid
bursts
of
bougainvillea
busts
of
historic
characters
impaled
on
the
parapets
brightly
colored
wall
tiles
and
formal
gardens
The
palace
and
gardens
have
been
acquired
by
the
Portuguese
government
which
aims
to
construct
pousada
(inn)
here
If
and
when
that
project
is
completed
it
should
become
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
the
entire
chain
The
dusty
Villa
Romana
de
Milreu
(Roman
ruins
of
Milreu)
is
1.5km
(1
mile)
down
the
road
from
the
village
toward
Faro
(a
small
sign
on
the
side
of
the
road
reads
âRuinas
de
Milreuâ)
Some
1,400
years
before
the
Palace
of
EstÃ³i
was
erected
Milreu
was
also
the
large
country
house
of
an
eminent
person
The
knee-high
walls
that
trace
the
outline
of
this
once
luxury
establishment
are
still
clearly
visible
The
tall
semi-circular
tower
ruin
is
thought
to
have
been
temple
to
pagan
water
gods
at
one
time;
however
by
the
fifth
century
it
had
clearly
been
converted
to
church
FARO
Faro
the
provincial
capital
of
the
Algarve
is
also
the
one
that
seems
to
get
the
least
respect
from
tourists
Many
fly
into
Faro
beeline
directly
to
their
resorts
and
return
two
weeks
later
bypassing
the
city
for
the
airport
Those
who
take
the
timeÂ âÂ a
day
is
sufficientÂ âÂ to
explore
Faro
find
an
atmosphere
quite
distinct
from
the
resort-heavy
coast
Faro
has
greater
wealth
of
cultural
and
historic
monuments
than
any
other
Algarvian
town
picturesque
old
quarter
and
best
of
all
tourists
never
overrun
authentic
Portuguese
restaurants
cafÃ©s
and
bars
Faro
was
always
an
important
town
even
during
Roman
times
when
it
was
allowed
to
coin
its
own
money
It
continued
to
thrive
under
the
Arabs;
its
name
may
be
derived
from
the
name
Harune
one
of
the
old
cityâs
ruling
families
The
Christians
recaptured
Faro
in
1249
completing
the
Reconquest
and
the
city
prospered
becoming
the
Episcopal
see
of
the
Bishop
of
the
Algarve
in
1577
But
in
1596
when
it
was
Spanish
territory
an
English
fleet
commanded
by
Queen
Elizabeth
Iâs
favorite
the
Earl
of
Essex
sacked
and
burned
the
capital
Until
comparatively
recently
when
the
area
silted
into
tidal
flat
Faro
was
commercial
and
fishing
port
open
to
the
Atlantic
Indeed
the
Earl
of
Essexâs
fleet
had
sailed
right
up
to
the
cityâs
Arab
fortifications
Today
small
fishing
boats
and
pleasure
craft
must
zigzag
carefully
amid
the
dunes
and
then
creep
beneath
the
railway
bridge
to
enter
the
sleepy
harbor
The
main
entrance
to
the
circular
old
town
near
the
harbor
is
the
19th-century
Arco
da
Vila
charming
arch
and
bell
tower
habitually
crowned
by
venerable
family
of
nesting
storks
Beyond
the
arch
cobbled
street
worn
slick
by
centuries
of
tramping
feet
leads
up
to
the
splendid
expanse
of
the
Largo
da
SÃ©
(Cathedral
Square)
best
seen
in
the
evening
when
floodlit
and
free
of
cars
The
SÃ©âs
unusual
cathedral
tower
main
portico
and
two
interior
chapels
are
all
that
remain
of
the
original
13th-century
Gothic
building
Inside
are
some
fine
examples
of
azulejos
and
superb
statues
and
carvings
one
of
the
Algarveâs
top
collections
of
17th-
and
18th-century
sacred
art
Climb
the
tower
for
fine
views
over
the
whole
of
Faro
At
last
visit
the
cathedral
was
undergoing
massive
restoration
project
both
inside
and
out
as
it
has
since
it
was
attacked
by
the
English
and
later
damaged
by
the
great
earthquake
Until
that
project
is
finished
entrance
is
through
side
door
Across
the
square
is
the
Sede
Episcopal
(Episcopal
Palace)
an
excellent
example
of
the
plain
chÃ£
style
prevalent
during
the
17th
century
To
its
right
is
the
CÃ¢mara
Municipal
(Town
Hall)
The
Convento
de
Nossa
Senhora
da
AssunÃ§Ã£o
(Convent
of
Our
Lady
of
the
Assumption)
which
contains
the
most
beautiful
cloister
in
southern
Portugal
The
first
Renaissance
building
in
the
Algarve
it
was
constructed
in
the
16th
century
on
the
site
of
the
old
Jewish
quarter
(Faro
had
sizeable
Jewish
population
in
the
Middle
Ages)
Abandoned
as
convent
in
the
19th
century
and
then
put
to
improbable
use
as
cork
factory
it
has
now
been
beautifully
restored
as
museum
devoted
to
archaeology
the
Museu
ArqueolÃ³gico
Infante
Dom
Henrique
The
principal
exhibit
is
2,000-year-old
Roman
floor
mosaic
measuring
(30
ft)
long
and
(10
ft)
wide
Unearthed
in
Faro
it
is
nicknamed
the
âOcean
Mosaic,â
for
it
depicts
bearded
sea-god
(though
the
bulldozer
that
discovered
it
in
1976
shaved
off
the
lower
half
of
his
face)
There
are
also
busts
taken
from
the
Roman
ruins
at
Milreu
Displays
of
Portuguese
art
are
housed
in
the
many
rooms
off
the
cloister
Nearby
is
the
Ermida
de
Nossa
Senhora
do
Repouso
(Hermitage
of
Our
Lady
of
Rest)
tiny
18th-century
chapel
carved
out
of
the
ancient
Moorish
arches
The
real
attraction
of
Faroâs
old
town
however
is
not
its
set-piece
buildings
but
the
quiet
hidden
timeless
flavor
of
its
tiny
houses
and
narrow
cobbled
alleyways
good
place
to
sit
and
absorb
some
of
it
is
the
friendly
CafÃ©
do
Largo
where
classical
music
accompanies
your
coffee
Just
outside
the
old
quarter
is
the
Igreja
de
SÃ£o
Francisco
(Church
of
the
Third
Order
of
St
Francis)
begun
in
the
late
17th
century
Narrative
tiles
adorn
the
main
chapel
and
vaulted
ceiling
which
displays
terrific
panel
of
the
Coronation
of
the
Virgin
Mary
In
the
center
of
town
across
from
the
harbor
the
cobbled
and
shaded
municipal
Jardim
Manuel
BÃ­var
created
in
the
15th
century
as
the
Queenâs
Square
is
popular
meeting
place
for
young
and
old
alike
In
its
center
are
an
open-air
cafÃ©
and
an
old-fashioned
bandstand
Several
handsome
16thâ18th-century
mansions
surround
the
square
including
the
Banco
de
Portugal
building
and
the
PalÃ¡cio
BelmarÃ§o
As
in
several
other
Algarve
towns
the
main
shopping
area
of
central
Faro
is
pedestrian-only
and
cafÃ©s
and
restaurants
spill
out
onto
the
street
fish
displays
and
all
Rua
de
Santo
AntÃ³nio
is
the
main
thoroughfare
At
its
far
end
is
the
Museu
EtnogrÃ¡fico
(Ethnographic
Museum)
with
displays
of
local
handicrafts
reconstructions
of
rooms
in
typical
Algarvian
house
and
colorful
water-cart
that
Manuel
Ignacio
Miguel
of
OlhÃ£o
operated
for
60
years
almost
up
to
his
death
in
1974
The
museum
sits
on
the
edge
of
Faroâs
Mouraria
or
old
Moorish
quarter
Itâs
worth
wandering
the
streets
that
lead
to
Largo
do
PÃ©
da
Cruz
and
the
attractive
little
17th-century
chapel
of
the
same
name
(Our
Lady
of
the
Foot
of
the
Cross)
The
new
town
an
expansion
dating
from
the
19th
century
is
west
of
here
Two
churches
which
face
each
other
across
large
and
congested
plaza
are
worth
seeing
The
Igreja
de
SÃ£o
Pedro
(Church
of
St
Peter)
is
the
smaller
of
the
two
built
in
the
16th
century
It
has
carved
Baroque
retable
and
couple
of
Rococo
chapels
But
Faroâs
finest
church
is
Igreja
do
Carmo
(Carmelite
Church)
which
took
most
of
the
18th
century
to
build
The
promise
of
its
twin
belltowers
and
stately
faÃ§ade
is
matched
by
beautiful
gilded
interior
but
the
greatest
attraction
is
the
macabre
Capela
dos
Ossos
(Chapel
of
Bones)
This
19th-century
curiosity
like
similar
chapel
in
the
town
of
Ãvora
farther
north
is
constructed
of
the
skulls
and
bones
of
monks
unearthed
from
the
friarsâ
cemetery
Depending
on
your
tolerance
for
such
things
it
is
either
fascinating
or
sick
beyond
belief
Less
ghastly
is
the
Jewish
Cemetery
on
the
outskirts
of
town
(off
Rua
LeÃ£o
Penedo
near
PraÃ§a
dos
Bomberos
de
Faro)
Dating
to
the
early
19th
century
it
has
more
than
one
hundred
tombstones
in
Hebrew
testimony
to
the
once-important
Jewish
community
in
Faro
Few
people
seem
to
do
it
but
it
is
well
worth
spending
night
or
two
in
Faro
especially
if
youâve
already
spent
some
time
in
traditional
Algarvian
beach
resort
Watch
the
sun
setting
over
the
fishing
boats
in
the
lagoon
while
you
have
drink
in
the
splendidly
old-fashioned
cavernous
CafÃ©
AlianÃ§a
the
cityâs
oldest
cafÃ©
Faro
also
has
some
lively
music
bars
Faroâs
beach
the
Praia
de
Faro
is
noted
for
its
watersports
You
can
drive
there
across
the
single-lane
causeway
linking
the
long
strip
of
dunes
with
the
mainland
(no
buses
or
motor
homes
allowed)
or
in
the
summer
catch
ferry
from
the
pier
by
the
old
town
If
the
ocean
is
rough
simply
cross
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
sand
spit
and
swim
in
the
calm
warmer
waters
of
the
lagoon
(though
be
aware
it
can
sometimes
be
muddy
and
little
unpleasant)
The
Sotavento
Coast
Heading
east
from
the
provincial
capital
of
Faro
the
first
settlement
of
any
size
you
will
come
to
is
the
colorful
fishing
town
of
OlhÃ£o
working
port
it
has
made
few
concessions
to
tourism
and
is
full
of
character
OlhÃ£o
has
often
been
described
as
the
âlittle
white
Cubist
town
of
the
Algarve,â
its
architecture
likened
to
that
of
North
African
towns
That
may
have
been
the
case
some
years
ago
but
modern
development
has
strongly
interfered
with
its
once
distinctive
appearance
You
can
judge
for
yourself
by
ascending
the
bell
tower
of
the
parish
church
(which
also
goes
by
the
name
of
Nossa
Senhora
do
RosÃ¡rio)
which
you
will
find
by
winding
your
way
through
the
narrow
streets
back
to
the
PraÃ§a
da
RestauraÃ§Ã£o
(you
may
have
to
ask
for
access
to
the
tower
in
the
sacristy)
Founded
by
King
Dom
Pedro
II
in
1698
the
church
has
an
impressive
scroll-decorated
Baroque
faÃ§ade
brilliant
white
dome
stone
belltower
and
chapel
at
the
rear
Nossa
Senhora
dos
Aflitos
(Our
Lady
of
the
Afflicted)
where
women
often
pray
when
their
fishermen
husbands
are
away
at
sea
Instead
of
the
red-tiled
roofs
and
filigreed
chimneys
seen
elsewhere
in
the
Algarve
the
OlhÃ£o
skyline
comprises
flat-topped
roofs
of
terraces
called
aÃ§oeitas
Look
hard
and
you
can
still
see
the
narrow
outside
staircases
leading
to
white-washed
towers
where
fishermenâs
wives
or
perhaps
smugglers
would
look
out
for
the
incoming
fleet
The
name
of
the
square
PraÃ§a
da
RestauraÃ§Ã£o
(âRestoration
Squareâ)
recalls
OlhÃ£oâs
most
glorious
moment
when
an
improvised
local
army
rebelled
against
Napoleonâs
occupying
forces
in
1808
This
insurrectionary
zeal
subsequently
spread
throughout
the
rest
of
Portugal
and
resulted
in
OlhÃ£o
being
awarded
the
title
âNoble
Town
of
the
Restoration.â
OlhÃ£oâs
fishing
port
is
worth
look
The
fishermen
of
the
town
have
reputation
for
hardinessÂ âÂ some
used
to
earn
living
in
cod
waters
as
far
off
as
Newfoundland
During
the
past
two
centuries
however
some
of
the
sailors
have
turned
away
from
fishing
and
instead
taken
to
the
cargo
trade
between
Portugal
and
North
Africa
This
relatively
recent
link
with
the
neighboring
continent
may
have
been
the
inspiration
for
the
local
North
African
style
of
architecture
In
any
case
it
developed
long
after
the
Moors
had
left
the
Algarve
Youâre
unlikely
to
see
boat
coming
in
from
another
continent
but
you
are
guaranteed
the
hustle
bustle
sights
smells
and
sounds
of
one
of
the
OlhÃ£o
fish
market
one
of
the
Algarveâs
best
(the
town
is
especially
famous
for
its
mussels
and
other
shellfish)
Adjacent
to
the
voluminous
market
buildings
are
small
well-tended
parks
one
of
which
boasts
several
splendid
benches
decorated
with
blue-and-white
azulejos
Just
beyond
the
park
on
the
other
side
ferryboats
depart
regularly
in
summer
for
the
barrier-island
beaches
of
Armona
and
Culatra
just
offshore
These
lovely
undeveloped
beaches
are
the
jewels
of
the
coastline
between
Faro
and
Tavira
little
farther
along
the
coast
at
Fuzeta
is
another
popular
beach
There
is
some
holiday
development
here
but
as
yet
only
on
small
scale
Fuseta
itself
is
little
more
than
creek
of
gaily-painted
boats
bobbing
at
anchor
while
in
the
background
local
workers
rake
salt
crystals
into
small
white
mountains
punctuating
the
saline
delta
Turn
inland
because
the
small
village
of
Moncarapacho
with
fine
old
church
sleepy
village
square
and
local
museum
is
well
worth
the
8-km
(5-mile)
detour
The
countryside
around
here
is
full
of
orange
and
almond
groves
and
as
you
head
east
(back
on
the
main
road)
towards
Tavira
olive
groves
and
vineyards
also
start
to
appear
Taviraâs
grapes
produce
good
rustic
wine
consumed
all
over
the
Algarve
East
Toward
Spain
After
the
salty
flavor
of
OlhÃ£o
and
the
rural
serenity
of
Moncarapacho
the
aristocratic
bearings
of
Tavira
one
of
the
true
gems
of
the
Algarve
may
come
as
something
of
surprise
One
of
the
regionâs
most
historic
cities
its
Moorish
Reconquista
and
Renaissance
roots
are
clearly
visible
In
the
1500s
Tavira
had
the
largest
population
on
the
Algarve
This
tuna-fishing
port
and
self-assured
town
of
historic
churches
imposing
classical-style
mansions
and
riverfront
gardens
probably
dates
back
as
far
as
the
Phoenicians
or
the
Carthaginians
In
fact
its
seven-arched
stone
bridge
of
Roman
origin
is
still
in
use
Taviraâs
castle
in
the
center
of
the
casco
histÃ³rico
(old
quarter)
was
defensive
structure
built
by
the
Moors
Climb
the
walls
for
superb
panoramic
view
of
the
city
but
be
careful
as
the
ramparts
have
no
guardrails
Within
the
walls
is
an
attractive
fragrant
garden
The
walls
look
directly
onto
the
Igreja
de
Santa
Maria
do
Castelo
(Church
of
St
Mary
of
the
Castle)
most
likely
built
on
the
site
of
the
old
mosque
The
Gothic
portal
is
the
only
original
13th-century
part
of
the
building
to
have
survived
the
devastating
1755
earthquake
In
the
chancel
is
the
large
tomb
of
Dom
Paio
Peres
Correia
who
drove
the
Moors
out
of
Tavira
in
1242
Across
the
square
the
ochre-colored
former
convent
Convento
da
GraÃ§a
is
being
converted
into
pousada
(inn)
by
the
Portuguese
government
Just
down
the
hill
off
Rua
Galeria
near
the
river
is
the
beautiful
16th-century
Igreja
da
MisericÃ³rdia
(Church
of
Mercy)
spectacular
Renaissance
edifice
The
carved
portico
is
especially
fine
with
statue
of
Our
Lady
of
Mercy
under
canopy
The
18th-century
interior
contains
excellent
specimens
of
carved
retables
and
tiles
There
are
at
least
two
dozen
other
churches
in
Tavira;
also
worth
visitÂ âÂ though
you
may
find
them
closedâÂ âÂ are
the
13th-century
Igreja
de
Santiago
(St
James
Church)
near
the
castle
walls
and
the
17th-century
Igreja
de
Sao
Paulo
(Church
of
St
Paul)
across
the
river
on
PraÃ§a
Dr
Padinha
The
church
part
of
former
monastery
has
unique
feature:
the
floor
of
the
transept
is
paved
with
bricks
and
stones
painted
with
Spanish
figures
Rua
da
Liberdade
Taviraâs
main
street
is
lined
with
stately
16th-century
mansions
walk
down
any
of
the
cityâs
old
streets
will
reveal
handsome
details
of
noble
houses
such
as
double
windows
and
latticed
doors
lively
fruit
and
vegetable
market
is
held
by
the
banks
of
the
River
GilÃ£o
and
it
is
well
worth
crossing
the
Roman
bridge
to
view
more
of
the
townâs
elegant
houses
and
pretty
flower-filled
squares
Many
of
those
houses
have
sloping
triangular
roofs
called
tesouros
(treasures)
nice
excursion
from
Tavira
is
to
the
nearby
island
Ilha
de
Tavira
where
there
is
huge
and
thoroughly
appealing
beach
backed
by
sand
dunes
Jetties
leave
from
point
Quatro
Ãguas
couple
of
km
(one
mile)
east
of
town
Back
on
the
mainland
turn-off
of
the
main
road
east
(EN-125
still!)
of
Tavira
leads
small
number
of
visitors
to
perfectly
enchanting
little
whitewashed
village
overlooking
the
sea
Pretty
Cacela
Velha
canât
have
more
than
100
inhabitants
It
has
an
18th-century
church
telephone
booth
cemetery
an
old
well
and
handful
of
well-tended
blue-and-white
houses
festooned
with
flowers
Below
the
town
along
spit
of
sand
thatâs
part
of
the
Ria
(estuary)
are
few
moored
fishing
boats
East
of
here
lies
the
fledgling
resort
of
Manta
Rota
former
fishing
village
and
the
high-rise
canyons
of
Monte
Gordo
The
reason
behind
all
this
development
is
long
sandy
beach
which
stretches
undisturbed
for
some
10
km
(6
miles)
between
the
two
resorts
and
is
backed
by
pine
trees
and
dunes
Although
the
last
in
long
line
of
Algarve
beach
resorts
(or
the
first
if
youâre
coming
from
Spain)
is
not
by
long
shot
the
coastâs
most
attractive
the
beach
and
watersports
facilities
at
Monte
Gordo
are
enough
to
attract
and
entertain
many
serious
sun-seekers
By
night
the
casino
is
the
focus
of
attention
The
Guadiana
River
which
runs
into
the
Atlantic
km
(2
miles)
east
of
Monte
Gordo
served
as
natural
frontier
for
2,000
years
forming
the
boundary
between
the
Roman
provinces
of
Lusitania
(Portugal)
and
Baetica
(southern
Spain)
This
explains
the
strategic
importance
of
Castro
Marim
former
fortress
town
rising
from
the
flatlands
to
command
the
broad
river
For
five
centuries
its
primitive
castle-fortress
was
occupied
by
the
Moors
After
the
Reconquest
it
became
the
home
of
the
new
Military
Order
of
Christ
(succeeding
the
disbanded
Knights
Templars)
Look
for
the
inscription
inside
the
main
entrance
proclaiming
that
Prince
Henry
the
Navigator
who
was
governor
of
the
order
once
lived
here
These
days
the
castle
itself
is
in
need
of
defense
and
restoration
and
although
it
may
no
longer
be
of
any
military
value
its
broad
unpolluted
marshlands
do
attract
large
numbers
of
wading
birds
The
area
is
protected
by
the
National
Parks
service
and
is
very
popular
with
birdwatchers
little
to
the
south
the
town
of
Vila
Real
de
Santo
AntÃ³nio
(the
Royal
Town
of
St
Anthony)
is
the
last
of
the
Algarveâs
beach
towns
before
Spain
The
city
was
designed
to
be
as
grand
as
its
name
suggests
in
order
to
impress
the
Spanish
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
The
town
plan
was
the
inspiration
of
the
MarquÃªs
of
Pombal
the
dynamic
hatchet
man
of
King
JosÃ©
I
and
the
town
was
built
from
scratch
in
just
five
months
in
1774
aping
the
grid
layout
of
Lisbonâs
Baixa
(lower
city)
The
town
square
PraÃ§a
do
MarquÃªs
do
Pombal
is
the
work
of
the
royal
architect
and
the
tour
de
force
of
Vila
Real
The
pavementâs
black
and
white
wedges
of
stone
radiate
from
an
obelisk
in
the
center
of
the
square
like
rays
from
the
sun
Distinguished
three-story
late
18th-century
houses
line
the
square
and
orange
trees
soften
the
edges
adding
color
and
scent
Visit
the
small
Manuel
Cabanas
Museum
just
off
the
square
to
see
nice
collection
of
woodcuts
that
ranges
from
rustic
scenes
to
famous
statesmen
and
composers
Today
Vila
Real
is
sleepy
but
quietly
dignified
walk
around
the
old
quarter
reveals
number
of
fine
brightly
painted
houses
along
pedestrian-only
streets
Vila
Real
de
Santo
AntÃ³nioâs
main
appeal
is
as
the
ferry
port
to
Ayamonte
across
the
water
in
Spain
The
trip
takes
just
20
minutesÂ âÂ less
time
than
it
would
take
to
drive
to
and
over
the
new
bridgeÂ âÂ and
the
white
town
of
Ayamonte
is
fine
sight
as
you
approach
it
from
the
river
Crossing
into
Spain
you
will
need
to
take
your
passport
Excursion
to
Lisbon
Until
the
19th
century
the
overland
journey
from
the
Algarve
to
Lisbon
Portugalâs
capital
city
took
week
or
more
Now
itâs
only
half
day
(or
even
less)
by
road
or
rail
and
you
can
fly
from
Faro
in
just
40
minutes
If
you
only
have
couple
of
days
to
spend
in
Lisbon
however
you
might
want
to
consider
an
all-inclusive
coach
excursion
from
the
coast
which
takes
care
of
accommodation
and
sightseeing
For
many
years
Lisbon
has
enjoyed
reputation
as
relatively
quiet
easy-going
sort
of
town
lacking
the
hustle
bustle
and
general
hassle
of
other
major
European
cities
But
while
this
is
still
true
to
degree
the
gap
is
now
closing
and
Lisbon
is
becoming
altogether
more
European
The
center
of
Lisbon
is
small
compact
and
easy
to
get
around
in
just
couple
of
days
Moreover
it
boasts
two
charming
old
quarters
as
full
of
character
as
any
place
in
Europe
If
you
have
more
than
two
days
it
is
well
worth
visiting
the
surrounding
region
The
popular
Estoril
coast
including
Cascais
and
the
beautiful
hilltop
town
of
Sintra
are
two
of
the
most
popular
excursions
Exploring
Lisbon
The
city
is
built
on
hillsÂ âÂ by
legend
seven
in
fact
many
moreÂ âÂ but
the
great
thing
for
the
visitor
is
the
splendid
vantage
points
and
lookouts
that
these
provide
The
best
place
to
start
your
tour
of
Lisbon
is
from
the
Moorsâ
old
castle
the
Castelo
de
SÃ£o
Jorge
the
king
of
all
vantage
points
From
here
you
can
look
out
over
the
whole
of
the
city
and
along
the
broad
Rio
Tejo
(River
Tagus)
spanned
by
the
longest
suspension
bridge
in
Europe
The
castle
is
set
just
above
Lisbonâs
most
famous
bairro
(district)
the
Alfama
Here
you
will
discover
labyrinth
of
narrow
crooked
streets
cobbled
alleyways
decaying
old
houses
former
palaces
fish
stalls
and
bars
totally
unknown
to
tourists
Little
has
changed
here
in
decades
if
not
centuries
Another
majestic
view
of
the
city
is
from
the
charming
park
Miradouro
de
Santa
Luzia
just
down
the
hill
from
the
castle
Close
by
is
the
SÃ©
(Cathedral)
which
has
an
ancient
cavernous
interiorÂ âÂ one
of
perhaps
dozen
first-class
churches
in
the
city
Adjacent
to
the
cathedral
is
the
lovely
Igreja
de
Santo
AntÃ³nio
da
SÃ©
named
for
Lisbonâs
patron
saint
St
Anthony
of
Padua
Just
beyond
the
dense
quarters
of
the
Alfama
is
SÃ£o
Vicente
de
Fora
(St
Vincent
Beyond
the
Walls)
an
Italianate
church
and
monastic
cloister
The
latter
is
the
true
highlight:
its
courtyards
are
lined
with
blue-and-white
azulejos
and
the
views
from
the
roof
are
among
the
best
in
the
city
Down
toward
the
river
is
the
Museu
Nacional
do
Azulejo
(National
Azulejo
Museum)
devoted
entirely
to
the
art
of
painted
and
glazed
ceramic
tiles
national
art
form
About
12,000
azulejos
are
on
show
here
from
15th-century
polychrome
designs
to
20th-century
art
deco
prized
possession
is
the
Lisbon
Panorama
36m-
(118ft-)
long
tile
composition
of
Lisbonâs
riverside
as
it
looked
before
the
1755
earthquake
Like
Alfama
the
Bairro
Alto
(upper
city)
is
hilly
area
full
of
evocative
houses
decorated
with
wrought-iron
balconies
usually
occupied
by
birdcages
and
flowerpots
At
night
the
district
is
loaded
with
exciting
atmosphere
and
is
famous
for
its
fado
clubs
Itâs
relatively
harmless
place
by
day
but
you
should
be
on
your
guard
if
visiting
after
dark
Perched
on
the
edge
of
the
Bairro
Alto
is
the
Igreja
do
Carmo
devastated
in
the
earthquake
of
1755
but
deliberately
preserved
as
an
atmospheric
ruin
and
potent
reminder
of
its
impact
Nearby
the
sumptuous
16th-century
Igreja
de
SÃ£o
Roque
features
small
museum
of
sacred
art
You
can
walk
to
this
area
easily
from
the
central
squares
but
itâs
also
fun
to
go
by
tram
or
instead
to
board
the
landmark
30-meter
(98-foot)
Elevador
de
Santa
Justa
which
youâll
find
just
off
the
Rossio
square
in
the
Baixa
the
lower
city
This
1902
Victorian
marvel
of
iron
and
glass
was
built
by
Raul
Mesnier
The
longer
slower
way
back
downhill
meanders
through
the
upmarket
shopping
area
of
Chiado
now
totally
rebuilt
after
1988
fire
that
swept
through
the
district
The
Baixa
is
Lisbonâs
principal
business
district
The
main
square
is
the
PraÃ§a
Dom
Pedro
IV
better
known
as
the
Rossio
Look
out
for
the
railway
station
EstaÃ§Ã£o
do
Rossio
which
looks
like
Moorish
palace
with
horseshoe
arches
just
west
of
the
square
Two
blocks
north
is
another
lively
square
PraÃ§a
dos
Restauradores
which
leads
to
the
leafy
main
thoroughfare
Avenida
da
Liberdade
The
city
plunges
steeply
downhill
to
the
River
Tagus
and
its
most
imposing
square
PraÃ§a
do
ComÃ©rcio
lined
on
three
sides
by
gracious
arcaded
buildings
and
vast
triumphal
arch
The
grand
square
wholly
wiped
out
by
the
great
earthquake
of
1755
has
seen
its
share
of
watershed
political
events:
King
Carlos
and
his
son
were
felled
by
assassinâs
bullets
in
the
praÃ§a
in
1908
and
one
of
the
first
uprisings
of
the
Carnation
Revolution
of
1974
was
staged
in
this
place
Moving
west
and
down
toward
the
river
from
PraÃ§a
do
ComÃ©rcio
is
the
elegant
residential
neighborhood
called
Lapa
Its
standout
sight
is
the
Museu
Nacional
de
Arte
Antiga
(National
Museum
of
Ancient
Art)
Portugalâs
largest
museum
Among
its
pieces
of
international
renown
are
The
Adoration
of
St
Vincent
multi-panel
work
attributed
to
the
15th-century
Portuguese
master
Nuno
GonÃ§alves;
and
The
Temptation
of
St
Anthony
fantastic
hallucination
by
Hieronymus
Bosch
tempered
with
humor
and
executed
with
mad
genius
Some
km
(4
miles)
west
of
PraÃ§a
do
ComÃ©rcio
lies
the
riverside
district
of
BelÃ©m
It
was
from
here
that
the
age
of
exploration
(begun
on
the
Algarve)
reached
its
zenith
between
1497
and
1499
when
Vasco
da
Gamaâs
voyage
to
India
opened
up
major
new
sea
route
During
the
following
century
Portugal
enjoyed
golden
age
of
trade
and
King
Manuel
celebrated
the
discoverers
with
two
magnificent
monuments
The
most
famous
is
the
small
but
exquisitely
formed
Torre
de
BelÃ©m
as
romantic
medieval
fortress
as
you
will
ever
see
(particularly
by
night
when
it
is
magically
floodlit)
By
contrast
the
majestic
Mosteiro
dos
JerÃ³nimos
is
Lisbonâs
largest
religious
monument
and
truly
formidable
example
of
Manueline
architecture
The
church
and
its
double-decker
cloister
survived
the
1755
earthquake
and
in
addition
to
royal
tombs
holds
the
relics
of
national
heroes
Vasco
da
Gama
and
the
poet
Luis
de
CamÃµes
The
monastery
houses
an
archaeology
museum
and
next
door
is
the
Museu
da
Marinha
(Naval
Museum)
Back
down
the
street
toward
Lisbon
is
the
highly
popular
Museu
Nacional
dos
Coches
(National
Coach
Museum)
which
is
located
in
the
former
riding
school
of
the
BelÃ©m
Royal
Palace
One
final
sight
in
BelÃ©m
is
the
modern
Monument
to
the
Discoverers
This
huge
splendid
waterfront
sculpture
depicts
Prince
Henry
the
Navigator
at
the
prow
of
stylized
caravel
that
juts
into
the
Tagus
River
The
figures
behind
represent
noted
explorers
map-makers
and
astronomers
whom
Prince
Henry
mobilized
in
order
to
launch
Portuguese
ships
into
the
history
books
Lisbonâs
newest
attraction
is
the
park
designed
for
the
World
Expo
â98
which
did
much
to
reinvigorate
the
industrial
eastern
section
of
the
city
Continuing
to
draw
visitors
to
the
riverfront
Parque
das
NaÃ§Ãµes
(Nations
Park)
is
its
world-class
aquarium
the
OceanÃ¡rio
de

perhaps
the
worldâs
top
aquarium
The
park
is

Estoril
Coast
Excursions
follow
the
coast
west
from
Lisbon
as
the
riverfront
evolves
into
series
of
Atlantic
Ocean
beaches
The
most
famous
is
Estoril
resort
about
24
km
(15
miles)
from
Lisbon
haven
for
deposed
European
royalty
in
the
first
half
of
this
century
it
retains
jet-set
image
with
Victorian
villas
and
modern
mansions
The
famous
casino
located
at
the
top
of
the
gardens
of
the
Parque
do
Estoril
combines
night-club
restaurants
bars
exhibition
hall
and
cinema
In
contrast
to
Estorilâs
pretentions
Cascais
is
an
agreeable
combination
of
fishing
port
residence
for
aristocrats
and
tourist
resort
Overlooking
the
main
swimming/fishing
beach
the
13th-century
citadel
is
one
of
the
few
buildings
to
have
survived
the

Queluz
An
easy
half-day
outing
is
to
Queluz
14
km
(8
miles)
west
of
Lisbon
on
the
way
to
Sintra
(see
below)
home
to
the
pretty
pink
palace
commissioned
by
Pedro
III
The
sumptuous
summer
home
was
built
in
the
second
half
of
the
18th
century
and
thrived
during
the
reign
of
Maria
(1777â1799)
The
interior
is
model
of
only
slightly
tattered
splendor
but
the
exquisite
Palace
Gardens
are
the
pride
of
Queluz
with
imaginative
fountains
and
armies
of
statues
Sintra
Finally
excursions
turn
inland
to
the
fetching
hill
town
of
Sintra
Since
the
14th
century
Portuguese
kings
have
made
the
PaÃ§o
da
Vila
the
royal
palace
in
the
center
of
town
their
summer
home
The
PalÃ¡cio
da

is
an
even
more
extraordinary
dwelling
Built
by
German
Baron
for
his

Where
to
Go
iewed
from
the
airÂ âÂ or
from
the
high
ground
of
the
Acropolis
or
Mount
LycabettusÂ âÂ Athens
is
sprawling
city;
maze
of
apartment
blocks
and
office
buildings
stretching
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
Yet
the
downtown
area
is
remarkably
compact
Most
of
the
major
sites
are
within
walking
distance
of
one
another
but
the
inexpensive
and
reliable
Metro
system
links
many
museums
and
attractions
for
those
who
get
little
foot
weary
Ancient
remains
are
scattered
across
the
central
downtown
area
and
Athens
has
grown
almost
organically
throughout
its
history
resulting
in
numerous
districts
each
with
its
own
particular
character
This
guide
divides
the
city
into
number
of
sections
covering
the
ancient
center
of
the
city
first
and
then
moving
clockwise
through
the
other
important
districts
Attractions

The
heart
of
ancient
Athens
was
centered
around
the
dome
of
the
Acropolis
with
sacred
temples
built
atop
the
rock
and
the
town
built
on
its
undulating
flanks
Today
the
area
is
still
replete
with
Greek
and
Roman
remains
though
these
are
interspersed
with
later
buildingsÂ âÂ a
fascinating
mixture
of
Neo-Classical
mansions
and
terraced
cottages
dating
back
to
Ottoman
times
This
area
known
as
Plaka
is
now
perhaps
the
most
charming
in
Athens
and
acts
as
magnet
to
visitors
from
around
the
world
The
Acropolis
It
is
impossible
to
overestimate
the
importance
of
the
Acropolis
to
the
ancient
Greeks
The
religious
significance
of
this
sheer-sided
rock
90
(300
ft)
above
the
town
was
paramount
and
the
enduring
images
of
the
temples
there
still
represent
the
principles
of
freedom
and
democracy
in
the
present
day
You
can
see
the
temples
from
most
parts
of
the
cityÂ âÂ particularly
at
night
when
they
are
well-litÂ âÂ which
only
adds
to
the
feeling
that
this
small
area
is
still
the
essence
of
the
city
The
name
Acropolis
derives
from
the
Greek
words
acro
meaning
âhighest
pointâ
and
polis
meaning
town
Try
to
visit
early
or
late
in
the
day
to
avoid
the
tour
groups
or
on
Mondays
when
most
tours
donât
operate;
and
remember
to
wear
comfortable
flat
shoes
as
there
are
many
slippery
stones
worn
smooth
over
the
centuries
and
numerous
uneven
areas
where
heels
can
catch
Once
through
the
ticket
office
path
leads
to
the
summit
of
the
AcropolisÂ âÂ a
relatively
flat
plateau
around
320
by
130
(1,049
ft
by
426
ft)
in
area
This
path
is
the
original
âsacred
way,â
used
for
ceremonial
entrances
to
the
inner
sanctum
in
ancient
times
Used
for
strategic
purposes
throughout
the
Mycenaean
and
Archaic
periods
the
rock
was
easy
to
defend;
it
had
water
supply
and
superb
views
of
the
surrounding
area
The
first
religious
structures
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
century
b.c.
when
the
summit
became
sanctuary
and
the
town
was
founded
on
lower
ground
below
These
early
temples
were
destroyed
by
the
Persian
forces
of
Xerxes
in
480
b.c
Following
this
new
defensive
walls
were
constructed
that
included
elements
of
the
ruined
old
Temple
of
Athena
and
the
old
Parthenon
It
was
during
the
era
of
Pericles
that
construction
began
on
many
of
the
buildings
that
we
see
today
He
commissioned
the
Parthenon
ErechtheÃ­on
Temple
of
Athena
Nike
and
Propylaia
taking
advantage
of
new
marble
quarry
on
Mount
PentelikonÂ âÂ the
marble
became
known
as
Pentelic
As
the
Romans
took
control
of
Athens
they
embellished
the
site
with
small
additions
but
the
wake
of
Christianity
and
the
decline
of
Roman
power
saw
the
Acropolis
vulnerable
to
attack
theft
and
vandalism
Statuary
was
removed
and
temples
were
used
as
palaces
by
European
nobles
during
the
14th
century
The
rock
reverted
to
its
earliest
use
as
strategic
stronghold
during
Ottoman
rule
resulting
in
damage
to
most
of
the
major
structures
Vast
amounts
of
stone
were
taken
from
temples
on
the
pinnacle
for
program
of
building
in
the
city
below
Following
Greek
independence
zealous
restoration
project
saw
the
removal
of
all
medieval
and
Ottoman
structures
on
the
plateau
and
harkened
the
beginning
of
archaeological
study
of
the
ancient
remains
This
continues
to
the
present
day
First
impressions
as
you
make
your
way
towards
the
inner
sanctuary
are
of
the
BeulÃ©
Gate
Roman
addition
of
the
third
century
a.d
The
path
leads
on
directly
in
front
of
the
Temple
of
Athena
Nike
to
the
Propylaia
(sacred
entranceway)
which
led
on
into
the
inner
sanctum
This
monumental
gateway
was
sign
of
things
to
come
and
for
the
ordinary
citizens
of
Athens
it
was
meant
to
inspire
and
impress
It
retains
this
ability
in
modern
times
even
though
the
structure
was
never
finished
Construction
began
in
437
b.c
to
plan
by
Mnisikles
an
otherwise
unknown
architect
series
of
six
Doric
columns
mark
the
transition
into
the
Propylaia
following
which
there
are
four
symmetrical
rooms
two
on
either
side
of
the
walkway
Ionic
colonnades
frame
the
walkway
(this
was
the
first
building
to
incorporate
both
styles
of
column)
There
were
five
heavy
wooden
doors
along
the
walkway
heightening
the
tension
of
those
ancient
pilgrims
as
each
would
be
opened
in
turn
The
only
room
to
have
been
completed
was
the
second
on
the
northern
side
This
was
used
as
waiting
room
and
also
according
to
the
Roman
historian
Pausanias
as
picture
gallery
or
Pinakotheke
the
name
it
holds
today
Once
through
the
Propylaia
the
sacred
way
leads
on
to
the
Acropolis
plateau
proper
In
Classical
times
(30
ft)
statue
of
Athena
Promachos
(the
Defender)
dedicated
to
Athenian
exploits
during
the
Persian
Wars
stood
immediately
beyond
the
entranceway
This
was
taken
to
Constantinople
during
the
Byzantine
era
Make
your
way
left
along
the
southern
flank
of
the
Propylaia
to
view
the
Temple
of
Athena
Nike
(Athena
of
Victory)
The
Acropolis
had
been
sanctuary
to
Athena
Nike
since
the
fifth
century
b.c
and
following
the
sacking
of
the
site
by
the
Persians
new
smaller
temple
or
naÃ¯skos
was
commissioned
and
designed
by
Callicrates
Six
elegant
columns
support
pediment
with
decorative
friezes
depicting
the
gods
on
Mount
Olympus
and
heroic
battle
scenes
of
Greek
warriors
fighting
barbarians
The
temple
built
on
the
remains
of
an
older
Mycenaean
wall
offers
excellent
views
across
the
surrounding
landscape
and
this
location
was
prized
by
the
Ottomans
who
tore
down
the
structure
to
build
defensive
battery
The
temple
has
been
painstakingly
re-erected
using
rubble
found
underneath
the
battery
when
it
was
removed
in
the
1830s
Walking
back
to
the
center
of
the
plateau
youâll
pass
scant
remains
of
the
Sanctuary
of
Artemis
Brauronia
founded
in
the
fourth
century
b.c.
but
your
eyes
will
be
drawn
to
the
immense
structure
of
the
Parthenon
which
dominates
todayâs
Acropolis
site
The
Parthenon
The
Parthenon
is
one
of
the
most
recognizable
buildings
in
the
world
The
series
of
columns
supporting
pediment
and
frieze
is
Athens
to
many
visitors
and
would
have
been
also
to
travelers
in
ancient
times
However
they
would
have
seen
structure
with
veneer
of
splendid
color
and
decorated
with
magnificently
carved
sculptures;
not
to
mention
strong
wooden
roof
now
lost
to
posterity
What
remains
is
the
bare
Pentelic
marble
used
in
the
construction
and
the
refined
lines
and
form
that
make
it
an
architectural
masterpiece
The
Parthenon
was
dedicated
to
Athena
and
means
Temple
of
the
VirginÂ âÂ Athena
in
her
guise
as
protector
of
the
city
goddess
of
wisdom
and
justice
It
also
housed
the
national
treasury
bringing
together
the
spiritual
and
secular
power
of
ancient
Greece
At
least
four
other
Parthenons
have
been
built
on
the
siteÂ âÂ in
fact
the
base
of
the
present
temple
indicates
that
its
predecessor
was
wider
Designed
by
architects
Callicrates
and
Iktinus
work
began
in
447
b.c
and
the
temple
was
dedicated
in
438
b.c
with
huge
celebration
the
Panathenaic
Festival
that
involved
thousands
of
people;
live
animals
were
sacrificed
at
an
altar
on
the
eastern
faÃ§ade
This
festival
then
took
place
every
four
years
during
the
Pagan
era
and
continued
until
the
fifth
century
a.d
(see
page
42)
Converted
into
church
in
the
sixth
century
the
cella
(inner
temple)
had
frescoes
painted
on
its
walls
and
upper
galleries
where
women
worshipped
bell
tower
was
added
by
the
Byzantines
who
named
it
Agia
Sophia
also
meaning
wisdom
Later
under
Ottoman
rule
the
bell
tower
became
minaret
and
the
church
was
converted
into
mosque
Eventually
it
was
used
as
powder
magazine
In
September
1687
Venetian
forces
threatened
Athens
and
one
of
their
mortars
hit
the
Parthenon
igniting
the
powder
inside
The
resulting
explosion
badly
damaged
the
structure
and
many
other
ancient
buildings
on
the
site
The
center
of
the
Parthenon
was
totally
destroyed
along
with
many
columns
and
priceless
carved
friezes
Subsequent
âlicencesâ
granted
by
the
Ottomans
to
European
nobles
saw
many
prize
friezes
disappear
to
archaeological
collections
around
Europe
including
the
Elgin
marbles
(ornately
carved
pediments)
that
were
taken
to
London
by
Lord
Elgin
Restoration
of
the
temple
has
been
almost
constant
since
1834
Today
it
is
not
possible
to
walk
among
the
columns
and
through
what
remains
of
the
inner
temple
This
echoes
the
rules
of
ancient
Greece
when
only
the
highest
priests
could
enter
the
cella
There
they
would
be
able
to
worship
an
ivory-and-
gold-covered
wooden
statue
of
Athena
said
to
be
12
(39
ft)
high
which
has
long
since
been
lost
Walk
around
the
70
(228
ft)
by

exterior
to
really
appreciate
the
grace
of
the
columns
There
are
no
straight
lines
anywhere
in
the
buildingÂ âÂ the
graduated
curves
simply
create
the
illusion
of
the
vertical
and
horizontal
To
the
north
of
the
Parthenon
stand
the
graceful
statues
of
the
Porch
of
the
Caryatids
which
adorn
the
southern
faÃ§ade
of
the
ErechtheÃ­on
This
temple
is
an
unusual
mÃ©lange
of
architectural
styles
with
rooms
at
varying
levels
where
the
worship
of
three
gods
took
place
It
was
the
last
of
the
great
building
flurry
of
Pericles
to
be
finished
dedicated
in
406
b.c
Built
beside
an
ancient
Temple
of
Athena
whose
scant
remains
can
just
be
seen
the
ErechtheÃ­on
brought
together
the
worship
of
Athena
and
Poseidon
under
one
roofÂ âÂ legend
says
that
following
the
contest
between
the
two
gods
for
the
honor
of
protecting
Athens
they
were
reconciled
and
this
dual
temple
recognized
their
special
bond
with
regard
to
the
city
ErechtheusÂ âÂ part
man
part
snakeÂ âÂ was
legendary
King
of
Athens
who
over
the
generations
became
closely
connected
with
Poseidon
temple
of
Zeus
also
forms
part
of
the
complex
The
temple
was
damaged
by
fire
almost
immediately
and
again
during
the
Roman
period
It
was
converted
into
church
in
the
sixth
century
a.d
and
was
used
as
harem
building
during
Ottoman
times
The
caryatidsÂ âÂ female
figures
used
as
pillarsÂ âÂ are
thought
to
represent
the
Arrephoroi
(maidens
who
attended
to
the
goddess
Athena
and
performed
rituals
in
the
sanctuary
and
the
temple)
as
they
all
originally
carried
libation
vessels
in
their
hands
Both
the
vessels
and
the
arms
of
the
caryatids
have
been
destroyed
The
sculptures
at
the
site
are
copies
with
all
but
one
of
the
originals
displayed
in
the
Acropolis
Museum
Their
portico
protected
the
tomb
of
Cecrops
the
mythical

of
Athens
Beyond

faÃ§ade
Here
row
of
Ionian
columns
mark
the
entrance
to
rectangular
inner
sanctum
of
the
new
Temple
of
Athena
The
walls
of
the
interior
were
removed
during
the
Byzantine
era
and
the
north
corner
(column
and
pediment)
was
removed
by
Elgin
and
taken
to
London
with
the

Porch
of

This
sits
on
high
foundations
as
the
ground
level
falls
steeply
on
the
northern
side
Much
of
the
building
here
dates
from
the
time
of
the
Roman
EmpireÂ âÂ a
devastating
fire
destroyed
the
earlier
temples
to
Zeus
and
Poseidon
Marks
on
the
ground
in
the
porch
area
suggest
that
this
building
was
once
struck
by
lightning
hole
was
left
in
the
ceiling
of
the
temple
since
the
belief
at
the
time
was
that
lightning
strike
should
never
be
closed
off
from
the
sky
Ancient
Greeks
believed
that
the
Acropolis
was
guarded
by
giant
snake
that
lived
under
this
temple
Pilgrims
would
buy
honey
cakes
for
this
snake
and
leave
them
at
the
temple
entrance
for
it
to
enjoy
The
west
wall
was
restored
in
the
early
20th
century
after
it
fell
down
in
1852
The
reconstruction
recreates
the
temple
of
the
Roman
era
The
Acropolis
Museum
in
the
southeast
corner
of
the
plateau
was
opened
in
1934
It
was
designed
and
built
so
as
not
to
spoil
the
skyline
or
compete
with
the
temples
and
it
cannot
be
seen
from
the
streets
of
the
city
or
from
the
sacred
way
as
you
enter
through
the
Propylaia
Much
of
the
fine
statuary
and
carved
friezes
still
present
when
Ottoman
forces
left
have
been
displayed
here
along
with
four
of
the
original
Caryatid
statues
from
the
ErechtheÃ­on
The
museum
displays
pieces
of
the
ornate
decorative
pediment
that
adorned
the
temples
and
dedications
to
Athena
herself
found
in
the
inner
sanctuary
The
whole
collection
is
breathtaking
and
proof
if
it
were
needed
of
the
immense
wealth
and
influence
of
this
ancient
site
Each
room
has
something
of
note

When
you
have
explored
the
architectural
delights
of
the
Acropolis
take
time
to
enjoy
the
views
from
its
walls
Sections
of
the
stone
defences
date
back
to
Mycenaean
times
though
the
majority
were
constructed
during
the
first
millennium
and
were
reinforced
by
the
Turks
From
the
north
you
can
take
in
the
other
major
archaeological
sites
and
the
district
of
Plaka
directly
below
From
the
east
the
verdant
slopes
of
Mount
Lycabettus
come
into
view
with
the
smart
district
of
Kolonaki
on
its
lower
slopes
South
leads
the
eye
towards
the
coast
and
the
islands
of
the
Saronic
Gulf
As
you
leave
the
site
via
the
smooth
stone
path
through
the
Propylaia
youâll
pass
the
Monument
of
Agrippa
Originally
erected
with
single
chariot
to
commemorate
victory
in
the
Panathenaic
Games
second
chariot
group
including
Marcus
Agrippa
was
added
in
27
b.c
Youâll
leave
through
the
BeulÃ©
Gate
remaining
part
of
the
Roman
defensive
system
Around
the
Acropolis
number
of
other
archaeological
remains
can
be
found
on
the
flanks
of
the
Acropolis
and
on
nearby
hills
Head
south
of
the
rock
by
taking
left
out
of
the
main
entrance
and
youâll
reach
the
first
after
five-minute
stroll
The
Odeon
of
Herodes
Atticus
was
one
of
the
last
great
building
projects
of
ancient
Athens
The
vast
auditorium
was
completed
towards
the
end
of
the
second
century
a.d
in
typical
Roman
style
During
Byzantine
times
it
was
used
as
dye
works
and
the
Ottomans
used
it
for
defensive
purposes
However
excavations
began
in
the
1850s
and
the
Odeon
is
once
again
holding
spectacular
summer
performances
On
the
southeastern
flank
of
the
Acropolis
are
the
vast
remains
of
the
Theatre
of
Dionysus
hacked
out
of
the
earth
in
the
fifth
century
b.c
and
upgraded
in
the
third
century
b.c
In
Roman
times
long
colonnaded
stoa
and
promenade
linked
the
two
theaters
but
only
scant
remains
can
be
seen
today
The
theater
(separate
fee
with
entrance
at
OdÃ³s
Thrasyllou)
was
the
birthplace
of
the
dramatic
and
comic
art
and
formed
the
social
and
political
heart
of
Athens
during
its
âgolden
age.â
The
premiers
of
several
major
pieces
by
Sophocles
Euripides
and
Aristophanes
were
performed
here
and
the
Athens
assembly
also
met
here
late
in
its
history
The
whole
auditorium
held
17,000
people
but
most
interesting
are
the
carved
front
row
thrones
for
VIPs
including
one
with
lionâs-claw
feet
that
was
reserved
for
the
priest
Dionysus
Eleutherios
The
particularly
fine
bema
of
Phaedros
(carved
stage)
depicting
scenes
from
the
life
DionysusÂ âÂ god
of
wine
and
merrimentÂ âÂ is
of
Roman
origin
Surrounding
the
theater
are
remains
of
several
other
buildings
including
an
Asclepieion
(place
of
healing)
and
Odeon
of
Pericles
These
are
currently
being
worked
on
by
archaeologists
To
the
west
of
the
Acropolis
stands
another
small
range
of
hills
now
cut
by
footpaths
and
covered
in
trees
offering
cooling
shade
in
the
heat
of
summer
This
area
reached
by
crossing
OdÃ³s
Rovertou
Gali
and
walking
up
behind
the
Dionysus
restaurant
offers
splendid
views
across
to
the
Acropolis
(itâs
the
best
place
for
afternoon
overviews)
and
the
Sound
and
Light
Show
auditorium
is
located
here
for
this
reason
Several
archaeological
sites
can
be
seen
and
the
area
is
much
less
crowded
than
the
Acropolis
itself
Youâll
also
see
the
16th
century
church
Ayios
DimÃ­trios
Loumbardhi
nestling
under
the
woodland
canopy
In
the
northeastern
area
youâll
come
to
the
Hill
of
the
Pnyx
meeting
place
of
the
Assembly
of
Athens
Loosely
translated
pnyx
means
âcrowded
or
tightly
packed
place,â
and
in
ancient
times
this
was
highly
populated
area
Youâll
see
the
outlines
of
walls
including
the
defensive
Themistoklean
Wall
between
the
bushes
or
under
the
turf
as
you
stroll
The
Pnyx
meeting
place
can
be
found
below
the
summit
on
the
northeastern
side
of
the
hill
When
democracy
was
established
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
century
b.c
the
debating
chamber
moved
from
the
Agora
to
this
structure
and
it
was
here
that
the
great
statesmen
of
Greece
made
their
speeches
at
the
rostrum
Seats
were
provided
for
the
5,000
citizens
of
the
city
needed
for
decision-making
quorum
who
would
listen
to
the
arguments
of
Pericles
and
Themistocles
On
the
Hill
of
the
Nymphs
north
of
the
Pnyx
youâll
see
the
Neo-Classical
lines
of
the
original
Athens
Observatory
founded
in
1842
Perhaps
the
most
popular
point
for
visitors
lies
in
the
south
where
at
the
highest
pointÂ âÂ Hill
of
the
Muses
or
Philopappos
HillÂ âÂ is
the
Tomb
of
Philopappos
high-ranking
nobleman
in
Roman
times
Its
convex
faÃ§ade
has
sculptured
frieze
depicting
Julius
Philopappos
riding
chariot
and
performing
his
duties
in
the
Senate
It
is
from
here
that
youâll
get
the
best
views
of
the
Acropolis
so
donât
forget
your
camera
or
video
recorder!
On
the
north
flank
of
the
Acropolis
is
the
hill
of
Areopagos
found
close
to
the
right
of
the
main
Acropolis
ticket
office
With
views
across
the
city
below
it
is
popular
spot
for
photographs
however
it
also
has
long
and
illustrious
history
Tradition
states
that
this
was
the
site
of
the
original
Agora
of
Athens
and
the
original
council
of
the
city
was
known
as
the
Council
of
Areopagos
Later
it
held
courts
of
law
and
justice
was
dispensed
here
In
a.d
51
St
Paul
addressed
crowd
of
Athenians
from
the
hill
with
his
sermons
of
Christian
faith
He
met
with
hostile
response
from
the
Pagan
population
but
did
convert
Dionysus
who
later
became
the
patron
saint
of
Athens
Plaka
and
Anafiotika
After
all
the
exploration
of
these
fascinating
archaeological
sites
youâll
probably
be
ready
for
rest
and
change
of
scenery
As
you
make
your
way
to
the
city
youâll
pass
through
two
small
districts
which
offer
range
of
cafÃ©s
bars
and
tavernas
along
with
images
of
Greek
daily
life
not
found
in
more
modern
parts
of
Athens
The
tiny
area
called
Anafiotika
hugs
the
high
ground
immediately
below
the
Acropolis
Built
in
the
19th
century
for
migrant
workers
from
around
Greece
that
came
to
take
advantage
of
construction
opportunities
in
the
capital
the
first
few
families
came
from
the
island
of
Anafi
and
wanted
to
create
surroundings
that
would
remind
them
of
home
Today
the
narrow
lanes
with
their
neat
whitewashed
cottages
and
plethora
of
potted
geraniums
are
still
reminiscent
of
the
Aegean
settlements
across
the
water
Plaka
lies
below
Anafiotika
and
fills
the
space
between
the
ancient
and
modern
city
stretching
to
OdÃ³s
Ermou
and
Syntagma
Square
to
the
north
This
was
the
center
of
population
from
Byzantine
times
through
to
Greek
independence
and
thus
can
be
called
Athens
Old
Town
The
maze
of
narrowÂ âÂ mostly
traffic-freeÂ âÂ streets
is
delight
to
explore
and
there
are
numerous
shops
and
eateries
to
choose
from
Playful
cats
dart
down
the
narrow
alleyways
and
you
may
be
lucky
to
hear
the
Terpsichordean
notes
of
the
laterna
drifting
through
the
streetsÂ âÂ these
hand-turned
barrel
organs
are
now
becoming
extremely
rare
Plaka
is
particularly
atmospheric
in
the
evenings
when
locals
enjoy
volta
or
stroll
before
dinner
and
tavernas
set
tables
out
on
the
narrow
side
streets
It
is
almost
living
museum
with
Byzantine
Churches
Neo-Classical
mansions
housing
galleries
or
collectibles
stores
and
wealth
of
historical
detail
at
every
turn
Do
look
beyond
the
tempting
shop
fronts
to
really
get
the
most
out
of
your
tour
Though
youâll
want
to
simply
follow
your
nose
around
the
district
here
are
the
locations
of
the
main
historical
attractions
of
Plaka
At
KidathinÃ©on
17
youâll
find
the
Museum
of
Greek
Folk
Art
which
offers
an
interesting
collection
of
embroidery
lace
and
numerous
liturgical
garments
Spinning
and
weaving
is
also
highlighted
along
with
traditional
puppets
and
festival
masks
and
costumes
The
collection
features
artifacts
from
all
over
Greece
and
her
islands
Other
divisions
of
the
folk
art
museum
can
be
found
around
the
city
On
the
southern
end
of
OdÃ³s
Adrianou
in
small
square
surrounded
by
cafÃ©s
is
the
Monument
of
Lysicrates
Dating
from
the
fourth
century
b.c.
it
consists
of
series
of
curved
panels
and
columns
creating
circular
structure
supporting
dome
made
from
single
block
of
Pentelic
marble
Originally
this
would
have
been
topped
by
bronze
tripodâÂ âÂ a
prize
awarded
in
choral
competitions
during
the
Classical
era
In
the
18th
century
Capuchin
monastery
occupied
land
all
around
the
monument
and
the
interior
of
the
base
was
used
as
guest
room
Lord
Byron
stayed
here
in
1810
and
is
said
to
have
written
some
of
his
work
while
enjoying
the
seclusion
One
mansion
on
OdÃ³s
PanÃ³s
high
up
near
the
Acropolis
has
been
turned
into
museum
The
KanellÃ³poulos
Museum
which
opened
in
1976
has
family
collection
of
artifacts
from
many
eras
of
Athensâ
history
Mycenaean
figurines
and
pottery
Classical
Greek
and
Roman
sculpture
and
Byzantine
icons
frescoes
and
tapestries
are
all
well-displayed
and
illustrate
very
effectively
the
varied
influences
that
make
up
the
history
of
the
city
To
the
Greek
and
Roman
Agoras
From
Plaka
there
are
numerous
streets
leading
northwest
towards
the
sites
of
the
Roman
and
Greek
Agoras
however
the
most
direct
route
is
via
OdÃ³s
Adrianou
Take
short
diversion
right
along
OdÃ³s
Paleologolou
to
explore
MitrÃ³polis
Cathedral
of
the
City
of
Athens
Built
in
the
1840s
following
Greek
independence
from
the
remains
of
over
70
churches
it
is
now
surrounded
by
network
of
supporting
scaffolding
erected
following
damage
sustained
in
the
1999
earthquake
The
cathedral
is
focus
for
prayer
particularly
to
the
Black
Madonna
surrounded
by
an
ornate
silver
frame
In
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
is
the
tiny
MikrÃ­
MitrÃ³polis
(Little
Cathedral)
officially
named
PanayÃ­a
GorgoepÃ­kos
and
sometimes
known
as
Ayios
ElefthÃ©rios
or
âfreedom
church,â
the
name
given
after
King
Otto
left
the
Greek
throne
Dating
from
the
12th
century
the
church
was
built
using
stone
from
the
ancient
sites
of
the
city
Wander
around
its
exterior
walls
to
see
sections
from
Greek
and
Roman
columns
or
fragments
of
ornate
pediments
NearbyÂ âÂ where
Mitropoleos
meets
PentelisÂ âÂ is
another
church
AyÃ­a
Dinamis
which
means
âthe
holy
power
of
the
Virgin.â
This
tiny
place
of
worship
has
survived
the
redevelopment
of
the
district
but
now
sits
literally
underneath
modern
office
block
When
Adrianou
meets
OdÃ³s
Eolou
it
is
cut
by
excavations
on
the
site
of
Hadrianâs
Library
(Adrianou
once
passed
directly
through
the
site
and
still
continues
on
the
other
side)
The
site
is
closed
to
the
public
but
can
easily
be
viewed
from
the
surrounding
streets
Built
in
a.d
123
only
the
western
wall
is
in
good
order
Turn
left
along
Eolou
to
find
the
site
of
the
Roman
Agora
Founded
in
the
first
century
a.d
to
accommodate
an
expanding
Athens
the
ornate
entrance
gate
was
commissioned
by
Julius
Caesar
in
honor
of
Athena
Archegetis
(Founder
of
the
City)
Much
of
the
north
and
west
wall
of
the
Agora
lies
unexcavated
under
the
houses
of
Plaka
but
the
south
wall
and
the
remains
of
the
south
colonnade
are
there
along
with
series
of
shops
near
the
ticket
office
The
most
remarkable
building
in
the
Agora
complex
(though
it
was
outside
the
Agora
when
built)
is
the
Tower
of
the
Winds
This
ornate
octagonal-shaped
structure
was
clock
and
meteorological
station
built
by
astronomer
Andronikos
in
the
first
century
b.c
Each
of
the
eight
faces
corresponds
to
cardinal
point
on
the
compass
and
is
decorated
with
an
ornate
frieze
depicting
the
wind
blowing
from
that
direction
The
timing
device
was
water-driven
with
supply
from
the
Acropolis
above
Just
beside
the
Agora
youâll
see
one
of
only
two
mosques
still
standing
in
the
cityÂ âÂ it
now
houses
an
archaeological
workshop
and
is
not
open
to
the
public
Nearby
on
OdÃ³s
Diogenous
is
the
Museum
of
Greek
Folk
Music
with
fascinating
collection
of
instruments
and
musical
recordings
bringing
the
varied
regional
folk
music
of
Greece
to
life
Continue
along
Adrianou
to
find
the
remains
of
the
Ancient
Greek
AgoraÂ âÂ birthplace
of
western
democracy
and
the
social
heart
of
the
ancient
city-state
of
Athens
(agora
comes
from
the
Greek
agiero
meaning
to
assemble)
From
the
sixth
century
b.c.
this
area
played
host
to
number
of
activities
including
religious
and
political
meetings
law
courts
education
shopping
or
simply
passing
the
time
of
day
Here
Socrates
regaled
the
people
with
his
philosophical
theoriesÂ âÂ unfortunately
for
him
he
fell
foul
of
the
authorities
and
was
put
to
death
in
403
b.c
St
Paul
met
an
audience
of
âskepticsâ
who
argued
against
him
when
he
gave
speech
here
in
a.d

The
whole
area
was
razed
during
Barbarian
attacks
in
the
centuries
following
the
fall
of
the
Roman
Empire
and
was
covered
with
new
buildings
during
Byzantine
times
all
of
which
had
to
be
cleared
when
excavations
began
From
the
entrance
at
Adrianou
(there
are
two
other
entrances
to
the
site)
look
immediately
to
your
right
to
see
remains
of
the
Altar
of
the
Twelve
Gods;
small
monument
from
where
distances
from
Athens
to
all
other
points
in
the
Greek
world
were
measured
This
was
truly
the
center
of
the
world
during
the
Classical
Greek
era
Directly
ahead
in
the
area
of
the
central
Agora
the
outline
of
the
Altar
of
Ares
and
Temple
of
Ares
can
be
seen
in
gravel
Behind
this
the
remains
of
the
Odeon
of
Agrippa
built
in
15
b.c.
and
the
Royal
Palace
overlaid
by
two
later
stoas
can
be
discerned
In
the
southeast
corner
of
the
site
the
11th
century
church
of
Ayios
Apostoloi
is
the
only
building
on
the
site
remaining
from
the
Byzantine
era
Greatly
changed
over
the
centuries
it
was
fully
restored
to
its
original
form
in
the
late
1950s
The
paintings
in
the
narthex
are
original;
others
were
transplanted
from
the
Hephaisteion
(see
below)
when
it
was
deconsecrated
To
the
right
facing
the
main
square
are
two
Bouleuterions
(council
chambers)
These
served
the
city
from
the
time
of
Kleisthenes
and
his
Council
of
500
in
the
late
fifth
century
b.c
Beyond
the
council
chambers
stands
the
best-preserved
temple
in
AthensÂ âÂ the
Hephaisteion
or
Temple
of
Hephaistos
also
known
as
the
Thisio
The
design
of
the
temple
is
classic
Doric
and
was
completed
after
the
Persian
invasions
Hephaistos
was
the
god
of
metalworking
and
this
temple
was
set
at
the
heart
of
the
smithing
and
ironmongery
district
of
the
city
Later
it
was
converted
into
church
with
the
addition
of
interior
walls
and
this
survived
through
Ottoman
timesÂ âÂ the
last
services
were
performed
in
the
1830s
For
some
years
following
it
served
as
the
first
archaeological
museum
in
Greece
The
exterior
of
the
temple
is
well-preserved
and
uses
the
same
curved
lines
as
the
Parthenon
though
the
columns
are
more
slender
and
the
entablature
(horizontal
platform
above
the
columns)
sturdier
The
metopes
(carved
space
on
Doric
frieze)
around
the
entablature
depict
the
legendary
feats
of
Heracles
and
Theseus
Surrounding
the
temple
is
garden
area
attempting
to
recreate
garden
that
existed
here
in
the
ancient
era
It
includes
the
same
plants
speciesÂ âÂ medicinal
and
herbalÂ âÂ that
were
popular
during
that
time
The
eastern
flank
of
the
Agora
site
is
dominated
by
the
Stoa
of
Attalos
First
erected
by
King
Attalos
of
Pergamon
and
opened
in
138
b.c.
it
was
faithfully
recreated
during
the
1950s
to
offer
us
stunning
vision
of
what
communal
buildings
were
like
in
ancient
times
Stoas
were
extremely
popular
in
the
Roman
era
and
all
large
settlements
had
one
These
long
porches
or
porticos
provided
shade
in
summer
and
shelter
in
winter
and
they
were
often
used
to
link
important
community
buildings
The
Stoa
of
Attalos
was
two-story
construction
with
rooms
at
the
back
that
housed
small
shops
Today
it
is
home
to
the
Agora
Museum
and
displays
numerous
artifacts
found
at
this
extensive
sight
Here
youâll
find
range
of
everyday
objects
not
seen
in
the
Acropolis
Museum
in
addition
to
religious
and
civic
statuary
and
mosaics
The
route
of
the
great
âsacred
wayâ
that
linked
the
Agora
with
the
Acropolis
aboveÂ âÂ and
that
was
used
during
the
Panathenaic
FestivalÂ âÂ is
now
being
excavated
and
rebuilt
to
allow
visitors
to
walk
in
the
footsteps
of
the
ancient
Athenians
MonastirÃ¡ki
and
Thissio
The
area
immediately
to
the
north
of
the
Greek
AgoraÂ âÂ âMonastirÃ¡kiÂ âÂ is
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
Athens
Under
the
Ottomans
it
held
the
main
market
and
despite
the
great
amount
of
archaeological
excavation
that
has
taken
place
since
the
1820s
it
still
retains
the
atmosphere
of
an
oriental
bazaar
Its
streets
are
full
of
small
trinket
shops
coffee
shops
and
bars
In
throwback
to
ancient
times
there
is
still
metalworking
and
blacksmith
area
that
produces
handmade
items
and
you
can
find
textiles
ceramics
and
copies
of
the
latest
âstreetwear.â
MonastirÃ¡ki
is
particularly
cosmopolitan
on
Sundays
when
huge
flea
market
fills
the
streets
and
you
can
haggle
over
furniture
and
knick-knacks
for
that
unique
remembrance
of
your
trip
The
district
centers
on
MonastirÃ¡ki
Square
(with
its
busy
Metro
station)
The
church
at
its
heartÂ âÂ the
PantÃ¡nassaÂ âÂ âis
thought
to
be
part
of
large
monastery
complex
that
sat
here
before
the
Ottoman
invasion
As
if
to
reiterate
this
historical
event
the
south
side
of
the
square
is
dominated
by
the
Mosque
of
TsistarÃ¡kis
built
in
1759
and
named
after
the
Ottoman
governor
of
the
time
It
now
houses
the
ceramics
branch
of
the
Museum
of
Greek
Folk
Art
The
main
thoroughfare
cutting
through
the
district
is
OdÃ³s
Ermou
which
leads
east
to
Syntagma
Square
(see
page
55)
Ermou
is
one
of
the
main
shopping
streets
of
the
city
and
numerous
European
retailers
have
outlets
here
small
square
cuts
its
path
just
little
way
from
MonastirÃ¡ki
Square
and
it
is
decorated
with
the
beautiful
Byzantine
church
of
KapnikarÃ©a
the
official
church
of
Athens
University
Built
in
the
11th
century
its
dome
is
supported
by
four
Roman
columns
and
its
modern
frescoes
were
created
in
the
1950s
by
Fotis
Kondoglou
KapnikarÃ©a
was
earmarked
for
demolition
in
the
1830s
but
was
saved
by
the
personal
intervention
of
Prince
Ludwig
of
Bavaria
father
of
Greeceâs
first
king
Weâll
take
the
route
west
from
MonastirÃ¡ki
Square
as
if
leaving
the
city
This
leads
us
one
kilometer
(.62
miles)
to
the
archaeological
site
of
KerameikÃ³s
As
you
walk
along
immediately
to
the
north
of
Ermou
(on
your
right)
is
the
district
of
PsirÃ­
Unspoiled
by
tourism
there
is
very
Greek
atmosphere
in
the
maze
of
narrow
streets
and
some
excellent
tavernas
among
its
traditional
shops
The
excavated
area
of
KerameikÃ³s
is
interesting
because
it
incorporates
section
of
the
478
b.c
city
wall
and
the
ceremonial
entranceways
into
Athens
from
the
cities
of
Eleusis
to
the
west
and
Piraeus
to
the
south
The
Panathenian
Festival
Procession
would
start
from
here
on
its
journey
to
the
Acropolis
and
the
procession
of
the
Eleusian
Mysteries
would
leave
from
here
through
the
Sacred
Gate
and
along
the
Sacred
Way
The
most
important
building
found
here
is
the
Pompeion
where
procession
paraphernalia
was
stored
and
where
those
involved
in
major
processions
would
ready
themselves
KerameikÃ³s
was
named
for
the
potters
who
worked
here
within
the
city
walls
(Inner
KerameikÃ³s)
directly
on
the
site
of
good
clay
deposits
Their
work
was
carried
around
the
Greek
empire
and
is
now
displayed
in
museums
worldwide
but
they
were
not
highly
regarded
by
citizens
in
ancient
times
Outside
the
wall
(Outer
KerameikÃ³s)
was
the
major
cemetery
of
the
city
(it
was
forbidden
to
bury
the
dead
within
the
city
walls)
with
burials
dating
from
the
12th
century
b.c
Major
figures
from
Greek
history
including
Pericles
were
buried
here
and
their
funerary
artifacts
are
some
of
the
most
exquisite
items
found
during
excavations
around
the
city
small
museum
has
burial
finds
dating
from
12thâsixth
centuries
b.c
but
youâll
see
many
more
in
the
National
Archaeological
Museum
For
those
whose
taste
leans
towards
post-industrial
landscapes
just
little
way
beyond
KerameikÃ³sÂ âÂ across
OdÃ³s
PireosÂ âÂ is
the
old
gas
works
of
Gazi
which
has
been
converted
into
the
Museum
of
Industrial
Architecture
It
also
hosts
regular
program
of
art
and
photography
exhibitions
Omonia
Square
(PlateÃa
OmÃ³nias)
From
MonastirÃ¡ki
Station
take
the
straight
thoroughfare
of
Athinas
to
Omonia
Square
(Omonia
means
Concord)
the
commercial
heart
of
the
modern
city
As
you
walk
youâll
pass
through
the
Municipal
Market
area
of
Athens
where
the
streets
buzz
with
constant
activity;
goods
spill
out
onto
walls
and
alleyways;
and
people
throng
the
sidewalks
The
market
operates
from
early
morning
to
mid
afternoon
Youâll
also
pass
PlateÃ­a
DimarkÃ­ou
also
known
as
PlateÃ­a
KotziÃ¡
where
youâll
find
several
fine
Neo-Classical
buildings
including
the
MelÃ¡
Mansion
(1884)
now
Bank
of
Greece
building
The
center
of
the
square
has
benefited
from
archaeological
exploration
during
the
1980s
and
Athens
Town
Hall
is
on
the
left
flank
as
you
almost
reach
Omonia
Square
The
rather
shabby
modern
buildings
belie
Omoniaâs
importance
Itâs
always
busy
with
people;
there
are
some
good
cafÃ©s
and
restaurants
and
some
of
the
most
prestigious
companies
have
offices
here
Combine
this
with
the
bus
and
Metro
routes
that
run
through
it
and
you
have
major
city
hub
The
National
Archaeological
Museum
ten-minute
walk
north
of
the
square
on
OdÃ³s
Patission
is
the
National
Archaeological
Museum
one
of
the
most
prestigious
archaeological
collections
in
the
world
Finds
cover
7,000
years
of
Greek
history
and
have
been
brought
from
sites
all
across
Greece
The
collection
brings
the
ancient
Greek
world
to
life
shedding
light
on
almost
every
aspect
of
the
daily
activities
of
the
citizens
Prepare
to
spend
at
least
two
hours
here
donât
try
and
rush
this
amazing
collection
The
map
of
the
museum
issued
with
your
ticket
will
be
great
help
in
finding
your
way
around
the
somewhat
confusing
array
of
rooms
and
corridors
You
are
sure
to
find
your
own
favorites
but
here
are
few
acknowledged
highlights
In
the
prehistoric
collection
(rooms
3â6)
enjoy
the
treasure-trove
found
at
Mycenae
including
the
exquisite
gold
Mask
of
Agamemnon
Schiemann
thought
that
this
was
placed
over
the
face
of
the
dead
King
Agamemnon
around
1200
b.c.
but
in
fact
it
dates
from
over
300
years
earlier;
the
prehistoric
rooms
also
have
collection
of
Cycladic
figures
dating
from
the
third
millennium
b.c
The
simple
rounded
female
figures
were
funerary
or
religious
objects
and
are
in
total
contrast
to
the
intricate
pediment
and
frieze
carvings
and
religious
statuary
found
at
temples
on
the
Acropolis
and
in
the
Acropolis
Museum
Youâll
also
see
rare
male
figure
among
the
collection
and
the
beautiful
Harp
PlayerÂ âÂ a
more
complex
carving
in
the
same
style
Rooms
7â35
concentrate
on
sculptureÂ âÂ perhaps
the
greatest
collection
of
ancient
sculpture
in
the
worldÂ âÂ and
these
are
displayed
to
show
the
chronological
development
of
the
art
form
Simply
styled
male
and
female
figures
(kouros
and
kore)
of
the
Achaiac
Age
(seventhâfifth
century
b.c.)
give
way
to
more
ornate
and
literal
human
forms
as
you
walk
through
the
collection
into
the
Classical
Age
and
then
on
to
the
Hellenistic
and
Roman
eras
Greek
gods
are
popular
themes
followed
by
eminent
human
figures
of
Roman
times
Room
holds
the
important
early
statue
of
Artemis
by
Nikandre
of
Naxos
(c640
b.c.)

The
diminutive
jockey
drives
on
the
handsome

as
if
about
to

including
the
Ptolemaic
period
when
Ptolemy
(a
general
under
Alexander
the
Great
and
therefore
of
Greek
descent)
took
control
of
Egypt
One
of
his
descendants
was
Cleopatra
perhaps
this
most
famous
ancient
queen

b.c
settlement
on
Santorini
in
the

The
frescoes
found
while
excavating
the
site
are
particularly
fine
and
offer
glimpse
into
world
lost
through
devastating
earthquake
around
1500
b.c
The
remaining
rooms
on
the
second
floorÂ âÂ 49â56Â âÂ feature
an
amazing
collection
of
pottery
and
miniature

to
the
epically
proportioned
artifacts
on
the

When
you
have
finished
your
tour
head
one
block
north
to
Pedion
Areos
large

created
in
the
1930s
where
you
can
enjoy
the
fresh

From
Omonia
to
Syntagma
Three
major
thoroughfares
run
parallel
between
Omonia
Square
and
nearby
Syntagma
Square
Stadhiou
is
perhaps
the
busiest
with
several
major
department
stores
and
high-class
stores
that
sell
jewelry
and
the
best
designer
names
plus
two
modern
stoas
packed
with
bookstores
When
you
reach
the
small
square
of
Klathmonos
youâll
find
the
Museum
of
the
City
of
Athens
housed
in
the
former
King
Ottoâs
palace
of
the
19th
century
Nearer
to
Syntagma
in
Koloktroni
Square
is
the
National
Historical
Museum
with
collection
of
artifacts
dating
from
post-Classical
times
This
is
useful
museum
to
visit
if
you
have
particular
interest
in
post-independence
Greece
as
many
artifacts
add
detail
to
the
individuals
and
incidents
that
shaped
the
new
country
Northeast
of
Stadhiou
is
Panepistimiou
(University
Street)
officially
named
EleftherÃ­a
VenizÃ©lou
after
the
Cretan
statesman
This
also
plays
host
to
several
important
buildings
The
National
Library
University
and
National
Academy
all
sit
here
confirming
it
as
the
academic
and
intellectual
heart
of
modern
Athens
All
three
are
Neo-Classical
in
design
and
made
of
Pentelic
marble
helping
to
give
feel
of
how
the
Agora
of
the
ancient
city
may
have
looked
at
its
prime
The
Academy
(1859)
is
perhaps
the
most
impressive
of
the
three
and
was
designed
by
Theophilus
HansenÂ âÂ pre-eminent
architect
of
his
generation
native
of
Denmark
Hansen
was
responsible
for
the
Zappion
and
Royal
Observatory
in
Athens
and
numerous
buildings
in
Vienna
Austria
The
seated
figures
of
Plato
and
Socrates
sit
guarding
the
Academy
entrance
and
an
intricately
carved
pediment
depicts
the
gods
and
goddesses
of
the
ancient
world;
these
were
sculpted
by
LeonÃ­das
DrÃ³sis
Come
and
look
at
these
carvings
through
binoculars
to
get
feel
of
how
richly
decorated
the
temples
and
communal
buildings
of
the
ancient
world
originally
were
Walking
towards
Syntagma
youâll
pass
the
Renaissance-style
house
of
Heinrich
Schliemann
that
most
famous
of
archaeologists
who
was
instrumental
in
turning
the
myth
of
the
Mycenaeans
and
the
Trojan
War
into
fact
The
outward-most
thoroughfare
is
Akadimias
which
runs
behind
the
Library
University
and
Academy
Opposite
these
buildings
youâll
find
the
Athens
Cultural
Center
housed
in
former
hospital
dating
from
the
1830s
There
are
auditoria
and
cultural
exhibitions
here
and
small
Theater
Museum
has
displays
charting
the
development
of
this
art
since
ancient
times
Syntagma
SquareÂ âÂ officially
Plateia
Syntagmatos
or
Constitution
SquareÂ âÂ is
perhaps
the
âemotionalâ
home
of
modern
Athens
It
is
dominated
by
the
imposing
faÃ§ade
of
the
Parliament
building
or
Vouli
which
was
built
as
the
new
royal
palace
following
independence
officially
opened
in
1836
The
use
of
Pentelic
marble
on
the
faÃ§ade
with
Doric-style
prolylaia
above
street
level
echoes
use
and
form
in
the
ancient
city
In
front
of
the
building
the
Memorial
of
the
Unknown
Soldier
commemorates
all
Greeks
who
have
fallen
in
war
Decorated
with
modern
carved
relief
of
Classical
theme
the
marble
is
inscribed
with
the
words
of
an
oration
by
Pericles
to
honor
the
dead
of
the
wars
of
the
PeloponneseÂ âÂ it
is
said
that
the
tombs
of
these
ancient
soldiers
lie
under
this
very
spot
The
tomb
is
guarded
day
and
night
by
the
ÃvzonesÂ âÂ traditionally
dressed
soldiers
who
became
Royal
Guards
and
then
presidential
guards
following
the
war
of
independence
The
formal
âchanging
of
the
guardâ
takes
place
every
Sunday
at
10:45am
however
the
members
of
the
Ãvzones
have
duty
switch
every
hour
during
the
day
when
two
new
guards
take
the
place
of
the
old
This
is
one
activity
that
you
shouldnât
miss
on
your
trip
to
Athens
The
Grande
Bretagne
Hotel
on
nearby
corner
of
the
square
was
built
in
1842
and
has
become
an
Athens
institution
during
its
lifetime
During
WWII
it
became
military
headquarters
of
both
the
Germans
and
the
British
Winston
Churchill
survived
bomb
attack
here
during
his
stay
in
December
1944
Surrounding
Syntagma
Numerous
major
thoroughfares
converge
on
Syntagma
so
itâs
always
busy
with
traffic
The
new
Metro
station
also
brings
steady
stream
of
people
Still
there
is
shade
and
flower
garden
in
the
middle
of
the
square
where
locals
and
visitors
alike
rendezvous
for
lunch
or
dinner
dates
Behind
the
Parliament
building
are
the
verdant
landscaped
grounds
of
the
National
Gardens
These
were
formerly
for
exclusive
use
of
the
Royal
Palace
but
now
form
an
oasis
within
the
city
with
formal
gardens
water
features
and
childrenâs
playground
In
the
south
of
the
garden
you
will
find
the
Zappion
Hall
an
imposing
Neo-Classical
building
designed
by
Hansen
as
National
Exhibition
Center
in
1888
It
now
houses
modern
conference
center
five-minute
stroll
from
Syntagma
down
Avenue
Amalias
(or
through
the
National
Gardens)
brings
you
to
another
ancient
site
At
the
confluence
of
Avenues
Amalias
Syngrou
and
Vas
Olgas
is
Hadrianâs
Gate
built
as
triumphal
arch
in
a.d
131
to
mark
the
divide
between
the
ancient
city
and
his
ânew
Athens.â
To
the
east
of
the
gate
is
the
Olympieion
site
of
the
largest
temple
ever
built
on
Greek
soil
The
Temple
of
Olympian
Zeus
is
dedicated
to
Zeus
âkingâ
of
the
Greek
gods
It
was
imperative
that
his
temple
should
be
fitting
for
his
position
and
its
dimensionsÂ âÂ 250
(814
ft)
long
and
130
(426
ft)
wide
with
columns
of
over
17
(61
ft)
in
heightÂ âÂ are
truly
majestic
The
temple
took
700
years
to
complete
and
it
was
Hadrian
who
finished
the
task
in
the
second
century
a.d
One
hundred
and
eight
columns
originally
surrounded
an
inner
sanctum
that
protected
gold-and-ivory
statue
of
Zeus
Today
only
15
are
still
standing
but
their
Corinthian
capitals
have
wonderful
form
and
elegance
In
ancient
times
the
temple
sat
close
to
the
banks
of
the
River
Ilissos
creating
an
even
more
beautiful
vista
Today
the
river
still
flows
but
its
path
lies
beneath
the
city
Nearby
along
Vas
Olgas
is
the
impressive
Olympic
Stadium
sitting
in
the
lea
of
Ardittou
Hill
The
stadium
was
constructed
for
the
ancient
Panathanaic
Games
when
each
of
the
surrounding
city-states
sent
delegations
to
compete
During
Roman
times
beast-baiting
also
took
place
here
Dating
from
the
third
century
b.c.
the
complex
was
refurbished
for
the
games
of
a.d
144
but
was
disused
and
left
to
decay
after
the
fall
of
the
empire
When
the
modern
Olympic
Games
were
convened
in
1896
the
stadium
was
refurbished
as
the
flagship
arena
and
today
it
stands
as
symbol
of
the
global
athletic
movement
Witness
the
heroic
statues
that
stand
in
the
entranceway
Athens
will
once
again
host
the
games
in
2004
but
the
central
athletic
complex
will
be
at
KifissiaÂ âÂ a
northern
suburb
linked
to
the
downtown
area
by
bus
and
Metro
Leading
directly
east
from
Syntagma
Square
is
Avenue
Vas
Sofias
This
main
thoroughfare
with
number
of
major
embassies
leads
to
several
important
museums
all
within
strolling
distance
or
close
to
the
Evangelismos
Metro
station
Closest
to
Syntagma
is
the
BenÃ¡ki
Museum
collection
donated
to
the
state
by
AndÃ³nis
BenÃ¡ki
on
his
death
in
1954
BenÃ¡ki
was
born
in
Greek
community
in
Egypt
and
many
of
the
artifacts
on
display
originate
from
this
other
ancient
land
though
there
is
good
range
of
Classical
and
Roman
statuary
and
collections
from
the
Early
Christian
and
Byzantine
eras
including
two
paintings
by
El
Greco
On
the
same
side
of
the
street
walking
away
from
Syntagma
is
the
Museum
of
Cycladic
and
Ancient
Art
run
under
the
auspices
of
the
GoulandrÃ­s
Foundation
This
museum
celebrates
the
art
dating
from
before
the
development
of
Athens
city-stateÂ âÂ discovered
in
the
Cyclades
islands
of
the
Aegean
(c2000â3000
b.c.)
wonderful
collection
of
naÃ¯ve
figurines
carved
in
marble
was
discovered
in
graves
on
the
islands
Most
of
the
figures
are
female
suggesting
the
worship
of
fertility
or
an
earth-mother
religion
Maps
and
drawings
help
visitors
better
understand
this
mysterious
ancient
people
In
addition
the
museum
shows
around
300
objects
dating
from
Classical
Hellenic
and
Roman
Greece
including
collection
of
finely
preserved
bronze
vessels
One
wing
of
the
museum
is
housed
in
beautiful
Neo-Classical
house
designed
by
Bavarian
architect
Ernst
Ziller
for
Othon
and
Athina
Stathatos
prominent
Athenian
couple
This
has
been
painstakingly
restored
and
presents
beautiful
street-side
faÃ§ade
Across
Avenue
Vas
Sofias
youâll
find
the
Byzantine
Museum
housed
in
splendid
19th-century
mansion
built
for
Sophie
de
Marbois
wife
of
one
of
Napoleonâs
generals
She
was
stalwart
of
Greek
nationalism
The
museum
holds
wealth
of
artifacts
from
the
early
Christian
and
Byzantine
eras
concentrating
on
the
religious
themes
that
were
so
important
in
unifying
the
Greek
world
at
this
time
The
collection
was
amassed
from
churches
all
across
Greece
and
Asia
Minor
(on
the
western
coast
of
modern-day
Turkey)
On
the
ground
floor
the
interiors
of
several
churches
of
differing
ages
have
been
reassembled
to
explain
the
development
of
architectural
stylesÂ Â âÂ very
useful
if
you
intend
to
visit
range
of
churches
during
your
stay
The
upper
floors
display
excellent
examples
of
icons
and
frescoes
vestments
and
other
religious
objects
Immediately
next
door
to
the
Byzantine
Museum
is
the
War
Museum
modern
building
constructed
during
the
military
dictatorship
Outside
youâll
see
range
of
fighter
jets
and
missiles
while
the
galleries
inside
display
historic
uniforms
armor
and
hand-held
weapons
Upper
floors
concentrate
on
military
tactics
and
battle
plans
examining
campaigns
from
ancient
times
to
WWII
Behind
Evangelismos
Metro
statio
and
next
door
to
the
Hilton
Hotel
is
the
National
Gallery
The
original
compilation
was
boosted
in
the
1880s
by
large
bequest
by
art
collector
AlÃ©xandros
SoÃºtzos
but
the
two
collections
were
only
brought
together
in
this
gallery
in
1976
Much
of
the
permanent
collection
comprises
19th-
and
20th-century
Greek
art
and
post-Byzantine
icons
though
you
can
also
find
works
by
El
Greco
Picasso
and
Delacroix
From
the
National
Gallery
it
is
just
short
walk
past
the
Hilton
Hotel
along
Vas
Sofias
to
the
Megaron
vast
new
national
auditorium
and
concert
hall
now
holding

Look
for
dramatic
modern
sculpture
in

depicting
human
figure
running
at
an
extremely
high
speed
(or
blown
by
the

that
graces
the
main
intersection
here
Lycabettus
and
Kolonaki
To
the
west
of
the
bare
sheer
rock
of
the
Acropolis
is
rival
hillÂ âÂ the
verdant
pine-clad
Lycabettus
which
makes
an
inviting
diversion
from
the
archaeological
sites
of
the
city
Here
youâll
be
able
to
sit
in
shade
and
listen
to
the
birds
The
hill
was
never
settled
in
ancient
times
because
there
was
no
water
supply
You
can
reach
the
upper
slopes
by
funicular
When
you
reach
the
top
station
walk
to
the
small
chapels
of
Ayios
Isidoros
and
Ayios
GeorgiosÂ âÂ center
of
the
Easter
celebrations
for
the
cityÂ âÂ a
modern
amphitheater
for
summer
performances
and
wonderful
views
across
Athens
where
major
attractions
are
pointed
out
on
marble
panoramas
Though
there
are
fixed
telescopes
here
having
your
own
binoculars
is
boon
to
really
take
in
the
detail
Surrounding
the
lower
slopes
of
Lycabettus
on
the
south
and
west
sides
is
Kolonaki
perhaps
the
most
fashionable
district
of
central
Athens
Apartments
and
houses
here
are
much
sought
after
as
they
sit
among
chic
boutiques
designer
stores
restaurants
and
bars
It
is
one
of
the
best
parts
of
the
city
to
eat
out
in
the
evening
with
range
of
good
international
eateries
in
addition
to
traditional
Greek
tavernas
Excursions
Thereâs
no
doubt
that
Athens
is
fascinating
city
but
with
the
rush
of
traffic
and
the
push
of
the
crowds
even
these
attractions
can
begin
to
pall
after
few
days
Luckily
you
are
perfectly
placed
to
take
in
numerous
excursions
for
the
day
or
few
daysÂ âÂ either
on
an
organized
itinerary
or
under
your
own
steam
This

Piraeus
Situated
only
10
km
(6
miles)
south
of
Athens
and
almost
indistinguishable
from
the
sprawling
capital
is
Piraeus
This
city
of
over
half
million
people
is
actually
the
third
largest
Metropolis
in
Greece
and
is
its
largest
port
Although
many
people
simply
use
Piraeus
as
departure
point
for
the
myriad
Greek
islands
of
the
Aegean
the
city
has
its
own
attractions
being
settled
since
ancient
times
This
was
not
the
port
that
served
the
city-state
of
Athens
because
it
could
not
be
seen
from
the
city
and
was
therefore
vulnerable
to
attack
It
was
first
settled
around
500
b.c
when
long
defensive
walls
were
built
from
Athens
to
the
sea
By
the
time
of
Philip
of
Macedon
it
had
become
thriving
commercial
port
Though
it
fell
into
decline
as
did
Athens
through
the
late
first
and
second
millennium
it
was
re-energized
following
independence
Its
location
so
close
to
the
new
capital
ensured
its
commercial
success
Today
Piraeus
is
above
all
working
city
with
some
less
than
prosperous
areas
Stay
on
the
main
thoroughfares
as
you
explore
Taking
the
Metro
(the
overland
electric
railway
section)
from
downtown
Athens
costs
only
250drs
and
brings
you
directly
to
the
waterside
Huge
quaysides
in
the
Main
Harbor
cater
to
hundreds
of
ferries
large
and
small
and
youâll
see
fleets
of
large
container
ships
laying
anchor
offshore
Walking
south
along
the
quaysides
brings
you
to
small
shady
square
with
the
Cathedral
of
Agia
Triada
on
its
northern
flank
Take
this
street
(Dimokratias)
to
the
Town
Hall
and
visit
the
lively
daily
market
that
takes
place
in
the
surrounding
streets
Take
right
down
Lampraki
to
reach
the
pretty
harbor
of
Zea
This
is
one
of
the
marinas
used
for
pleasure
craft
and
where
AtheniansÂ âÂ rich
and
not
so
richÂ âÂ moor
their
boats
These
range
from
simple
rowing
boats
of
just
few
feet
in
length
to
hundred-foot
ocean-going
vessels
wide
promenadeâÂ âÂ Akti

the
bay
and
this
is
where
local
people
come
to
stroll
in
the
evenings
and
on
weekendsÂ âÂ âyou
can
sit
at
portside
cafÃ©
and
watch
the
world
go
by
North
from
Zea
harbor
is
another
pretty
harbor
Mikrolimani
(Small
Harbor)
or
Tourkolimani
where
youâll
find
the
fishing
fleet
and
some
good
fish
tavernas
Or
head
south
towards
the
main
historical
attractions
of
Piraeus
From
the
south
side
of
Zea
harbor
it
is
only
short
walk
to
the
Archaeological
Museum
of
Piraeus
The
rather
dour
building
hides
treasure-trove
of
statuary
and
other
artifacts
found
during
excavation
of
the
ancient
shrines
of
the
city
and
communal
buildings
such
as
the

Corinth
and
the
Argolid
The
history
of
Ancient
Greece
is
littered
with
the
feats
of
city-states
led
by
great
leaders
of
which
Athens
is
of
course
the
most
famed
Within
dayâs
journey
of
the
capital
are
the
sites
of
two
such
city-states
in
an
area
known
as
the
Argolid
These
can
be
viewed
as
part
of
an
action-packed
day
(either
independently
or
as
part
of
an
organized
tour)
but
make
an
excellent
two-
or
three-day
excursion
for
those
who
want
to
take
it
at
more
gentle
pace
Corinth
In
ancient
times
Corinth
rivaled
Athens
in
its
power
and
influence
It
mimicked
the
layout
of
the
larger
cityÂ âÂ a
town
radiated
out
from
the
base
of
rocky
pinnacle
that
housed
religious
templesÂ âÂ though
at
Corinth
the
hill
is
much
higher
than
at
Athens
The
site
was
first
settled
by
Mycenaeans
because
it
had
an
excellent
natural
water
supply
and
it
reached
its
first
level
of
prosperity
around
the
seventh
century
b.c
It
became
Athensâ
enemy
when
it
sided
with
the
Spartans
during
the
devastating
wars
of
the
fourth
century
b.c
but
the
city
recovered
quickly
from
the
defeat
and
had
second
period
of
influence
that
began
during
the
third
century
b.c
when
Philip
of
Macedonia
made
it
the
capital
of
the
Corinthian
League
In
195
b.c
it
became
head
of
group
of
independent
Greek
cities
of
the
Achaean
League
Ravaged
by
the
Romans
in
170
b.c
it
rose
again
from
the
ashes
and
was
bustling
city
when
St
Paul
came
to
preach
here
He
won
more
support
than
in
Athens
and
planted
the
seeds
of
very
successful
early
Christian
church
Several
major
earthquakes
in
the
early
Christian
era
saw
the
cityâs
final
decline
Luckily
for
us
the
modern
city
of
Corinth
lies
several
kilometers
to
the
northeast
of
the
site
and
this
leaves
much
of
the
ancient
city
for
us
to
explore
Most
prominent
as
you
approach
the
site
is
the
Temple
of
Apollo
built
in
the
sixth
century
b.c
and
one
of
the
oldest
buildings
in
Corinth
Many
other
remains
date
from
the
Roman
era
including
ornate
entrances
round
the
Fountain
of
Peirene
where
you
can
still
hear
the
waters
flowing
through
caves
at
the
rear
and
the
Lechaion
Road
that
linked
the
city
to
AthensÂ âÂ with
worn
cart
tracks
clearly
visible
in
the
marble
slabs
The
site
museum
has
some
interesting
finds
and
has
number
of
dioramas
depicting
Corinth
as
it
would
once
have
looked
After
visiting
the
ancient
city
head
up
the
hill
to
take
in
the
magnificent
site
of
Acrocorinth
standing
sentinel
above
Fortified
since
the
seventh
century
b.c
the
summit
is
criss-crossed
with
miles
of
high
stone
walls
dating
from
this
time
that
were
expanded
during
the
Byzantine
and
Ottoman
eras
At
the
summit
within
three
layers
of
protective
wall
are
the
remains
of
Temple
of
Aphrodite
an
early
Christian
Basilica
Byzantine
cisterns
Frankish
Tower
and
Ottoman
mosques
and
fountainsÂ âÂ this
is
Greek
history
in
nutshell!
Though
the
modern
city
of
Corinth
has
little
to
draw
the
visitor
modern
engineering
marvel
lies
just
outside
its
boundary
The
Corinth
Canal
cuts
the
narrow
isthmus
that
links
the
Peloponnese
with
the
Greek
mainland
and
splits
the
Saronic
Gulf
from
the
Gulf
of
Corinth
(this
links
to
the
Adriatic
further
west)
Sailing
around
the
Peloponnese
to
Athens
not
only
added
extra
time
to
the
journey
but
also
carried
ships
through
some
of
the
most
dangerous
waters
in
the
MediterraneanÂ Â âÂ Â especially
in
the
winter
Ancient
Greeks
did
not
attempt
to
sail
around
but
portaged
their
huge
vessels
across
the
km
(4
mile)
wide
isthmus
and
as
early
as
a.d
67
the
Roman
Emperor
Nero
was
making
the
first
attempts
at
cutting
canal
It
would
not
become
reality
for
another
1,825
years
In
1893
after
eleven
years
of
digging
channel
70
(328
ft)
deep
25
(85
ft)

with

The
Argolid
From
the
15th
to
the
11th
century
b.c.
this
rocky
peninsula
was
one
of
the
most
important
centers
in
the
known
world
It
was
from
here
that
the
mighty
Mycenaean
empire
grew
to
encompass
mainland
Greece
and
the
northern
Aegean
islands
The
exploits
of
the
Mycenaeans
and
their
greatest
leader
Agamemnon
were
thought
to
be
myth
until
the
archaeologist
Heinrich
Schliemann
set
out
to
find
evidence
of
the
sites
of
Homerâs
stories
of
Troy
and
Mycenae
He
was
successful
in
doing
both
and
transformed
the
world
of
archaeologyÂ âÂ and
manâs
view
of
history
Schliemann
found
the
remains
of
the
city
of
Mycenae
buried
under
thousands
of
years
worth
of
debris
in
sheltered
valley
some
60
km
(40
miles)
south
of
Corinth
It
was
so
well
hidden
that
the
site
had
been
completely
forgotten
and
it
surprisingly
had
not
been
plundered
by
robbers
The
military
might
of
the
Mycenaeans
had
been
well
documented
by
Homer
but
nothing
could
prepare
the
archaeologists
for
the
artistic
treasures
found
at
the
site
As
they
dug
through
the
remains
the
tombs
of
several
kings
were
discovered;
each
skeleton
lay
where
it
had
been
carefully
buried
the
faces
covered
in
mask
of
pure
gold
Exquisite
statuary
and
intricate
jewelry
found
in
the
family
tombs
below
show
softer
side
of
these
enigmatic
people
and
brought
the
world
of
Agamemnon
to
life
All
the
artifacts
from
the
site
were
taken
to
Athens
and
many
are
now
on
display
in
the
National
Archaeological
Museum
The
archaeological
site
of
Mycenae
now
stripped
of
its
treasures
still
makes
majestic
scene
though
it
is
rather
smaller
than
one
might
imagine
The
large
Cyclopean
WallsâÂ âÂ huge
rough-hewn
blocks
of
granite
laid
one
atop
another
with
extreme
precisionÂ âÂ are
so
called
because
their
enemies
could
not
believe
that
humans
could
be
responsible
for
the
construction
and
gave
the
credit
to
the
one-eyed
giant
of
myth
These
date
from
around
1250
b.c
and
surround
and
protect
the
inner
sanctum
through
which
the
only
entrance
is
the
world-famous
Lionâs
Gate
decorated
with
the
earliest
known
monumental
sculpture
in
Europe
Immediately
as
you
enter
the
compound
you
can
get
birdâs-eye
view
of
Grave
Circle
A
where
the
Royal
grave
shafts
were
found
and
then
climb
to
the
top
of
the
settlement
to
view
the
remains
of
the
Royal
Palace
From
here
the
views
of
the
surrounding
rolling
countryside
are
magnificent
Half
mile
below
the
city
is
an
immense
Beehive
tomb
cut
into
the
hillside
and
lined
with
stone
blocks
The
acoustics
inside
the
tomb
are
very
precise
exaggerating
the
sound
of
your
approaching
fellow
visitors
If
party
of
schoolchildren
arrive
to
test
out
the
tomb
it
may
be
good
idea
to
beat
hasty
retreat
for
the
sake
of
your
ears!
Further
east
from
Mycenae
is
another
ancient
site
also
renowned
for
its
acoustics
The
Theater
of
Epidauros
(Epidavros)
was
built
in
the
fourth
century
b.c
and
could
hold
an
audience
of
12,000
people
Live
performances
still
take
place
here
every
summer
The
theater
does
not
sit
in
splendid
isolation
but
was
part
of
large
settlement
based
around
the
Sanctuary
of
AsklepiosÂ âÂ one
of
the
most
important
centers
of
healing
in
the
ancient
world
Today
there
is
little
left
of
the
site
and
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
hospitals
spas
and
faith-healing
practices
catering
to
travelers
from
across
the
Greek
world
The
port
town
of
Nafplio
makes
the
perfect
base
for
touring
the
area
or
perhaps
spot
to
have
lunch
while
on
your
tour
Set
on
the
south
coast
of
the
Argolid
it
has
been
strategic
strongpoint
for
centuries
and
boasts
no
less
than
four
castles
dating
from
Byzantine
and
Venetian
timesÂ âÂ on
far
more
ancient
foundationsÂ âÂ called
Akronafplia
Castle
The
modern
settlement
has
an
urbane
gentility
with
an
old-town
of
grand
Italianate
mansions
linked
by
cobbled
walkways
Pretty
tavernas
set
tables
out
in
the
street
and
tempt
you
with
fresh
seafood
caught
by
the
small
fishing
boats

The
seaside
promenade
flanked
by
smart
cafÃ©s
is
where
youâll
find
locals
and
Athenians
alike
strolling
in
the
cooling
evening
air
Look
out
towards
the
tiny
fortified
island
of
Bourzi;
you
can
even
take
boat
trip
to
explore
the
castle
if
time
allows
Sounion
The
windswept
peninsula
of
southern
Attica
reaches
out
towards
the
Aegean
Sea
and
at
its
very
tip
(70
km/43
miles
south
of
Athens)
the
ancients
built
beautiful
Temple
to
Poseidon
the
God
of
that
watery
realm
The
views
from
here
are
beautiful
whatever
the
time
of
dayÂ âÂ but
the
sunsets
are
particularly
spectacular
The
temple
itself
is
one
of
the
finest
in
Greece
Of
the
34
Doric
columns
only
15
are
still
in
situ
and
the
ornate
frieze
on
the
pediment
and
entablature
has
been
ravaged
by
the
salty
air
but
the
whole
effect
of
the
building
combined
with
the
settingÂ âÂ with
beach
on
one
side
and
sheer
drop
on
the
otherÂ âÂ is
magnificent
Sounion
is
reached
by
following
the
coast
road
from
the
capital
down
through
several
lovely
resorts
with
private
beaches
GlyfÃ¡da
is
the
closest
to
Athens
and
VouliagmÃ©ni
is
the
furthest
away
Daphni
and
Eleusis
Athens
has
beautiful
downtown
area
but
it
is
one
of
the
largest
cities
in
Europe
and
it
also
has
an
industrial
element
mostly
based
around
the
southern
and
eastern
suburbs
Incongruous
among
the
landscapes
of
oil
refineries
and
factories
youâll
find
historical
gems
to
explore
Ten
kilometers
(6
miles)
west
of
Athens
is
the
Monastery
of
Daphni
(soon
to
be
linked
with
the
downtown
area
by
Metro
extension)
built
on
the
site
of
an
earlier
Temple
of
Apollo
Founded
in
the
fifth
or
sixth
century
a.d.
the
site
was
refurbished
and
extended
in
the
11th
century
but
sacked
and
abandoned
before
being
occupied
by
Orthodox
monks
in
the
16th
century
Restoration
took
place
after
WWII
and
again
in
the
1960s
The
pretty
Byzantine
church
(c1080)
has
stone-and-tile
dome
exterior
but
is
famed
throughout
Greece
for
the
fantastic
mosaics
that
decorate
the
interior
particularly
that
of
Christ
Pantocrator
in
the
main
dome
Through
this
same
industrial
area
runs
the
Sacred
Way
that
linked
Athens
with
the
city
of
Eleusis
In
ancient
times
the
way
was
lined
with
shrines
and
tombs
which
are
now
and
again
brought
to
light
when
redevelopment
takes
place
Eleusis
was
home
to
the
Sanctuary
of
Demeter
and
the
Eleusian
MysteriesÂ âÂ a
series
of
complex
and
enigmatic
rituals
only
performed
by
initiates
of
the
order
The
order
thrived
from
the
Mycenaean
era
to
the
coming
of
Christianity
Annual
celebrations
to
Demeter
took
place
in
Athens
each
September
with
public
festival
and
secret
religious
rite
that
transformed
chosen
followers
into
initiates
of
the

leave
Eleusis
and
walk
along
the
Sacred
Way
entering
Athens
via
the
Sacred
Gate
at
Kerameikos
(see
page

before
proceeding
to
the
Acropolis
In
Eleusis
the
sacred
way
led
directly
to
the
Sanctuary
of
Demeter
and
large
Temple
of
Artemis
with
forecourt
where
the
initiates
would
gather
in

for
the

Delphi
Where
the
mysteries
of
Eleusis
were
only
open
to
few
initiates
advice
from
the
Oracle
at
Delphi
was
open
to
all
It
was
simply
matter
of
making
your
way
to
the
Sanctuary
of
Apollo
now
three
hours
by
road
from
Athens
to
the
northwest
In
ancient
times
this
was
the
spiritual
center
of
the
Greek
world
and
people
would
travel
by
land
or
sea
to
consult
the
gods
No
important
decisions
of
state
could
be
made
without
consulting
the
Oracle
here
and
when
the
Colossus
of
Rhodes
was
toppled
in
an
earthquake
the
people
of
that
city-state
in
the
Aegean
left
it
where
it
lay
after
advice
from
the
Oracle
not
to
rebuild
it
There
has
been
temple
here
since
pre-historic
times
when
Gaia
the
Earth-Mother
goddess
was
worshipped
Even
in
these
early
times
the
gods
would
be
consulted
with
the
oracle
issuing
their
verdicts
from
the
Rock
of
Sybil
Later
Olympian
gods
usurped
Gaia
but
the
sanctuary
retained
its
role
Legend
says
that
the
God
Apollo
arrived
at
Delphi
by
sea
on
dolphin
and
slayed
the
monstrous
python
that
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
sanctuary
Thus
the
temple
was
named
in
his
honor
modern
road
cuts
through
the
remains
and
the
approach
to
the
site
from
the
parking
lot
leads
first
to
the
Roman
Agora
where
pilgrims
would
stock
up
on
supplies
and
offerings
for
the
temple
only
few
minutes
away
Here
you
can
see
the
remains
of
the
Sanctuary
of
Apollo
the
nearby
waters
of
the
Kastalian
Springs
where
pilgrims
would
purify
themselves
before
their
consultation
and
the
Rock
of
Sybil
where
the
oracle
proclaimed
the
verdict
of
the
gods
The
modern
museum
has
wonderful
collection
of
statuary

and
other
artifacts

Below
the
road
are
the
remains
of

Pronaia
where
pilgrims
would
make
their
first

Thereâs
no
other
city
on

Amsterdam
It
is
city

than
Venice
and
more

It
is
also
one
of
the
prettiest
in
Europe
The

the
reflections
of

happily
ripple
on
into
the
21st

However
the
lure
of
Amsterdamâs
bricks

is
only
part
of
its
excitement
Its
contemporary
culture
is
vibrantÂ âÂ itâs

With
little
dry
land
to
build
on
exactly
why
small
group
of
settlers
chose
this
unpromising
spot
is
difficult
to
understand
Yet
it
proved
to
be
an
excellent
decision
because
Amsterdammers
(as
the
natives
of
Amsterdam
are
called)
soon
came
to
control
the
waters
of
the
river
and
the
trade
which
flowed
along
it
By
the
17th
century
Amsterdam
had
become
arguably
the
richest
city
in
the
world
at
the
center
of
huge
Dutch
colonial
empire
It
traded
in
spices
rum
and
sugar
cane
among
other
commodities
and
its
residents
demanded
only
the
best
The
Amsterdam
of
this
periodÂ âÂ called
the
Golden
AgeÂ âÂ forms
the
heart
of
todayâs
city
Without
doubt
the
initial
lure
of
the
city
is
its
numerous
historic
buildings
The
lines
of
tall
narrow
houses
with
their
pretty
gables
rest
beside
picture-perfect
tree-lined
canals
They
are
connected
by
ornate
iron
bridges
and
cobbled
walkways
which
have
changed
little
for
over
300
years
in
fact
since
they
felt
the
footfall
of
such
inhabitants
as
the
artist
Rembrandt
and
explorer
Abel
Tasman
who
gave
his
name
to
Tasmania
Amsterdam
is
wonderful
city
for
visitors
Small
enough
to
stroll
around
and
with
the
canal
side
streets
too
narrow
for
tour
buses
you
canât
drive
past
all
the
best
attractions
at
high
speed
Here
there
is
no
glass
window
between
you
and
reality
You
have
to
feel
the
summer
sun
or
see
your
breath
on
crisp
winter
morning
as
you
step
out
to
see
what
Amsterdam
is
all
about
If
you
take
canal
tour
the
quiet
boats
allow
you
to
float
slowly
along
away
from
the
noise
of
the
modern
world
The
museums
could
keep
you
busy
for
weeks
Art
collections
historic
houses
and
memorials
to
heroes
and
heroines
can
all
be
found
here
For
entertainment
after
the
sun
sets
there
are
over
40
different
performances
in
the
city
every
evening
The
Netherlands
National
Opera
and
National
Ballet
are
based
here
and
there
are
numerous
orchestral
musical
and
comedy
venues
along
with
revues
and
dance
shows
Amsterdam
also
plays
host
to
one
of
the
most
dynamic
club
scenes
in
Europe
with
several
major
venues
drawing
thousands
of
young
people
to
the
city
Yet
if
the
faÃ§ades
of
the
buildings
hark
back
to
the
past
the
interiors
do
not
Internet
banking
interactive
information
points
and
resource
recycling
advice
centersÂ âÂ the
concepts
of
today
are
alive
and
thriving
all
around
the
city
This
is
no
historic
ghost
town
the
city
brims
with
people
Its
houses
are
still
lived
in
(although
most
are
now
apartments
rather
than
single-family
homes)
and
its
streets
filled
with
bakeries
delicatessens
and
wine
merchants
where
people
drop
in
to
buy
dinner
on
the
way
home
in
the
evenings
Itâs
all
part
of
the
fascinating
dichotomy
you
find
at
every
turn
here
The
city
strides
into
the
future
while
still
holding
hands
with
the
past
The
historic
heart
of
Amsterdam
has
remained
unchanged
mainly
because
of
people
power
As
in
most
cities
in
the
world
during
the
second
part
of
the
20th
century
property
developers
eyed
the
old
canal
houses
with
relish
The
price
of
land
was
soaring
and
developers
could
make
tidy
profit
by
demolishing
them
and
replacing
them
with
something
modern
Unfashionable
buildings
such
as
the
warehouses
of
the
old
docks
were
simply
left
to
the
elements
deemed
to
be
worthless
Amsterdammers
though
had
other
ideas
They
went
out
onto
the
streets
to
fight
for
their
city
barricading
historic
houses
and
occupying
empty
buildings
in
the
warehouse
district
This
was
typical
of
the
populace
and
it
wasnât
the
first
time;
in
fact
Amsterdammers
have
been
standing
up
for
what
they
believe
in
for
centuries
When
Protestants
were
persecuted
in
the
16th
century
they
flocked
here
from
all
around
Europe
to
take
refuge
During
WWII
the
dock
workers
of
Amsterdam
went
on
strike
as
an
act
of
protest
against
the
treatment
of
the
Jews
in
the
city
Although
in
the
end
the
protest
was
futile
it
shows
the
strength
of
feeling
and
social
awareness
that
pervades
every
part
of
society
here
As
the
21st
century
begins
Amsterdam
has
over
100
different
nationalities
living
within
the
city
boundaries
situation
which
could
be
fraught
with
difficulty
and
strain
Yet
here
it
only
adds
to
the
cultural
richness
built
up
over
centuries
of
exploration
and
trade
Amsterdammers
seem
to
have
the
ability
to
find
creative
solutions
to
the
problems
of
their
world
When
there
wasnât
enough
housing
on
the
land
they
looked
at
the
empty
canals
and
decided
that
houseboats
would
help
There
are
now
over
2,500
on
the
waterways
of
the
city
When
cars
became
problem
in
the
old
town
they
gave
the
bicycle
priority
and
now
there
are
over
1,000,000
on
the
streetsÂ âÂ and
an
estimated
30,000
at
the
bottom
of
the
canal
system
at
any
one
time!
Youâll
quickly
learn
to
listen
for
the
warning
bells
and
stand
clear
as
their
riders
pedal
by
Perhaps
the
most
widely
publicized
acts
of
tolerance
in
recent
history
have
been
in
the
areas
of
sex
and
drugs
Amsterdammers
looked
at
feasible
and
practical
responses
to
the
issues
and
decriminalized
some
aspects
of
both
This
does
not
make
the
city
one
huge
den
of
iniquity
and
these
areas
are
still
controlled
and
regulated;
in
fact
you
could
visit
Amsterdam
and
be
quite
unaware
of
these
activities
Thereâs
just
recognition
here
that
provided
no
harm
comes
to
you
or
others
around
you
then
you
should
be
free
as
an
adult
to
make
your
own
choices
Amsterdammers
fight
for
everyoneâs
rights
against
oppression
or
the
right
of
David
to
stand
against
the
faceless
Goliath
of
bureaucracy
In
fact
in
Amsterdam
several
thousand
Davids
get
together
to
form
pressure
group
and
Goliath
has
to
sit
up
and
take
notice
This
doesnât
mean
that
Amsterdam
is
utopiaÂ âÂ it
is
city
of
21st-century
pressures
particularly
with
continuing
problems
of
traffic
and
litterÂ âÂ but
it
does
mean
that
the
problems
are
faced
realistically
debated
passionately
by
the
whole
community
and
agreed
solutions
are
put
into
action
When
the
solutions
donât
work
(as
they
often
donât)
the
whole
process
starts
over
again
It
is
all
seen
as
part
of
huge
learning
curve
Of
course
Amsterdammers
donât
spend
all
their
time
waving
protest
banners
They
are
as
industrious
and
hardworking
as
their
forefathers
They
enjoy
galleries
and
exhibitions
as
much
as
the
visitors
doÂ âÂ in
fact
it
can
be
very
hard
to
get
tickets
for
performances
because
of
local
demand
On
weekends
they
head
to
the
parks
to
picnic
or
out
of
the
city
in
large
groups
to
do
more
cycling
They
eat
out
in
restaurants
and
cafÃ©sÂ âÂ where
they
have
over
50
different
types
of
cuisine
to
choose
from
They
love
to
socialize
and
barsÂ âÂ particularly
the
famous
âbrown
barsâÂ âÂ are
the
place
where
they
meet
usually
to
put
the
world
to
rights
In
summer
they
sit
out
with
drink
as
bar
owners
put
out
tables
in
the
squares
and
on
street
corners
Sit
at
table
and
youâll
soon
find
yourself
engaged
in
conversation
(most
Amsterdammers
speak
good
English)
Within
an
hour
youâll
feel
like
local
Amsterdam
has
many
facets
almost
as
many
as
the
diamonds
for
which
the
city
is
famous
Yet
these
seem
to
amalgamate
into
coherent
whole
It
is
city
of
history
which
shouts
from
every
gable
and
street
corner;
city
of
cultureÂ âÂ of
museums
and
musicians
and
artists;
city
of
learning
with
large
university;
city
of
trade
with
banking
at
its
core;
multi-ethnic
city
of
over
100
different
nationalities;
city
of
âlive
and
let
liveâ
as
minority
groups
are
able
to
flourish
and
innovative
ideas
to
develop;
and
of
course
city
of
tourism
with
over
32
million
visitors
per
year
The
beauty
of
its
buildings
is
undisputed
but
it
is
the
sum
of
all
these
parts
that
makes
Amsterdam
an
unforgettable
city
to
visit
brief
History
The
Birth
of
the
Settlement
It
is
difficult
to
think
of
less
promising
spot
for
what
has
become
one
of
the
worldâs
major
cities
Something
must
have
been
appealing
about
the
marshy
outlet
of
the
River
Amstel
where
it
meets
the
River
IJ
(pronounced
âAyâ)Â âÂ a
tidal
inlet
of
the
Zuider
ZeeÂ âÂ even
although
the
area
flooded
on
regular
basis
with
water
forced
in
by
the
prevailing
winter
winds
The
Batavians
travelled
down
the
Rhine
to
found
the
first
permanent
settlement
here
Almost
from
the
start
the
water
had
to
be
controlled
and
the
tradition
of
damming
and
organized
diversion
of
the
river
and
the
tides
began
It
has
been
constant
source
of
concern
ever
since
The
settlement
was
entered
on
maps
of
the
Roman
Empire
but
following
Romeâs
decline
the
land
became
the
domain
of
various
Germanic
tribes
in
what
is
known
throughout
Europe
as
the
âDark
Ages.â
This
probably
had
little
effect
on
the
fledgling
city
whose
main
trade
was
fishing
Towards
the
end
of
the
first
millennium
the
land
we
now
call
the
Netherlands
was
ruled
by
number
of
feudal
lordsÂ âÂ assorted
counts
dukes
and
bishops
who
had
total
power
over
the
land
and
the
people
who
lived
on
it
From
Fishing
to
Trading
The
first
wooden
houses
were
built
in
around
1200
on
artificial
mounds
called
terps
The
town
was
fortified
against
rival
lords
and
against
the
seawaterÂ âÂ the
River
Amstel
being
dammed
at
what
is
now
Dam
Square
This
was
not
just
to
control
the
tides
but
also
to
manipulate
trade
as
it
prevented
seagoing
ships
from
taking
their
goods
down
the
riverÂ âÂ they
had
to
transfer
the
goods
to
locally
owned
boats
for
their
journey
It
gave
the
local
populace
healthy
income
and
began
two
important
elements
in
the
cityâs
history
the
predominance
of
the
merchant
classes
and
the
use
of
barges
for
inland
trade
In
1275
the
settlement
of
Amstelredamme
as
it
was
known
received
permission
from
Count
Floris
of
Holland
to
transport
goods
along
the
river
Amstel
without
incurring
tolls
giving
the
city
monopoly
on
trade
along
the
river
In
1323
Amstelredamme
became
toll-free
port
for
beer
and
once
method
of
preserving
herring
had
been
perfected
in
the
late
14th
century
the
town
also
had
product
with
high
profit
margin
and
began
exporting
fish
around
Europe
However
something
happened
in
1345
which
caused
Amstelredamme
to
change
from
being
mere
trading
port
to
settlement
of
spiritual
importance
dying
man
was
given
piece
of
communion
bread
which
he
could
not
swallow
When
attendants
threw
the
piece
in
the
fire
it
would
not
burn
The
event
was
declared
miracle
and
within
few
years
Amstelredamme
became
place
of
pilgrimage
further
increasing
the
wealth
flowing
into
the
city
The
early
15th
century
saw
healthy
expansion
of
trade
and
the
population
rose
dramatically
Catastrophic
fires
destroyed
large
part
of
the
city
in
1421
and
again
in
1452
Following
the
second
fire
legislation
made
it
illegal
to
build
with
wood
and
brick
became
the
material
of
choice
Today
only
few
buildings
remain
from
before
the
fires;
the
wooden
Het
Houten
Huis
in
the
Begijnhof
is
considered
the
oldest
The
legislation
brought
about
veritable
feast
of
civil
engineering
projects
including
the
building
of
the
city
wall
incorporating
the
Waag
and
Shreierstoren
in
around
1480
The
Arrival
of
the
Spanish
Meanwhile
politically
the
climate
was
changing
with
series
of
dynastic
inter-marriages
Philip
of
Burgundy
began
to
bring
some
semblance
of
unification
to
the
Low
Countries
(the
region
which
roughly
translates
to
the
Netherlands
and
Belgium)
in
the
1420s
He
was
succeeded
by
Charles
the
Bold
whose
daughter
Maria
married
into
the
House
of
Hapsburg
Her
son
Philip
married
Isabella
of
Spain
and
in
1500
she
gave
birth
to
Charles
future
Charles
V
ruler
of
the
Netherlands
Holy
Roman
Emperor
but
more
importantly
King
of
Spain
and
all
her
dominionsÂ âÂ an
empire
on
which
it
was
said
the
sun
never
set
Spanish
rule
was
ruthless
but
for
while
Amsterdam
was
left
alone
Its
position
as
an
important
trading
post
kept
it
apart
from
the
more
barbarous
behavior
in
other
areas
It
saw
threefold
increase
in
its
population
as
refugees
flooded
in
from
other
parts
of
the
empire
Diamond
polishers
from
Antwerp
and
Jews
from
Portugal
brought
their
influences
to
the
city
Religious
Strife
Amsterdam
was
already
developing
reputation
of
tolerance
as
these
new
and
disparate
groups
settled
into
the
city
At
the
same
time
Martin
Lutherâs
new
Christian
doctrine
Protestantism
was
spreading
like
wildfire
across
Europe
It
took
firm
foothold
in
the
northern
provinces
of
the
Low
CountriesÂ âÂ with
Amsterdam
at
its
heart
It
was
at
this
time
that
Huguenots
(French
Protestants)
came
to
Amsterdam
to
flee
persecution
in
their
own
country
To
counter
Protestantism
the
Catholic
Spanish
instigated
the
vicious
and
cruel
force
of
Inquisition
In
1535
there
were
anti-papacy
demonstrations
in
Dam
Square
and
in
1550
an
Edict
of
Blood
was
issued
by
the
Spanish
to
hunt
out
the
heretics
Thus
began
80
years
of
civil
strife
in
Amsterdam
and
the
region
of
Holland
It
is
difficult
to
understand
why
Charles
V
who
was
born
in
and
had
strong
family
ties
to
The
Low
Countries
should
treat
the
region
with
such
harshness
however
the
dynasty
power
base
was
in
Spain
and
emotion
had
no
part
in
Empire-making
In
1567
he
sent
the
Duke
of
Alva
to
enforce
heavy
taxes
and
military
rule
on
Amsterdam
Towards
Independence
This
atmosphere
of
intense
fear
and
violence
sowed
the
seeds
of
revolt
The
House
of
Orange
(with
power
base
around
the
small
town
in
France)
had
claim
to
lands
in
the
Low
Countries
and
one
member
William
the
Silent
began
to
organize
opposition
to
Spanish
rule
In
1578
the
people
of
Amsterdam
rose
up
against
the
papal
forces
and
threw
them
from
the
cityÂ âÂ a
time
known
as
the
Alteration
Unfortunately
though
all
thoughts
of
tolerance
were
forgotten
and
the
zeal
with
which
the
Inquisition
sought
out
Protestants
was
turned
on
Catholic
worshippers
Their
churches
were
violated
and
they
were
forced
to
convert
or
to
worship
in
fearful
secrecy
In
1579
seven
provinces
north
of
the
Rhine
conclude
the
Treaty
of
Utrecht
releasing
the
suffocating
grip
of
Spanish
rule
Although
William
was
murdered
in
1584
his
sons
continued
his
work
and
in
1648
the
Treaties
of
The
Hague
and
Westphalia
saw
the
creation
of
the
independent
State
of
the
Netherlands
whose
boundaries
were
very
much
as
they
are
today
The
Coming
of
the
Golden
Age
As
Spanish
influence
faded
the
Dutch
star
began
to
rise
First
they
drew
up
agreements
with
the
Portuguese
who
had
themselves
concluded
trade
treaties
in
the
East
making
them
the
sole
source
of
new
goods
such
as
spices
and
silks
Merchants
from
Amsterdam
bought
these
goods
and
sold
them
in
the
north
making
vast
profits
in
the
process
When
the
Spanish
took
Portugal
in
1580
the
Amsterdam
merchants
decided
to
go
into
the
import
business
themselves
and
in
1595
sent
their
first
fleet
to
Asia
In
1602
the
Dutch
East
India
Company
(VOC)
was
founded
and
it
obtained
monopoly
on
all
trade
routes
east
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
It
founded
headquarters
in
Batavia
(now
Jakarta)
in
Java
and
obtained
monopoly
trade
agreement
with
Japan
in
1641
VOC
ships
under
the
command
of
Abel
Tasman
landed
in
Australia
some
150
years
before
Captain
Cook
The
Dutch
also
looked
to
the
west
and
in
1609
sent
Englishman
Henry
Hudson
to
search
for
route
to
China
In
fact
he
landed
far
from
China
and
discovered
the
river
which
still
bears
his
nameÂ âÂ the
Hudson;
he
also
traded
with
the
native
peoples
for
the
purchase
of
Manhattan
Island
and
travelled
to
the
Caribbean
taking
several
islands
as
Dutch
colonies
Dutch
ships
brought
back
goods
not
seen
before
in
the
western
world
Strange
and
wonderful
creatures
new
fruits
and
vegetables
and
crafts
of
immense
beauty
and
they
were
all
traded
at
immense
profit
with
the
nations
of
Europe
The
Netherlands
entered
the
period
called
the
âGolden
Age,â
when
the
VOC
was
more
powerful
than
many
countries
and
Amsterdam
was
at
the
heart
of
this
vast
trading
Empire
Rich
merchants
needed
banks
and
support
infrastructure
which
developed
quickly
in
the
city
People
flooded
in
to
take
advantage
of
the
new
commercial
opportunities
the
population
rose
rapidly
and
the
old
medieval
city
simply
could
not
cope
It
was
still
very
much
within
the
boundaries
set
almost
150
years
before
Plans
were
made
for
series
of
new
canals
forming
in
ring
or
girdle
around
the
old
medieval
horseshoeÂ âÂ three
in
all
Herengracht
Keizersgracht
and
Prinsengracht
The
canal
side
lots
were
sold
to
the
wealthy
of
the
city
who
built
the
finest
houses
they
could
afford
The
confidence
of
the
city
brought
opportunities
for
the
arts
and
the
burgeoning
sciences
The
artists
Rembrandt
Frans
Hals
Vermeer
and
Paulus
Potter
were
all
working
in
this
era
their
work
much
in
demand
by
the
merchant
classes
At
the
same
time
the
Guild
of
Surgeons
was
learning
about
the
physiology
of
the
body
at
their
meeting
place
in
the
Waag
helped
by
Antonie
van
Leeuwenhoek
who
had
invented
the
microscope
Decline
and
Fall
Expansion
quickly
peaked
however
and
the
European
powers
who
had
carved
up
the
New
World
set
about
testing
each
other
in
dynastic
conflicts
and
colonial
rivalry
The
English
were
the
main
rivals
of
the
Dutch
on
the
high
seas
and
there
were
several
wars
between
the
two
in
the
17th
and
18th
centuries
In
1665â1667
the
Dutch
sailed
up
the
River
Medway
and
sank
the
British
fleet
moored
there
The
18th
century
saw
Amsterdam
grow
into
the
foremost
financial
center
in
the
world
but
the
seeds
of
decline
had
already
been
planted
When
the
English
colonies
in
New
England
rose
up
in
revolt
against
the
British
they
found
ready
allies
in
the
Dutch
From
their
colonies
in
the
Caribbean
they
sent
caches
of
arms
and
ammunition
The
British
were
furious
and
went
to
war
in
1780
destroying
the
Dutch
navy
and
signaling
sudden
decline
in
power
and
influence
from
which
the
Netherlands
never
recovered
Trade
suffered
to
such
an
extent
that
in
1791
the
VOC
went
into
liquidation
In
the
latter
part
of
the
century
there
were
anti-Orange
demonstrations
by
pro-French
factions
in
the
country
and
in
1795
Napoleon
Bonaparte
took
the
Netherlands
in
his
epic
march
across
Europe
Under
the
yoke
of
another
foreign
power
and
with
trade
at
an
all
time
low
the
Golden
Age
was
truly
dead
The
Return
of
the
House
of
Orange
Napoleon
installed
his
brother
Louis
as
King
of
Holland
and
he
chose
to
take
the
fine
Town
Hall
on
Dam
Square
as
his
palaceÂ âÂ now
the
Koninklijk
Palace
But
only
four
years
later
he
fled
the
city
after
civil
disturbances
broke
out
when
he
raised
taxes
When
Napoleonâs
bubble
burst
and
French
power
began
to
wane
William
of
Orange
emerged
from
exile
and
was
proclaimed
king
in
1813
Amsterdam
had
to
work
its
way
out
of
economic
decline
but
throughout
the
19th
century
the
city
grew
steadily
Industrialization
changed
the
city
With
the
building
of
the
Central
Station
at
the
end
of
the
century
Amsterdam
turned
its
back
on
its
seafaring
past
and
looked
towards
the
mechanical
age
for
its
future
The
station
was
built
over
the
old
harbor
wall
and
some
of
the
oldest
canals
in
the
city
center
were
filled
in
to
allow
better
access
to
motorized
vehicles
Dam
Square
was
landlocked
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
However
in
the
spirit
of
the
Victorian
Age
the
philanthropic
city
fathers
funded
the
building
of
several
major
museums
and
parks
along
with
instigating
social
reforms
which
created
one
of
the
first
welfare
states
The
20th
Century
The
Netherlands
stayed
neutral
in
WWI
and
efforts
in
the
first
half
of
the
century
were
concentrated
on
land
reclamation
which
increased
agricultural
production
and
living
space
The
Zuider
Zee
was
finally
tamed
with
the
building
of
19-mile
dike
the
Afsluitdijk
in
the
north
In
the
depression
of
the
early
1930s
there
were
several
schemes
to
cut
unemployment
including
the
creation
of
Amsterdam
BosÂ âÂ a
park
and
woodland
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
The
Dutch
hoped
to
remain
neutral
at
the
outbreak
of
WWII
but
the
Germans
had
other
ideas
and
occupied
the
Low
Countries
in
1940
The
Dutch
Royal
family
and
Parliament
escaped
the
enemy
to
set
up
court
in
London
Amsterdammers
were
horrified
at
the
treatment
of
their
Jewish
neighbors
and
the
dock
workers
staged
brave
one-day
strike
to
protest
but
almost
all
the
Jews
were
transported
to
concentration
camps
never
to
return
In
Prinsengracht
Otto
Frank
and
his
family
hid
in
the
attic
of
their
business
premises
for
over
two
years
before
being
discovered
His
daughter
Anne
wrote
diary
during
their
time
in
the
attic
which
became
an
international
bestseller
after
the
war
Anne
herself
died
at
concentration
camp
only
weeks
before
the
war
ended
In
September
1944
Operation
Market
Garden
made
famous
in
the
film
Bridge
Too
Far
saw
thousands
of
allied
paratroops
dropping
into
the
Netherlands
to
try
and
take
key
bridges
on
rivers
leading
to
Germany
The
people
welcomed
them
and
rose
up
to
help
them
but
the
operation
failed
and
the
Germans
punished
the
Dutch
people
during
the
winter
of
1944â1945
Food
and
fuel
were
withdrawn
leaving
the
population
to
starve
The
Modern
State
Soon
after
the
end
of
the
war
Dutch
colonies
in
the
Far
East
gained
their
independenceÂ âÂ principally
as
the
new
country
IndonesiaÂ âÂ as
Holland
sought
to
rebuild
its
shattered
infrastructure
The
Dutch
used
this
period
to
consolidate
their
social
systems
to
the
benefit
of
the
whole
community
Amsterdam
became
mecca
for
counter-culture
groups
such
as
hippies
who
were
drawn
by
the
well-known
open-mindedness
of
the
people
âPeople
powerâ
began
to
exert
its
influence
which
ensured
that
in
Amsterdam
at
least
progress
did
not
mean
sweeping
away
the
past
Where
developers
saw
the
opportunity
to
demolish
derelict
canal
houses
and
warehouses
the
people
fought
(sometimes
literally)
to
save
what
they
considered
their
heritage
Today
much
of
the
historic
city
is
protected
by
statute
although
any
redevelopment
provokes
much
debate
The
building
of
the
Muziek
Theater
in
the
1980s
which
resulted
in
the
demolition
of
several
old
houses
was
case
in
pointÂ âÂ with
vitriolic
demonstrations
by
local
pressure
groups
The
Dutch
embraced
the
European
Union
(EU)Â âÂ they
joined
in
1957
when
it
was
still
called
the
European
CommunityÂ âÂ seeing
it
as
way
of
increasing
their
security
and
their
economic
stability
Their
natural
strengths
in
agricultural
production
and
trade
have
ensured
their
success
in
the
new
alliance
and
the
Netherlands
has
become
an
important
base
for
foreign
companies
who
have
trade
ties
in
Europe
Throughout
the
1990s
the
Dutch
have
been
at
the
forefront
of
movement
to
open
national
borders
increase
peopleâs
freedom
of
movement
and
expand
trade
within
the
EU
taking
full
part
in
the
delicate
negotiations
which
surrounded
the
launch
of
the
Euro
currency
in
1999
Amsterdam
has
become
one
of
the
premier
tourist
cities
in
the
world
trading
on
its
historic
center
and
its
wealth
of
artistic
collections
Today
it
operates
very
much
as
it
did
during
the
Golden
Age
with
banking
trade
and
modern
âpilgrimsâ
(in
the
form
of
tourists)
to
ensure
that
it
remains
wealthy
city
Perhaps
the
only
specter
in
the
air
is
the
one
which
worried
the
inhabitants
of
old
Amstelredamme
centuries
before;
water
levels
Global
warming
over
the
next
few
decades
threatens
to
raise
water
levels
around
the
world
and
the
NetherlandsÂ âÂ ânetherâ
means
âlow-lyingâ
or
âbelowâÂ âÂ will
have
to
work
hard
at
solving
the
problem
for
its
future
inhabitants
Where
to
Go
New
Providence
Itâs
not
the
largest
of
the
Bahamas
islands
and
not
the
most
stunningly
beautiful
yet
when
most
people
think
of
the
Bahamas
they
first
think
of
New
Providence
or
its
major
town
Nassau
The
island
is
only
80
square
miles
in
size
yet
180,000
of
the
280,000
Bahamians
lives
here
The
town
and
its
port
and
international
airport
are
the
hub
for
every
activity
in
the
Bahamas
Government
administration
taxes
and
furniture
shipments
for
new
homes
all
start
from
here
and
radiate
out
to
the
other
islands
New
Providence
also
attracts
over
million
visitors
every
year
and
Nassau
is
one
of
the
main
cruise
ports
of
the
Caribbean
The
island
is
magnet
for
fun
seekers
and
serious
shoppers
and
it
serves
both
very
well
Nassau
Nassau
town
has
fine
pedigree
dating
back
through
colonial
times
and
the
compact
town
center
still
has
the
feel
of
life
under
the
English
Out
in
the
natural
harbor
which
offered
shelter
to
many
pirate
ship
is
major
port
that
can
accommodate
15
large
cruise
ships
at
one
time
This
capacity
was
created
in
1965
when
public
money
was
invested
to
dredge
the
port
specifically
to
allow
bigger
ships
to
enter
The
huge
vessels
hundreds
of
feet
high
dwarf
the
towns
buildings
which
regulations
set
at
maximum
of
three
stories
and
create
one
of
the
most
effective
juxtapositions
of
modernity
and
history
found
anywhere
in
the
world
The
cruise
port
at
Prince
George
Wharf
brings
in
by
far
the
majority
of
visitors
to
the
Bahamas
Immediately
in
front
of
the
cruise
port
youâll
find
line
of
horse-drawn
surreys
waiting
to
offer
you
genteel
tour
along
the
historic
streets
The
horses
wait
under
the
cooling
shade
for
their
next
customers
(In
the
hot
summer
months
the
horses
are
not
allowed
to
work
from
2â4pm.)
The
horses
trot
slowly
past
all
the
sights
in
town
but
you
can
also
easily
stroll
around
yourself
and
see
everything
in
couple
of
hoursÂ âÂ if
youâre
not
seduced
by
the
many
shopping
opportunities
between
the
docks
and
the
historic
old
town
The
first
sight
that
will
attract
your
attention
is
the
Straw
Market
on
Market
Plaza
which
backs
onto
Woodes
Rodgers
Walk
For
many
years
this
has
been
the
showcase
for
Bahamian
handicrafts
Straw
goods
including
baskets
and
mats
are
favorite
souvenirs;
each
island
produces
straw
goods
in
its
own
style
and
patterns
Bestsellers
are
hats
dolls
bags
and
baskets
There
is
some
exquisite
work
to
be
found
but
be
aware
that
with
decline
in
basket-making
throughout
the
Bahamas
an
increasing
number
of
articles
are
imported
from
the
Far
East;
most
of
these
are
at
the
cheaper
end
of
the
scale
The
ubiquitous
modern
souvenir
the
T-shirt
is
also
available
with
an
almost
limitless
number
of
pictures
patterns
and
slogans
The
ladies
who
run
the
stalls
are
easy-going
and
seem
to
have
limitless
enthusiasm
for
the
next
sale
Youâll
hear
numerous
calls
of
âHey
honey
come
look
for
something
nice
here.â
The
straw
market
fronts
onto
Bay
Street
one
of
the
leading
duty-free
shopping
capitals
of
the
world
Only
few
years
ago
this
street
was
the
domain
of
the
Bay
Street
Boys
small
group
of
men
who
controlled
all
economic
activity
in
the
Bahamas;
now
Bay
Street
seduces
visitors
with
huge
sparkling
gems
hundreds
of
ounces
of
gold
and
the
smell
of
thousand
designer
fragrances
The
faÃ§ades
of
the
pretty
18th-century
shops
hide
modern
air-conditioned
shopping
palaces
piled
high
with
luxury
goods
Many
visitors
especially
those
with
only
few
hours
to
spare
go
no
farther
than
the
shops
of
NassauÂ âÂ shopping
for
bargain
can
be
exhausting
It
would
be
shame
however
not
to
explore
what
the
rest
of
Nassau
has
to
offer
as
there
are
number
of
historic
gems
to
be
discovered
in
and
around
the
town
The
Bahamian
people
appreciate
and
enjoy
the
many
touches
of
colonial
history
retained
from
its
days
as
part
of
the
British
Empire
Rawson
Square
just
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
Prince
George
Wharf
is
good
place
to
start
your
tour
The
tourist
information
office
here
can
arm
you
with
leaflets
and
maps
that
will
help
you
make
the
most
of
your
day
Directly
opposite
Rawson
Square
across
Bay
Street
are
the
Public
Buildings
of
Parliament
Square
which
have
been
in
continuous
use
since
1812
They
were
modeled
on
the
governmental
complex
in
New
Bern
capital
of
the
North
Carolina
colony
two
centuries
ago
marble
statue
of
young
seated
Queen
Victoria
in
front
recalls
the
era
of
British
rule
The
two
chambers
of
the
modern
House
of
Assembly
meet
in
the
so-called
western
building
(on
the
right
side
if
youâre
facing
from
the
square);
the
public-records
office
and
government
publications
department
are
housed
in
the
other
historic
buildings
Behind
them
in
modern
edifices
are
the
Law
Courts
Here
you
may
find
yourself
in
the
middle
of
parade
to
open
parliament
or
convene
the
courts
The
smart
uniforms
and
pomp
are
taken
directly
from
British
ceremonial
activities
but
the
ambiance
is
truly
Bahamian
Check
with
the
Tourist
Board
for
dates
of
ceremonial
occasions
all
of
which
happen
frequently
Behind
the
modern
law
court
complex
is
the
Nassau
Public
Library
interesting
because
it
used
to
be
the
islandâs
jail
The
octagonal
structure
on
Shirley
Street
dates
from
1797
and
has
pretty
exterior
but
the
interior
is
more
fascinating
The
old
cells
were
retained
when
the
structure
became
the
library
in
1873
and
books
line
every
wall
replacing
prisoners
and
creating
private
reading
areas
The
library
museum
also
has
collection
of
old
maps
and
charts
used
to
navigate
the
waters
around
the
Bahamas
If
youâre
walking
continue
east
along
Shirley
Street
until
you
reach
Elizabeth
Avenue
and
turn
right
The
land
rises
suddenly
here
This
area
behind
the
downtown
area
had
been
used
to
great
strategic
effect
by
the
British
Fort
Fincastle
was
built
atop
the
rise
in
1793
to
watch
the
shipping
lanes
and
protect
Nassau
harbor
The
tiny
fort
is
shaped
like
the
prow
of
ship
though
there
is
hardly
enough
room
to
fit
football
team
never
mind
unit
of
the
queenâs
soldiery
To
reach
the
fort
you
must
climb
the
Queenâs
Staircase
an
artificial
narrow
gorge
leading
to
65
steps
that
climb
hillside
Both
the
gorge
and
the
staircase
created
to
allow
soldiers
to
reach
or
leave
the
fort
quickly
were
hewn
from
the
solid
limestone
by
contingent
of
slave
workers
At
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
next
to
the
fort
the
Water
Tower
offers
birdâs-eye
view
over
Nassau
Paradise
Island
and

of
the

of
New
Providence
small

in
the
concrete

Donât
forget
your
camera
After
visit
to
the
tower
return
to
the
compact
town
center
Stroll
along
any
street
and
youâll
bump
into
fine
historic
buildings;
several
date
from
the
late
1700s
and
most
are
painted
in
pretty
pastels
that
cheerfully
reflect
the
bright
Bahamian
sunlight
Pink-and-white
Balcony
House
on
Market
Street
is
particularly
fine
example
The
oldest
wooden
house
on
the
islandÂ âÂ it
was
built
by
shipwrights
around
1790
of
American
soft
cedarÂ âÂ it
has
been
restored
and
is
now
museum
that
offers
delightful
view
of

was
once
the

of
the
Nassau
slave
auction
It
now
houses
the
Pompey
Museum
of
Slavery
and
Emancipation
The
pale
pink
stone
house
is
unassuming
but
the
interior
tells
of
the
plight
of
slaves
on
the

and
of

work
that
was
undertaken
in

Nassau
attraction
at
the
corner
of
George
and
Marlborough
Streets
brings
to
life
the
dramatic
and
exciting
world
of
the
pirates
The
building
itself
dates
from
the
18th
century;
the

inside
recreates
the
Nassau
quayside
of
the
17th
century
three-quarter-size

have
been
stunningly
brought
to

act
out
the
roles
of
shipmate
and

and
regale
you
with
tales
of
their

Visitors
then
step
inside
the
75-ft-

long
vessel
to
examine
the
paraphernalia
of
the
pirateâs
trade
that
line
the
corridors
and
decks
Treasure
chests
mix
with

tell
of
their

in
the
lonely
and
dangerous
times
Listen
to
the
groaning
of
injured
pirates
and
witness
the
rudimentary

unsanitary
surgical
techniques
that
led
to
so
many
deathsÂ âÂ the

diet
of
âsalmagundi,â
stew

Paradise
Island
Across
Nassau
Harbour
north
of
the
town
is
Paradise
Island
known
until
the
1940s
as
Hog
Island
For
many
centuries
the
island
simply
acted
as
protective
barrier
against
bad
weather
and
attack
from
invaders
Its
recent
history
is
fascinating:
In
the
1930s
it
was
owned
by
Swedish
millionaire
Axel
Wenner-Gren
an
arms
manufacturer
who
was
found
to
be
Nazi
sympathizer
He
sold
the
island
to
Huntingdon
Hartford
who
changed
the
name
from
Hog
to
Paradise
and
created
beautiful
private
retreat
now
the
Ocean
Club
Hotel
Later
gangster
Per
Lansky
began
the
process
that
transformed
the
island
from
private
sanctuary
with
magnificent
homes
into
playground
for
tourists
The
wonderful
beaches
such
as
Cabbage
Beach
on
the
northern
coast
were
the
focus
of
the
development
The
first
hotels
began
to
appear
in
the
1960s
when
gambling
was
lure
to
the
rich
and
famous
As
Paradise
Island
saw
owners
Donald
Trump
and
Merv
Griffin
come
and
go
it
went
through
continuing
series
of
developments
and
re-developments
Today
Paradise
Island
may
be
close
to
fulfilling
the
dream
of
the
perfect
vacation
playground
It
has
many
of
the
essential
ingredients
needed:
fine
white-sand
beaches
protected
marina
golf
course
group
of
fine
hotels
and
perhaps
the
biggest
adult
playground
this
side
of
Las
Vegas
The
brainchild
of
the
Sol
Group
Atlantis
Paradise
Island
is
new
concept
in
resortsÂ âÂ itâs
huge
hotel
with
an
amazing
theme
park
and
entertainment
village
all
on
one
site
The
resort
takes
its
name
and
inspiration
from
the
lost
city
of
Atlantis
said
by
some
to
lie
off
the
coast
of
Bimini
This
theme
runs
throughout
the
whole
resort
The
vast
open
foyers
and
public
areas
of
the
hotel
have
high
columns
of
cathedral-like
dimensions;
the
walkways
and
outside
terraces
recall
Mayan
temples
with
large
stones
covering
the
faÃ§ade
Waterfalls
literally
or
figuratively
cascade
to
give
feeling
of
city
just
having
risen
from
the
ocean
Man-made
sheltered
lagoons
provide
for
safe
swimming
snorkeling
and
sunbathing
The
masterpiece
of
the
whole
Atlantis
complex
is
the
enormous
Aquarium,Â which
can
be
viewed
from
almost
any
point
in
the
resortÂ âÂ from
the
rooms
above
in
the
towers
from
ground
level
and
from
below
ground
Within
the
Aquarium
is
an
area
called
the
Dig
spectacular
underwater
environment
complete
with
sunken
âtreasures,â
vast
stone
columns
fallen
temples
and
godlike
figures
all
intended
to
show
what
Atlantis
might
look
like
while
being
excavated
The
entire
attraction
has
then
been
filled
with
sea
water
and
complete
ecosystem
of
fish
and
crustaceans
100,000
in
all
Sharks
and
rays
patrol
the
waterways
eels
and
lobsters
lurk
in
the
crevices
and
fissures
truly
awe-inspiring
sight
The
resort
boasts
20
restaurants
three
shopping
malls
and
vast
casino
area
Outside
water
slides
nature
trails
and
swimming
pools
indicate
that
no
expense
has
been
spared
to
create
the
ultimate
playground
for
all
age
groups
Many
visitors
to
the
Bahamas
drop
in
just
to
marvel
at
the
artistry
and
technical
skill
that
was
employed
to
create
this
complex
Non-guests
must
pay
fee
to
enjoy
the
resort
facilities
and
an
extra
fee
for
visit
to
the
Dig
At
the
eastern
end
of
Paradise
Island
stands
much
older
structure
that
offers
the
opportunity
for
restful
contemplation
The
Cloisters
are
the
remains
of
14th-century
monastery
that
was
bought
in
France
by
Huntingdon
Hartford
taken
apart
and
rebuilt
in
the
grounds
of
his
home
now
the
Ocean
Club
hotel
Hartford
set
the
small
courtyard
on
rise
several
hundred
yards
away
from
the
house
and
created
an
elaborate
garden
to
lead
to
the
edifice
The
Versailles
Gardens
based
on
Louis
XIVâs
formal
palace
gardens
outside
Paris
have
terraces
fountains
and
statues
that
provide
soothing
vista
leading
the
eye
from
the
house
to
the
cloisters
It
is
possible
to
visit
the
Cloisters
during
daylight
hoursÂ âÂ they
stand
next
to
the
only
road
that
traverses
the
islandÂ âÂ but
they
are
used
regularly
for
wedding
ceremonies
so
you
might
find
them
closed
Paradise
Island
is
connected
to
New
Providence
by
two
bridges
that
rise
high
into
the
air
to
allow
boat
traffic
to
pass
beneath
One
bridge
carries
traffic
on
to
the
island
the
other
takes
traffic
back
to
Nassau
(there
is
small
toll
for
vehicles)
At
the
foot
of
the
bridges
is
small
quay
where
you
can
catch
ferry
to
Woodes
Rogers
Walk
in
Nassau
port
This
is
also
the
docking
point
for
boats
to
Blue
Lagoon
and
the
Dolphin
Experience
small
cay
just
20-minute
boat
ride
from
Paradise
Island
Blue
Lagoon
is
the
site
of
facility
where
you
can
swim
with
the
dolphins
or
help
the
staff
look
after
the
animals
for
day
Boats
leave
several
times
day
No
public
busesÂ âÂ jitneysÂ âÂ are
allowed
over
the
toll
bridge
to
Paradise
Island
Youâll
need
to
take
taxi
to
and
from
Nassau
if
you
donât
use
the
ferry
Once
on
the
island
however
you
can
use
the
public
bus
service
which
runs
the
length
of
the
island
linking
the
hotels
with
the
quayside
and
the
small
shopping
center
Underneath
the
bridges
in
the
harbor
is
small
island
called
Potterâs
Cay
This
is
where
fishing
boats
and
mail
boats
dock
and
where
real
Bahamian
life
happens
Stalls
sell
fresh
conch
salad
and
people
sit
and
wait
for
the
nightâs
sailing
The
harbor
masterâs
office
here
can
help
you
with
mail-boat
schedules
and
prices
Beyond
Nassau
There
are
number
of
interesting
attractions
outside
of
Nassau
that
make
it
worthwhile
to
rent
car
or
hire
taxi
for
the
day
West
of
Nassau
Head
west
out
of
Nassau
and
within
couple
of
minutes
youâll
encounter
three
very
different
attractions
Thereâs
no
missing
the
austere
gray
ramparts
of
Fort
Charlotte
which
guards
the
western
approaches
to
Nassau
Harbour
Built
by
Lord
Dunmore
in
1787â89
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
and
named
after
the
wife
of
George
III
this
is
the
largest
fort
in
the
Bahamas
But
not
one
shot
was
ever
fired
from
here
in
angerÂ âÂ the
only
volleys
ever
launched
were
part
of
ceremonial
salutes
Life
must
have
been
pretty
boring
for
the
soldiers
as
many
had
the
time
to
carve
their
names
in
the
stones
along
the
battlements
Guides
escort
visitors
around
the
interior
of
the
fort
as
well
as
through
the
dungeons
which
thankfully
saw
little
torture
In
fact
Fort
Charlotte
is
well
regarded
by
New
Providence
residents
as
shelter
during
hurricanes
Nearby
is
Ardastra
Gardens
Zoo
and
Conservation
Centre
landscaped
park
famed
for
its
pink
flamingos
which
are
paraded
three
times
day
into
small
enclosure
to
offer
visitors
closer
look
These
birds
once
common
in
certain
Bahamian
islands
are
now
disappearing
though
the
reasons
for
the
decline
are
disputed
Another
endangered
species
the
Bahamian
Parrot
is
under
threat
from
loss
of
habitat
The
Gardens
is
one
of
only
small
number
of
centers
that
has
developed
breeding
program
for
this
vocal
and
gregarious
bird
in
the
hope
of
replenishing
colonies
in
the
wild
There
are
many
more
species
of
Caribbean
mammals
reptiles
birds
and
fish
to
find
as
you
explore
the
51â2
acres
of
tropical
parkland
Head
back
to
the
main
coast
road
and
you
will
find
two
small
cays
lying
immediately
offshore
The
first
is
Arawak
Cay
home
to
the
local
fishing
fleet
number
of
colorful
shacks
line
the
approach
road
where
you
can
buy
conch
and
fried
fish
always
fresh
and
always
delicious
Weekends
can
be
busy
with
local
families
Travel
through
Arawak
Cay
to
reach
Silver
Cay
where
there
is
small
resort
with
pretty
beach
Here
you
will
find
Crystal
Cay
site
of
marine
park
where
you
can
take
close
look
at
the
undersea
world
without
getting
wet
man-made
coral
reef
has
been
created
on
the
sea
bottom
and
you
can
watch
all
the
marine
activity
from
an
underwater
observatory
The
reef
attracts
many
kinds
of
aquatic
creatures
that
are
free
to
come
and
go
as
they
please
The
observatory
looks
decidedly
futuristic
and
can
be
seen
quite
clearly
from
the
road
as
you
travel
along
the
coast
Other
activities
at
Crystal
Cay
include
sea
turtle
environment
touch
pool
where
you
can
stroke
sting
ray
or
pet
conch
and
snorkel
trail
if
you
want
to
get
into
the
water
yourself
little
further
west
along
the
coast
you
will
find
Cable
Beach
the
third
main
center
of
tourism
on
New
Providence
Several
luxury
hotels
line
the
shore
only
minutes
by
car
from
central
Nassau
The
Nassau
Marriott
Resort
Hotel
attracts
many
visitors
with
its
casino
stage
shows
and
restaurants
The
Cable
Beach
âstripâ
is
under
continual
development
and
number
of
private
restaurants
have
opened
recently
to
provide
alternatives
for
guests
staying
at
the
resorts
East
of
Nassau
The
territory
east
and
southeast
of
Nassau
has
seen
great
deal
of
development
in
the
last
twenty
years;
many
of
the
major
residential
areas
that
have
sprung
up
hold
little
interest
for
visitors
One
legacy
of
the
past
is
Blackbeardâs
Tower
said
to
have
been
lookout
post
for
the
famous
pirate
It
is
little
careworn
and
forlorn
today
and
may
be
worth
visiting
only
for
its
view
of
the
harbor
Guarding
the
eastern
entrance
to
Nassau
harbor
is
tiny
Fort
Montague
least
visited
of
the
old
colonial
fortifications
It
now
looks
out
towards
the
pleasure
palaces
of
Paradise
Island
Grand
Bahama
Northwest
of
New
Providence
Grand
Bahama
Island
was
largely
ignored
through
colonial
history
and
was
for
long
time
comparative
backwater
That
it
is
now
the
second
most
popular
tourist
destination
in
the
Bahamas
is
all
due
to
the
forethought
of
one
manÂ âÂ and
great
deal
of
investment
made
since
1955
The
British
had
little
interest
in
developing
Grand
Bahama
but
the
island
lies
only
55
miles
from
the
Florida
coast
and
in
the
postâWorld
War
II
period
it
finally
attracted
the
attention
of
developers
As
the
economy
of
the
US
grew
and
BahamianâUS
trade
increased
group
of
businessmen
led
by
Wallace
Groves
saw
the
potential
in
the
development
of
Grand
Bahama
In
1955
the
British
government
signed
the
Hawksbill
Agreement
which
gave
Groves
50,000
acres
(20,000
hectares)
of
land
and
concession
to
import
duty-free
goods
In
return
Groves
agreed
to
build
deep-water
harbor
and
to
encourage
business
development
First
there
was
boom
then
there
was
bust
but
container
port
opened
in
the
1990s
is
breathing
new
life
into
the
flagging
commercial
sector
The
opening
of
the
first
casino
in
1964
sparked
the
tourist
boom
and
since
then
Grand
Bahama
has
been
busy
developing
as
tourist
âmecca.â
Its
modernity
and
the
close
links
with
the
US
create
totally
different
atmosphere
and
style
compared
to
what
youâll
find
in
New
Providence
and
many
visitors
enjoy
the
more
âAmericanâ
feel
Freeport-Lucaya
The
main
settlement
on
Grand
Bahama
Freeport-Lucaya
is
in
fact
two
separate
towns
that
have
now
grown
together
In
theory
Freeport
was
the
commercial
center
and
Lucaya
the
coastal
resort
In
reality
the
two
towns
now
mix
so
successfully
it
is
difficult
to
tell
where
the
dividing
line
is
Most
of
the
islandâs
40,000
people
live
here
and
the
towns
continue
to
develop
There
are
no
historical
attractions
here
but
Freeport-Lucaya
is
happy
to
offer
the
alternative
of
unashamed
hedonistic
pleasure
and
relaxation
Not
surprisingly
for
duty-free
island
shopping
plays
large
part
in
trip
to
Grand
Bahama
International
Bazaar
in
Freeport
takes
you
on
shopping
trip
around
the
world
Enter
the
bazaar
through
the
red
Japanese
Torii
or
âwelcome
gateâ
and
you
can
visit
France
Africa
and
India
all
within
few
minutes
Unusual
offerings
such
as
rare
stamps
can
be
found
among
the
standard
duty-free
shops
that
carry
the
most
exclusive
names
in
watches
jewelry
and
perfume
Behind
the
South
American
area
youâll
find
the
Perfume
Factory
where
you
can
create
your
own
personal
fragrance
Mix
essential
oils
to
balance
with
your
skin
and
give
name
to
your
exclusive
product
You
can
even
record
the
recipe
on
computer
so
that
you
can
re-order
the
exact
fragrance
at
later
date
The
âfactoryâ
is
set
in
pretty
18th-century
colonial
mansion
replica;
five-minute
tours
take
visitors
into
the
small
commercial
production
plant
where
some
of
the
Factoryâs
own
signature
perfumes
are
made
Make
your
way
past
the
Continental
Pavilion
at
the
back
of
the
International
Bazaar
to
reach
Goombay
Market
Here
youâll
find
an
amazing
range
of
straw
work
wooden
carvings
and
other
handicrafts
There
are
over
100
stalls
so
itâs
great
place
to
barter
for
bargain
Next
door
to
the
International
Bazaar
is
the
Princess
Casino
with
its
distinctive
Moorish
domes
Youâll
be
able
to
play
alongside
the
âhigh
rollersâ
at
the
roulette
or
craps
tables
or
put
few
coins
in
the
slot
machines
There
is
also
theater
that
hosts
nightly
dance
show
performances
The
casino
is
part
of
the
complex
of
the
Bahamas
Princess
Resort
and
Casino
where
youâll
also
find
country
club
and
two
excellent
18-hole
golf
courses
Lucaya
is
set
on
fine
sandy
beach
and
the
expansive
Port
Lucaya
marina
gives
the
whole
resort
very
nautical
feel
number
of
large

line
the
Lucayan
Beach
their
massive
faÃ§ades
softened
by
the
hundreds
of
masts
of
the
yachts
moored
on
the
inlet
As
of
late
1999
the
casinos
and
many
of
the
hotels
were
being

Port
Lucaya
Marketplace
is
the
center
of
all
activity
for
the
town
During
the
day
the
duty-free
shops
in
this
Mediterranean-style
shopping
village
tempt
shoppers
with
jewelry
clothing
and
perfume;
colorful
wooden
huts
house

stalls
selling
straw
work
and

As
the
sun
sinks
people
gather
at
the
marketplace
after
day
on
the
beach
or
sailing
offshore
The
streets
come
alive
as

accessible
from
the
main
beach
road
is
the
Underwater
Explorers
Society
or
UNEXSO
The
oldest
diving
organization
in
the
Bahamas
UNEXSO
provides
diving

of
diving
to
the
modern
SCUBA

is
the
Lucayan
Golf
and
Country

which
has
some
of
the
best-groomed

Freeport-Lucaya
may
be
modern
town
of
concrete
and
tarmac
but
within
the
city
limits
are
two
natural
areas
that
could
be
million
miles
away
from
the
bustle
of
the
shops
and
large
hotels
Rand
Memorial
Nature
Centre
on
100
acres
of
land
on
East
Settlers
Way
to
the
east
of
Freeport
is
used
as
resource
for
students
on
the
island
but
thereâs
nothing
dry
and
academic
about
it
Here
you
can
learn
about
the
plants
native
to
the
Bahamas
and
find
out
which
ones
were
used
for
bush
medicine
and
for
what
purpose
flock
of
flamingos
and
numerous
other
native
bird
species
make
their
home
here
To
the
east
of
Lucaya
on
Midshipman
Road
is
Parrot
Jungleâs
Garden
of
the
Groves
This
beautiful
garden
was
created
in
tribute
to
Wallace
Groves
and
his
wife
and
the
11
acres
(41â2
hectares)
contain
more
than
10,000
different
plant
species
The
landscaping
is
delightful
with
ponds
waterfalls
and
shady
places
to
sit
and
enjoy
the
view
pretty
chapel
atop
small
hill
offers
fine
vantage
point
over
the
whole
park
For
the
child
in
all
of
us
the
small
petting
zoo
is
great
fun
Beyond
Freeport-Lucaya
Grand
Bahama
is
relatively
easy
to
explore
by
car
with
only
one
major
road
running
east
to
McLeanâs
Town
and
another
north
to
West
End
Eastern
Grand
Bahama
As
you
head
east
out
of
town
youâll
soon
leave
the
trappings
of
modernity
behind
and
find
yourself
on
good
road
through
acres
of
Bahamian
forest
The
road
crosses
number
of
canals
and
just
off
the
south
coast
is
Petersons
Cay
tiny
but
beautiful
coral
cay
with
beachÂ âÂ a
great
spot
for
day
of
swimming
snorkeling
sunbathing
and
picnicking
After
traveling
approximately
10
miles
on
the
main
road
youâll
come
to
Lucaya
National
Park
(thereâs
small
parking
lot
on
your
left)
The
40-acre
(16-hectare)
park
sits
on
both
sides
of
the
main
road
and
protects
range
of
Bahamian
ecosystems
Inland
trails
lead
to
one
of
the
largest
surveyed
cave
systems
in
the
world
much
of
which
lies
underwater
Benâs
Cave
also
known
as
Bats
Cave
for
reasons
that
will
be
obvious
when
you
enter
is
the
most
accessible
and
in
fact
rather
small
It
links
to
the
larger
caves
through
subterranean
tunnels
The
pool
in
the
bottom
has
layers
of
fresh
water
lying
on
top
of
salt
water
Remains
of
several
Lucayan
Indians
that
were
found
at
the
cave
entrance
are
now
being
studied
in
Nassau
The
caves
are
also
home
to
rare
species
of
crustacean
spelonectes
Lucayensis
which
is
said
to
resemble
swimming
centipede
Benâs
Cave
is
closed
during
June
and
July
to
protect
the
bats
during
the
breeding
season
From
the
right-hand
side
of
the
road
well-marked
trails
lead
through
the
vegetation
and
out
toward
the
coast
just
few
hundred
meters
away
(a
line
of
casuarina
trees
marks
the
spot)
Wooden
walkways
lead
you
farther
out
over
tidal
mangrove
swamp
to
Gold
Rock
Beach
One
of
the
most
beautiful
beaches
on
the
island
Gold
Rock
must
really
be
seen
at
low
tide
to
appreciate
its
full
glory
At
high
tide
shallow
layer
of
water
only
couple
of
inches
deep
covers
much
of
the
beach
leaving
only
narrow
arc
of
sand
above
the
waterline
This
whole
area
can
also
be
explored
by
bicycle
or
kayak
or
by
taking
an
eco-tour

Western
Grand
Bahama
Heading
west
from
Freeport-Lucaya
youâll
first
travel
past
the
cruise
port
and
container
port
Across
from
the
entrance
to
the
cruise
port
is
Pier
One
Restaurant
where
you
can
enjoy
wonderful
food
and
feed
the
sharks
that
gather
underneath
the
terraces
in
the
evening
Farther
west
at
Deadmanâs
Reef
are
the
remains
of
an
ancient
Lucayan
settlement
discovered
in
1996
The
last
settlement
on
the
journey
is
West
End
the
oldest
town
on
the
island
and
today
home
to
conch
fishermen
Native
Bahamians
like
to
gather
here
on
the
weekends;
thereâs
always
âfish
fryâ
(kind
of
like
large
communal
barbecue)
and
plenty
of
Kalik
beer
for
sale
During
the
rest
of
the
week
the
village
takes
on
sleepy
air
Thereâs
little
evidence
left
of
the
bad
old
days
of
Prohibition
when
merchants
and
rum-runners
here
made
fortunes
smuggling
liquor
into
the
United
States
The
Out
Islands
The
Bahamas
has
traditionally
been
divided
into
three
entities:
New
Providence
Grand
Bahama
and
all
the
rest
of
the
islands
brought
together
under
the
collective
name
of
the
Out
Islands
sometimes
also
referred
to
as
the
Family
Islands
Most
of
the
Out
Islands
are
sparsely
populated
and
the
traditional
ways
of
island
life
are
much
more
prevalent
than
they
are
on
the
two
main
islands
The
rhythm
of
life
is
slower
communities
are
smaller
and
time
seems
to
stand
still
What
activity
there
is
centers
around
the
boats
that
continually
move
quietly
in
and
out
of
the
harbors
The
Abacos
vaguely
boomerang-shaped
cluster
of
islands
east
of
Grand
Bahama
the
Abacos
offer
perfect
waters
to
explore
by
boat
Stretching
for
some
130
miles
the
Abaco
group
consists
of
âmainlandâ
Little
Abaco
and
Great
Abaco
and
an
attendant
string
of
hundreds
of
cays
and
islets
They
are
sailorâs
paradise
because
the
numerous
safe
anchorages
and
bays
have
been
enhanced
in
modern
times
by
comprehensive
back-up
facilities
for
sailors
The
Abacos
were
settled
by
English
Loyalists
during
and
after
the
American
Revolution
who
brought
with
them
the
distinctive
architectural
and
decorative
style
of
New
England
These
new
immigrants
made
living
from
cotton
production
and
collecting
sponges
but
after
several
disastrous
harvests
and
fierce
hurricane
group
of
Abaconians
left
to
create
sister
community
on
Key
West
off
the
southern
tip
of
Florida
The
people
of
the
Abacos
remained
staunchly
pro-British
even
into
modern
times
and
of
all
the
Bahamians
they
were
the
ones
who
expressed
the
most
apprehension
about
the
bid
for
independence
in
1973
Marsh
Harbour
in
the
center
of
Great
Abaco
Island
is
the
proverbial
heart
of
the
Abacos
The
town
has
large
harbor
and
has
grown
into
major
sailing
center
It
is
now
the
third-largest
settlement
in
the
Bahamas
after
Nassau
and
Freeport-Lucaya
Ships
chandlers
and
hardware
stores
provide
everything
needed
for
the
boats
and
liquor
stores
and
supermarkets
have
everything
for
the
passengers
and
crew
number
of
restaurants
in
and
around
the
wide
marina
and
bay
provide
opportunities
for
intimate
dining
experiences
or
rowdier

sing-alongs
Although
it
is
difficult
to
get
to
all
the
outlying
cays
without

When
it
was
built
in
1864
it
helped
drastically
reduce
the
number
of
shipping
accidents
and
shipwrecks
but
it
was
unpopular
with
the
native
people
who
relied
on
lucrative
salvage
activities
to
make

slender
Eleuthera
(pronounced
âe-LOOTH-raâ)
extends
100
miles
(160

has
many
stretches
that
are
barely
half

wide
Some
of
the
wildest
Bahamian
landscapes
are
to
be
found
on
this
island
that
seems
to
be
more
in
touch
with
the
moods
of
the

Modern
Bahamian
history
began
on
this
island
in
1648
when
the
Eleutherian
Adventurers
led
by
William
Sayle
arrived
from
Britain
and
Bermuda
and
founded
their
shaky
colony
They
landed
near
the
site
of
Governorâs
Harbour
on
the
middle
of
the
island
but
after
period
of
feuding
Sayle
and
some
of
his
followers
moved
north
to
Harbour
Island
and
Spanish
Wells
Their
descendants
still
live
there
today
Although
they
named
the
island
Eleuthera
you
may
find
that
the
local
people
call
the
island
Cigatoo
its
old
Lucayan
name
Harbour
Island
called
âBrilandâ
by
the
locals
sits
off
the
northeastern
corner
of
the
main
island
You
can
reach
it
via
15-minute
ride
on
small
ferry;
taxis
from

Airport
run
reliable
service
to
the
docks
for

The
islandâs
main
town
Dunmore
Town
is
cluster
of
narrow

lined
by
clapboard
houses
festooned
with

be
the
main
ways
the
inhabitants
earned
living;
rum
production
also
made
the
town
popular
with
Americans
during
Prohibition
Now
tourism
is
the
major
industry
Bay
Street
runs
along
the
harbor-front
where
youâll
find
small
straw
marketÂ âÂ five
or
six
colorful
stalls
hugging
the
beachÂ âÂ and
the
tourist
office
at
the
end
of
the
jetty
Wandering
around
(you
can
stroll
over
the
entire
island
in
few
hours)
youâll
find
the
Loyalist
Cottage
late-18th-century
settlerâs
home
as
well
as
several
simple
churches
including
the
oldest
Anglican
church
in
the
Bahamas
St
Johnâs
number
of
souvenir
shops
in
the
houses
have
some
interesting
Bahamian
and
European
gifts
The
beautiful
pink
sand
beach
on
the
Atlantic
side
of
the
island
is
also
big
draw
The
five
miles
of
sand
are
beautiful
sight
especially
in
the
early
morning
or
just
before
sunset
when
the
color
reflects
more
deeply
Any
of
the
several
luxury
hotels
tucked
just
behind
the
dunes
make
good
base
for
the
beach
or
the
delights
of
the
town
only
few
minutesâ
walk
away
Just
off
the
northern
tip
of
Eleuthera
is
Spanish
Wells
In
the
16th
century
the
Spaniards
sank
well
here
to
supply
their
treasure
fleets
with
fresh
water
for
the
long
journey
back
across
the
Atlantic
The
people
of
Spanish
Wells
are
noted
seamen
and
farmers
(they
were
given
land
to
farm
on
the
main
island
in
the
18th
century);
many
still
make
their
living
by
fishing
for
crawfish
grouper
yellowtail
and
conch
or
by
building
boats
though
the
best-known
local
product
is
perhaps
the
wide-brimmed

Not
as
much
tourist
resort
as
Harbour
Island
this
quiet
settlement
nevertheless
attracts
visitors
with
its
beaches

and
miles
of

reef
particularly
good
for

The
Spanish
Wells
Museum
(open
MonâSat
10amâ12pm
and
1â3pm)
records
the
islandâs
history
and
culture
On
the
northern
coast
of
Eleuthera
Island
is
Preacherâs
Cave
the
spot
where
the
original
adventurers
are
said
to
have
been
shipwrecked
It
is
cathedral-like
in
its
dimensions
The
settlers
wrote
their
names
in
charcoal
on
the
walls
of
the
cavern
and
erected
stone
altar
for
their
services
(unfortunately
the
entrance
to
the
cave
is
now
littered
with
rubbish
left
by
modern
travelers)
Several
deserted
beaches
nearby
including
Preacherâs
Cay
Beach
Bain
Bay
and
Ridley
Head
offer
opportunities
for
solitude
or
very
good
close-to-shore
snorkeling

Eleuthera
Airport
the
island
narrows
to
rocky
ridge
just
80
ft
(24
m)
wide
Over
the
millennia
an
arched
hole
had
been
created
here
by
the
pounding
of
the
waves
of
the
Atlantic;
known
as
the
Glass
Window
this
opening
made
it
possible
for
sailors
on
the
Exuma
Sound
to
see
âthrough
the
islandâ
to
the
Atlantic
The
natural
bridge
that
had
been
formed
at
the
top
of
the
arch
collapsed
years
ago
during
hurricane
and
today
you
pass
over
the
still
dramatic
gap
from
north
to
central
Eleuthera
on
the
man-made
Glass
Window
Bridge
The
bridge
requires
continual
maintenance
because
storms
hurricanes
high
winds
and
heavy
seas
take
constant
toll;
in
turbulent
weather
the
Atlantic
rises
in
great
waves
pushing
towards
the
still
calm
Caribbean
The
first
settlement
after
Glass
Window
Bridge
is
Gregory
Town
pretty
hillside
community
of
colorful
houses
overlooking
tiny
harbor
This
is
the
capital
of

Halfway
down
the
island
is
Governorâs
Harbour
photogenic
town
set
on
the
sheltered
eastern
coastline
It
is
major
center
for
sailors
who
come
here
to
stock
up
on
all
the
essentials
obtain
spare
parts
and
have
repairs
done
Windermere
Island
just
off
the
east
coast
was
once
the
place
to
be
in
the
Bahamas
but
its
smart
resort
hotel
is
now
closed
Jacques
Cousteau
had
home
here
and
used
it
as
base
for
exploring
the
seas
around
the
other
Bahamian
islands
Southern
Eleuthera
is
served
by
an
airport
near
the
little
town
of
Rock
Sound
which
is
famed
for
its
blue
hole
which
Jacques
Cousteau
spent
time
investigating
Although
it
is
only
half
mile
from
the
Caribbean
side
of
the
island
it
actually
reaches
out
several
miles
to
the
Atlantic
Ocean
and
has
yet
to
be
fully
explored
Andros
Andros
is
the
largest
island
of
the
BahamasÂ âÂ at
little
over
100
miles
(160
km)
long
and
40
miles
(64
km)
wide
itâs
almost
four
times
larger
than
any
other
island
in
the
CommonwealthÂ âÂ though
much
of
its
territory
is
covered
by
uninhabitable
mangrove
swamp
and
coral
limestone
escarpments
divided
by
wide
creeks
The
island
is
fringed
by
miles
of
shallow
sand
flats
on
the
west
and
ringed
by
coral
reef
on
the
east
Perhaps
because
of
its
vastness
and
rugged
terrain
Andros
became
favorite
of
the
pirate
fleets;
one
of
its
major
settlements
is
called
Morganâs
Bluff
after
the
pirate
leader
Henry
Morgan
who
is
said
to
have
buried
treasure
on
one
of
the
beaches
in
the
area
In
1821
group
of
Seminole
Indians
left
their
native
Florida
and
settled
on
the
northern
tip
of
the
island
Their
descendants
still
live
around
the
town
of
Red
Bays
practicing
the
skills
of
basket
weaving
for
which
they
are
greatly
admired
Their
work
which
is
of
extremely
high
quality
is
said
to
be
so
tightly
woven
that
the
baskets
can
hold
water
The
family
of
Neville
Chamberlain
the
British
Prime
Minister
who
attempted
to
negotiate
with
Hitler
before
World
War
II
created
sisal
farm
on
the
island
but
the
attempt
failed
miserably
Andros
is
famed
for
its
natural
attractions:
It
has
the
third
longest
barrier
reef
in
the
world
lying
just
one
mile
(11â2
km)
offshore
and
stretching
140
miles
(225
km)
down
the
east
coast
This
makes
it
popular
destination
with
divers
who
come
to
explore
the
tidal
shallows
the
reef
and
the
deep
reef
walls
which
plunge
6,000
ft
(1,829
m)
down
into
the
Tongue
of
the
Ocean
the
deep
passage
between
Andros
and
New
Providence
Numerous
species
of
sea
life
flourish
at
every
level
and
contribute
to
the
abundant
variety
of
diving
environments
available
for
all
ability
levels
Experienced
divers
also
come
to
explore
the
numerous
so-called
âblue
holesâ
that
dot
the
interior
of
the
island
Created
by
erosion
of
the
limestone
rock
these
holes
have
layer
of
fresh
water
that
lies
on
top
and
tidal
sea
water
below;
sea
water
forced
in
through
countless
underground
fissures
causes
their
water
levels
to
rise
or
fall
with
the
tides
Andros
is
awash
with
fresh
water
which
is
put
to
good
use:
over
million
gallons
are
pumped
into
tankers
each
day
and
shipped
across
to
New
Providence
where
fresh
water
is
much
in
demand
The
miles
of
shallow
âflatsâ
that
meet
the
mangrove
swamps
along
the
west
coast
are
an
ideal
environment
for
bonefish
and
Andros
lays
claim
to
being
the
Bonefishing
Capital
of
the
World
The
fishing
is
extremely
challenging
either
from
boats
off
the
island
or
by
wading
in
the
shallows
just
offshore
Onshore
Andros
is
bird
watcherâs
paradiseÂ âÂ hardwood
forests
of
Bahamian
mahogany
and
mangrove
and
smaller
areas
of
pine
offer
varied
habitat
to
over
120
native
and
migratory
species
Most
of
the
major
settlements
lie
along
the
eastern
side
of
the
island
They
are
widely
scattered
from
Congo
Town
in
the
south
through
Andros
Town
to
Nicholls
Town
in
the
north
Getting
around
the
island
is
time
consuming
and
difficult
because
it
is
divided
by
wide
creeks
swamps
and
lakes
but
each
of
these
main
settlements
is
served
by
an
airport
At
Andros
Town
known
as
Fresh
Creek
to
local
people
there
are
few
facilities
for
visitors
and

One
of
the
most
popular
Bahamian
souvenirs
is
produced
nearby
Androsia
batikÂ âÂ brightly
colored
cotton
fabric
with
tropical
fish
turtle
or
fruit
motifsÂ âÂ is
hand-produced
at
small
factory
just
outside
the
capital
You
can
watch
the
patterns
being
pressed
in
wax
onto
the
white
cotton
fabric
and
view
the
skeins
as
theyâre
allowed
to
dry
naturally
in
the
warm
Bahamian
sun
The
finished
batik
is
then
used
to
make
clothing
and
other
products
in
the
small
factory
next
door
The
products
are
available
in
shops
all
over
the
Bahamas
but
you
can
save
good
deal
by
buying
direct
from
the
factory
The
Exumas
Running
in
100-mile
(160-km)
chain
directly
south
of
New
Providence
the
Exumas
have
cay
for
every
day
of
the
year
though
some
of
these
tiny
islands
are
only
few
hundred
square
feet
in
size
and
most
are
uninhabited
The
breathtaking
waters
surrounding
these
islands
ranging
from
turquoise
blue
to
jade
green
are
sailorâs
delight
and
numerous
yachts
can
be
seen
weaving
around
the
sandy
shallows
and
cutting
through
to
deeper
water
The
name
Exuma
is
said
to
be
derivation
of
the
two
Lucayan
Indian
words
that
had
been
used
for
this
group
of
islands
yumey
and
suma
The
largest
Exuma
Cays
were
settled
by
British
Loyalists
following
the
American
Revolution
Chief
among
these
was
Dennis
Rolle
who
brought
over
100
slaves
with
him
to
start
cotton
plantation
This
venture
began
to
fail
after
only
few
years
but
Dennis
passed
the
land
onto
his
son
John
In
1834
slavery
was
abolished
and
John
Rolle
freed
his
slaves
and
deeded
the
Rolle
land
on
to
them
âin
commonageâ
at
his
death
This
allowed
only
those
directly
related
to
the
Rolle
slaves
to
farm
or
build
on
the
inherited
land
Today
most
of
the
native
inhabitants
of
the
Exumas
bear
the
family
name
Rolle
The
Exumas
are
divided
into
three
distinct
sections:
Great
Exuma
Island
Little
Exuma
Island
and
the
Exhuma
Cays
which
lie
north
of
the
main
islands
The
capital
George
Town
on
Great
Exuma
Island
is
served
by
regular
flights
from
Nassau
and
makes
the
most
convenient
base
for
non-sailors
It
has
sleepy
and
laid-back
atmosphere
and
offers

Cat
Island
Cat
Islanders
can
still
be
said
to
be
living
little
in
the
past
For
one
thing
they
dispute
nearby
San
Salvadorâs
claim
to
be
the
landing
place
of
Columbus;
they
still
feel
as
archaeologists
and
historians
used
to
that
the
explorer
first
made
landfall
on
their
island
The
Cat
Islanders
also
retain
powerful
attachment
to
obeah
the
world
of
spirits
and
natural
healing
The
island
itself
also
has
peculiarities
that
separate
it
from
other
Bahamian
Islands
It
is
the
most
undulating
of
the
islands;
one
could
even
call
it
hilly
with
the
highest
point
of
land
in
the
Commonwealth
Mount
Alvernia
rising
to
the
heady
heights
of
216
ft
(66m)
above
sea
level
Many
visitors
come
to
this
island
named
after
an
English
sea
captain
called
Catt
for
its
beautiful
quiet
beaches
Fernandez
Bay
with
its
arc
of
fine
sand
on
the
protected
western
side
of
the
island
is
said
to
be
the
finest
in
the
Bahamas
and
the
nearby
beach
at
Old
Bight
is
not
far
behind
in
terms
of
beauty
Though
you
canât
go
wrong
anywhere
on
the
western
coast
Mount
Alvernia
in
the
center
of
the
island
is
not
far
from
the
airfield
at
New
Bight
This
settlement
originally
served
as
hermitage
for
Father
Jerome
an
Anglican
missionary
who
had
converted
to
Catholicism
and
become
an
influential
churchman
on
the
Out
Islands
responsible
for
the
erection
of
number
of
Catholic
Churches
Father
Jerome
built
small
Hermitage
on
the
heights
of
Mount
Alvernia
that
youâll
see
as
you
reach
the
summit
(a
15-minute
walk
from
rudimentary
car
park);
the
missionary
was
buried
in
small
hilltop
cave

upon
his
death
in
1956

age
of

San
Salvador
This
tiny
patch
of
land
63
sq
miles
in
area
is
at
the
center
of
momentous
turning
point
in
history
for
it
was
here
that
Christopher
Columbus
first
made
landfall
in
the
New
World
on
12
October
1492
One
can
only
imagine
the
relief
of
his
crew
and
perhaps
Columbusâs
own
sense
of
satisfaction
that
his
theories
had
proved
to
be
correct
(though
not
entirely
since
he
assumed
he
had
found
the
Indian
subcontinent)
Around
the
shoreline
of
San
Salvador
are
four
separate
places
that
are
purported
to
be
the
site
of
Columbusâs
landing
No
one
will
ever
know
for
sure
of
course
but
the
competition
continues
After
the
Spaniards
went
on
to
other
islands
in
the
Caribbean
the
island
became
base
for
English
pirate
John
Watling;
indeed
until
1926
it
was
known
as
Watlingâs
Island
The
interior
of
San
Salvador
is
dotted
with
lakes;
there
is
great
deal
of
marshy
land
and
only
one
major
road
Cockburn
Town
(pronounced
âKOE-burnâ)
is
the
capital
Pride
of
place
in
the
town
goes
to
the
small
jail
found
by
the
main
coast
road
Itâs
now
museum
because
as
one
resident
said
âwe
donât
have
no
need
for
no
jail.â
(The
opening
hours
are
irregular.)
The
main
road
leads
around
the
circumference
of
the
island
Heading
south
from
Cockburn
Town
youâll
first
come
to
Long
Bay
the
âofficialâ
site
of
Columbusâs
landing
It
is
marked
by
plain
white
cross
that
sits
bright
and
stark
against
the
azure-blue
ocean
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
road
The
area
has
been
designated
as
Landfall
Park
Another
monument
to
the
1968
Olympics
in
Mexico
sits
little
way
from
the
cross
This
depiction
of
the
Olympic
rings
on
circular
plinth
is
here
because
the
Olympic
flame
was
brought
to
San
Salvador
on
its
way
to
Mexico
At
the
northeastern
corner
of
the
island
is
Dixon
Hill
Lighthouse
Built
in
1856
but
improved
in
subsequent
years
it
is
called
the
last
hand-operated
kerosene-powered
lighthouse
in
the
Bahamas
Its
beam
can
be
seen
for
some
20
miles
(32
km)
San
Salvador
has
developed
reputation
as
one
of
the
best
places
in
the
Bahamas
for
reef
wall
diving
The
walls
off
the
western
coast
are
almost
vertical
in
places
and
schools
of
hammerheads
can
be
seen
regularly
in
the
pristine
waters
The
island
has
only
two
hotels
but
well-organized
dive
center
runs
professional
program
for
those
who
want
to
explore
the
seas
off
the
island
Long
Island
When
Columbus
sighted
this
island
he
stated
that
it
was
the
most
beautiful
that
he
had
ever
seen
He
named
it
Fernandina
in
honor
of
the
King
of
Spain
but
the
English
called
it
Long
Island
because
of
its
appearanceÂ âÂ 66
miles
(106
km)
long
and
no
more
than
miles
(61â2
km)
in
width
The
Spaniards
wiped
out
the
population
of
Lucayan
Indians
who
lived
here
and
the
island
remained
unpopulated
for
over
200
years
until
it
was
settled
by
number
of
Loyalist
families
from
the
American
colonies
They
attempted
to
grow
cotton
in
the
thin
layer
of
soil
but
were
unsuccessful
and
at
the
announcement
of
emancipation
they
abandoned
the
island
leaving
their
slaves
behind
Today
excitement
centers
on
the
resort
of
Stella
Maris
in
the
north
which
was
developed
in
the
1960s
by
group
of
German
businessmen
One
of
the
premier
diving
sites
in
the
Bahamas
the
resort
was
one
of
the
first
to
develop
shark-feeding
programs
at
Shark
Reef
famous
feeding
grounds
of
these
formidable
creatures
The
waters
sweep
over
dozens
of
pretty
beaches
and
rocky
outcrops
provide
ideal
areas
for
snorkeling
The
finest
beach
is
at
the
very
northern
tip
of
the
islandÂ âÂ Cape
Santa
Maria
(named
by
Columbus
after
his
own
ship)
is
vast
empty
expanse
of
yellow
sand
and
blue

Long
Islandâs
one
main
road
runs
like
backbone
down
its

This
highway
creates
an
artificial
divide
between
the
two
very
different

Traveling
south
from
Stella

youâll
pass
uninhabited
mangrove
swamps
on
the
way
to
the
small
town
of
Simms
an
unhurried
old
settlement
known
for
its
distinctive
straw-work
which
craftswomen
are
delighted
to
show
visitors
At
Deadmanâs

youâll
find
an
extensive
cave
system
with
faded
Lucayan

After
passing
small
pineapple
and
banana
plantations
youâll
reach
attractive
Clarence

with
its
two
large
churchesÂ âÂ one
Anglican

Turtle
Cove
half-mile
walk
from
the
road
over
rough
terrain
provides
memorable
diving
experience
though
itâs
interesting
even
from
the
rim
The
hole
is
about
80
yards
(73
m)
across
and
at
least
600
ft
(183
m)
deep;
youâll
sometimes
see
large
turtles
and
tarpon
in
the
waters
Crooked
Island
and
Acklins
Island
These
two
islands
lie
225
miles
(360
km)
south
of
Nassau
and
are
totally
off
the
beaten
path
for
most
tourists
today
though
they
were
often
visited
during
the
age
of
steam
ships
Columbus
described
them
as
âthe
fragrant
islandsâ
after
the
smell
of
cascarilla
an
indigenous
tree;
the
bark
is
major
ingredient
in
perfumes
medicines
and
in
the
Italian
aperitif
Campari
The
Ocean
Den
marine
cave
system
in
the
Bight
of
Acklins
is
one
of
the
most
impressive
in
the
Bahamas
The
totally
unspoiled
long
sandy
beaches
provide
rich
environment
for
birds
and
animal
life
The
area
to
the
west
of
the
two
islands
is
shallow
sheltered
lagoon
where
many
small
cays
offer
protection
to
rare
species
of
iguana
Crooked
Island
has
challenging
diving
sites
particularly
along
the
reef
wall
off
its
northern

though
there
are

tourist
facilities
and
as
yet
no
major
plans
to
expand

Mayaguana
Island
This
island
75
miles
(120
km)
east
of
Acklins
Island
is
perhaps
the
least
visited
and
least
developed
of
all
the
inhabited
Bahamas
islands
It
has
few
telephones
and

Many
of

the
1920s
and
had
been
left
to
decay
as
Miami
spread
to
the
west
and
other
areas
became
more
popular
Then
in
the
1980s
as
developers
began
to
regain
interest
in
the
area
group
of
architects
began
campaign
to
save
the
Art

masterpieces
and
South

was
reborn
Today
it
is
one
of
the
most
fashionable
places
on

stars
mix
with

Brief
History
In
ancient
Greek
mythology
Athens
is
named
following
contest
between
Athena
goddess
of
wisdom
and
Poseidon
god
of
the
sea
Both
had
their
eye
on
the
prize
real
estate
so
it
was
agreed
that
whoever
could
come
up
with
the
more
useful
gift
for
mortals
would
win
The
half-human
half-serpent
king
of
Athens
Cecrops
acted
as
arbiter
First
came
Poseidon
who
struck
the
rock
of
the
Acropolis
with
his
mighty
trident
and
brought
salt
water
gushing
forth
Then
it
was
Athenaâs
turn
As
she
struck
the
rock
an
olive
tree
appeared
which
proved
more
useful
and
valuable
Thus
she
acquired
the
position
of
the
cityâs
special
protector
The
actual
history
of
the
city-state
of
Athens
is
just
as
fascinating
as
its
mythology
From
around
2000
b.c
wandering
bands
filtered
into
Greece
from
Asia
Minor
Known
as
Achaeans
they
were
the
first
Greek-speaking
people
in
the
area
and
over
the
centuries
they
built
many
imposing
fortresses
and
developed
the
rich
Mycenaean
civilization
based
in
the
Peloponnese
The
citadel
at
Mycenae
seat
of
this
most
powerful
of
early
Greek
cultures
was
erected
to
the
south
of
Athens
Surrounded
by
pair
of
precipitous
ravines
the
imposing
walls
of
the
citadel
were
some
forty
feet
high
and
twenty
feet
thick
virtually
impregnable
The
Achaeansâ
chief
rivals
and
mentors
were
the
dazzling
Minoans
of
CreteÂ âÂ until
about
1450
b.c.
when
the
Minoan
empire
was
devastated
possibly
by
tidal
waves
caused
by
the
eruption
of
the
volcanic
island
of
Thera
(Santorini)
From
the
seafaring
Minoans
the
Myceneans
learned
to
make
bronze
by
combining
copper
and
tin
and
with
no
written
language
of
their
own
they
adpated
the
linear
script
used
by
Minoan
scribes
For
several
centuries
the
Mycenaeans
dominated
the
eastern
Mediterranean
and
Aegean
long
series
of
conflicts
however
including
the
legendary
siege
of
Troy
weakened
these
mighty
mainland
warriors
Around
1100
b.c
waves
of
Dorians
swept
into
the
area
on
horseback
Armed
with
iron
spears
and
shields
they
overpowered
the
Bronze
Age
weapons
of
Mycenae
and
broke
down
the
Peloponnesian
bastions
The
ensuing
âdark
ageâ
lasted
about
three
centuries
and
resulted
in
large-scale
emigrations
of
Greeks
around
the
Mediterranean
Athens
managed
to
escape
the
scourge
but
only
after
700
b.c
did
it
take
over
and
lift
to
unimagined
heights
the
heritage
of
Mycenae
and
Crete
Although
they
warred
as
often
as
they
united
the
citizens
of
Athens
and
surrounding
city-states
on
the
Attica
peninsula
notably
Sparta
and
Thebes
shared
sense
of
identity
They
were
all
Greeksâââthey
had
common
tongue
and
an
evolving
pan-Hellenic
religion
and
at
regular
intervals
they
were
brought
together
by
the
ritual
athletic
contest
of
the
Olympian
Delphian
and
Isthmian
games
Athens
the
largest
city-state
gradually
embraced
all
of
the
Attica
peninsula
King
Theseus
the
legendary
ruler
who
slew
the
minotaur
in
the
Cretan
labyrinth
was
revered
by
Athenians
for
bringing
Atticaâs
scattered
and
independent
villages
under
the
rule
of
the
Acropolis
Countless
urns
and
jars
were
decorated
with
drawings
of
his
heroic
exploits
but
in
fact
he
belongs
to
myth
rather
than
to
history
The
villages
actually
merged
with
Athens
in
exchange
for
protection
share
of
state
offices
and
full
citizenship
rights
From
Aristocracy
to
Democracy
During
the
dark
ages
Athens
had
been
monarchy
but
it
emerged
as
an
oligarchy
in
the
seventh
century
b.c
The
first
great
historical
figure
of
that
new
era
was
SolonÂ âÂ general
merchant
poet
and
sageÂ âÂ who
in
594
b.c
became
chief
magistrate
At
that
time
civil
war
threatened
to
break
out
between
the
city-stateâs
âhavesâ
and
âhave
notsâ
(an
expression
from
ancient
Greece)
Armed
with
almost
absolute
powers
Solon
produced
constitution
advancing
the
ideal
of
equality
before
the
law
for
citizens
of
all
classes
set
up
trial-by-jury
system
freed
the
peasantry
from
debt
to
landowners
and
introduced
far-sighted
reforms
that
revived
the
languishing
economy
In
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
Athensâ
first
dictator
took
power
Peisistratus
established
dynasty
that
remained
in
uninterrupted
power
for
half
century
On
one
occasion
when
he
was
forced
from
power
Peisistratus
dressed
tall
beautiful
country
girl
to
look
like
the
goddess
Athena
and
then
entered
Athens
in
triumph
with
the
âgoddessâ
leading
his
procession
Peisistratus
resourceful
and
relatively
benign
tyrant
continued
to
steer
Athens
towards
greatness
Under
his
rule
commerce
and
the
arts
flourished:
Atticaâs
wine
and
olive
oil
were
shipped
to
Italy
Egypt
and
Asia
Minor
in
beautiful
black-figure
pots;
the
first
tragedies
ever
written
were
performed
at
the
annual
festival
of
the
wine
god
Dionysus;
and
the
standard
version
of
Homerâs
works
was
set
down
However
Peisistratusâ
successors
proved
less
popular
and
democracy
was
eventually
re-established
by
force
Cleisthenes
recognized
by
history
as
the
true
founder
of
Athenian
democracy
took
over
in
508
b.c
An
aristocrat
by
birth
he
introduced
electoral
constituencies
called
demes
and
set
up
sovereign
citizensâ
assembly
and
senate
whose
members
were
chosen
by
lot
The
foundations
of
representation
had
truly
been
set
He
also
introduced
an
inspired
system
of
âostracismâ
under
which
any
public
servant
who
was
voted
inept
tyrannical
or
corrupt
by
the
citizenry
was
banished
from
Athens
for
ten
years
though
he
was
allowed
to
keep
his
property
The
Persian
Wars
At
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
b.c.
Greece
entered
the
period
of
the
Persian
Wars
as
recorded
in
Herodotusâ
great
narrative
history
of
the
ancient
world
(see
page
33)
The
Persian
Empireâs
far-flung
lands
included
number
of
Greek
settlements
on
the
coast
of
what
is
now
Turkey
When
the
Greek
towns
attempted
revolt
in
499
b.c.
Athens
sent
an
expedition
to
aid
their
uprising
The
revolt
failed
but
the
Persian
king
Darius
could
not
let
such
impudence
go
unpunished
and
in
490
b.c
he
confidently
launched
an
invasion
of
Attica
Although
the
Persiansâ
forces
and
resources
were
vastly
superior
Darius
hadnât
anticipated
the
amazing
courage
and
battlefield
skill
of
the
Greeks
fleet
of
around
600
Persian
vessels
landed
troops
at
Marathon
beach
Led
by
General
Miltiades
the
Athenians
inflicted
crippling
and
humiliating
defeat
on
the
Persians
According
to
legend
the
soldier
who
ran
from
Marathon
to
Athensâââa
distance
of
42
km
(26
miles)âââto
report
the
victory
then
died
of
exhaustion
His
feat
is
still
commemorated
today
in
the
Olympic
race
known
as
the
marathon
However
the
Persians
still
held
grudge
and
when
Dariusâ
son
Xerxes
re-invaded
Greece
by
land
and
sea
in
far
greater
strength
ten
years
later
the
Greeksâ
defeat
seemed
inevitable
few
hundred
heroic
troops
under
Leonidas
of
Sparta
delayed
the
enormous
Persian
army
at
the
pass
of
Thermopylae
long
enough
for
the
Athenians
to
be
evacuated
to
the
island
of
Salamis
When
he
finally
arrived
Xerxes
plundered
the
city
burning
down
all
the
wooden
structures
on
the
Acropolis
The
fleet
of
700
Persian
ships
then
engaged
the
much
smaller
Athenian
naval
force
under
the
command
of
Themistocles
in
the
Strait
of
Salamis
but
Xerxes
was
in
for
surprise
With
the
aid
of
brilliant
tactics
and
newer
ships
the
Greek
fleet
trounced
the
Persians
turning
the
tide
in
favor
of
Athens
The
final
decisive
battle
of
the
Persian
Wars
took
place
in
480
b.c
at
Platae
where
Xerxesâ
troops
were
soundly
beaten
Greek
independence
had
been
preserved
again
and
with
it
the
foundations
on
which
Western
civilization
has
been
built
The
Golden
Age
For
almost
50
years
after
Platae
peace
reigned
at
home
and
the
victorious
city-state
entered
its
most
brilliant
era
Athens
was
instrumental
in
bringing
the
disparate
Aegean
and
mainland
communities
together
creating
âleague
of
nationsâ
known
as
the
Delian
League
The
headquarters
of
the
League
was
originally
on
the
island
of
Delos
but
it
was
moved
to
Athens
itself
in
454
b.c
The
resources
of
the
treasury
of
the
Delian
League
were
usedâââamong
other
thingsâââto
build
the
Parthenon
and
other
monuments
that
still
adorn
the
Acropolis
today
The
moving
power
behind
this
unrivaled
time
of
greatness
which
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
Golden
Age
was
Pericles
This
liberal-inclined
aristocrat
was
in
effect
the
supreme
ruler
of
Athens
and
its
empire
for
30
years
until
his
death
in
429
b.c
Great
works
of
art
literature
science
and
philosophy
were
produced
by
what
Pericles
referred
to
as
the
âschool
of
Hellas.â
Major
names
of
the
time
included
the
dramatists
Euripides
and
Sophocles
the
historian
Herodotus
the
philosopher
Socrates
and
the
brilliant
scientists
Zeno
and
Anaxagoras
The
first
literary
salon
in
history
was
presided
over
by
Aspasia
Periclesâ
mistress
remarkable
woman
of
intelligence
and
spirit
During
all
this
the
Athenian
political
system
allowed
the
average
citizen
greater
degree
of
participation
in
public
life
than
ever
before
anywhere
and
perhaps
since
Of
course
the
number
of
citizens
(free
adult
males)
was
smallÂ âÂ probably
not
above
30,000Â âÂ while
the
population
as
whole
including
women
children
resident
aliens
and
slaves
might
have
been
ten
times
as
great
Slavery
was
common
justified
on
the
grounds
that
democracy
could
not
exist
unless
the
citizens
were
free
to
devote
themselves
to
the
service
of
the
state
Most
slaves
in
Athens
were
prisoners
of
war
The
Peloponnesian
War
As
Athens
prospered
intense
economic
and
ideological
rivalry
developed
with
Athensâ
ally
during
the
Persian
Wars
Sparta
In
431
b.c
the
Peloponnesian
War
broke
out
between
them
resulting
in
27
years
of
debilitating
conflict
involving
most
of
the
Greek
world
Yet
literature
and
art
continued
to
flourish
in
spite
of
the
incessant
fighting
and
during
this
time
Athens
built
two
of
the
loveliest
temples
on
the
Acropolis
the
Erechtheion
and
the
temple
to
Athena
Nike
(see
pages
34
and
35)
Finally
Sparta
with
naval
help
from
former
foe
Persia
blockaded
what
was
then
the
Hellespont
(now
the
Dardanelles
Strait)
thus
cutting
off
Athens
from
its
crucial
supply
of
grain
Starvation
and
heavy
naval
losses
proved
too
much
for
Athens
and
the
Spartans
claimed
total
victory
Sparta
attempted
to
govern
the
city
through
council
of
30
men
known
as
the
âThirty
Tyrants,â
who
spent
most
of
their
time
persecuting
opponents
and
confiscating
property
In
less
than
year
they
were
driven
from
the
city
and
Sparta
embroiled
in
other
conflicts
let
Athens
re-establish
its
maritime
alliances
without
resistance
But
Athens
was
never
to
regain
her
earlier
military
or
political
influence
new
star
rose
in
the
northâââthat
of
Philip
II
of
Macedon
father
of
Alexander
the
Great
He
advanced
the
far-sighted
scheme
of
federation
of
Greek
states
which
Athens
resisted
Some
Athenians
even
urged
the
Assembly
to
declare
war
on
the
Macedonian
King
(The
fiery
Philippics
speeches
on
the
subject
by
master
orator
Demosthenes
rate
among
the
finest
of
their
kind.)
Following
defeat
at
the
battle
of
Chaeronea
in
338
b.c.
however
the
Athenians
accepted
an
alliance
with
other
states
and
even
sent
Philip
gold
crown
as
token
of
submission
Yet
culturally
and
intellectually
Athens
still
remained
unsurpassed
through
the
fourth
century
b.c
Aristotle
one
of
the
worldâs
greatest
philosophers
held
forth
at
his
own
school
of
the
Lyceum;
Menander
wrote
comic
plays;
Praxiteles
sculpted
scores
of
superb
statues
including
that
of
Hermes
one
of
the
greatest
Greek
sculptures
now
in
the
museum
at
Olympia
This
age
in
fact
had
an
even
more
lasting
influence
than
that
exerted
by
Athens
during
its
great
âClassicalâ
fifth
century
Rome
and
Byzantium
looked
to
it
for
inspiration
as
Europe
did
in
the
Medieval
and
Renaissance
periods
Roman
Rule
As
the
center
of
power
shifted
from
Athens
to
Alexandria
Macedonian
troops
occupied
Athens
twiceÂ âÂ first
in
322
and
then
in
262
b.c
However
the
Macedonian
Empire
did
not
survive
long
after
Alexanderâs
death
Eventually
after
series
of
wars
it
was
dismantled
by
the
far-ranging
legions
of
Rome
Macedonia
became
just
another
Roman
province
(in
146
b.c.)
and
Athens
not
much
more
than
showplace
museum
city
though
its
philosophy
schools
and
orators
kept
attracting
Romans
with
political
ambitions
Cicero
and
Horace
spent
student
years
in
Athens
and
Emperor
Hadrian
is
said
to
have
been
initiated
into
the
sacred
mysteries
of
Demeter
at
Eleusis
(the
most
famous
secret
religious
rites
of
ancient
Greece;
see
page74)
Although
generally
treated
well
throughout
some
five
centuries
of
Pax
Romana
Athens
suffered
severely
on
one
occasion
In
86
b.c.
Roman
general
Sulla
sacked
the
city
in
retribution
for
its
unwise
alliance
with
Mithridates
King
of
Pontus
and
bitter
enemy
of
Rome
Many
Athenian
treasures
were
carried
off
to
Italy
Athensâ
good
fortune
was
that
the
Romans
held
Greek
culture
in
such
high
esteem
Most
notable
was
the
Emperor
Hadrian
(a.d
76â138)
who
had
love
of
Classical
Greek
architecture
Among
other
monuments
he
erected
his
distinctive
arched
gate
and
completed
the
temple
of
Olympian
Zeus
on
foundations
laid
by
Peisistratus
nearly
seven
centuries
earlier
(see

Byzantine
and
Ottoman
Obscurity
When
Roman
Emperor
Constantine
gave
Christianity
official
sanction
in
326
he
looked
for
âNew
Romeâ
in
the
eastern
Mediterranean
Athens
hoped
to
be
chosen
but
the
title
of
new
capital
went
to
the
former
Greek
colonial
town
of
Byzantium
(Constantinople)
now
Istanbul
Under
Byzantine
rule
the
city
of
Pericles
sank
into
deep
provincial
obscurity
It
merited
only
few
brief
mentions
in
the
history
of
the
following
centuries
Christianity
had
taken
early
root
in
Greece
as
result
of
St
Paulâs
visit
to
Athens
somewhere
around
50
a.d
Polytheism
however
persisted
until
529
when
an
edict
by
Emperor
Justinian
outlawed
the
last
âpaganâ
temples
and
closed
the
famous
Athenian
schools
of
philosophy
From
the
12th
to
14th
centuries
Athens
found
itself
governed
by
number
of
European
nobles
from
Florence
Catalonia
and
Burgundy
In
1456
Athens
and
Attica
were
taken
by
the
Turks
in
their
rampage
across
the
disintegrating
Byzantine
Empire
The
following
four
centuries
of
Ottoman
rule
are
known
as
Greeceâs
darkest
age
Athens
was
all
but
forgotten
Through
this
difficult
period
only
the
Orthodox
Church
could
provide
the
Greek
people
with
any
sense
of
identity
and
continuity
Venetian
forces
attempted
to
wrest
the
city
from
Ottoman
control
twice
The
second
time
in
1687
shell
hit
munitions
store
in
the
ParthenonÂ âÂ badly
damaging
the
2,000-year-old
structure
Independence
Athens
dwindled
ever
further
When
the
poet
Byron
visited
it
in
1809
he
found
that
what
had
once
been
the
glittering
center
of
the
civilized
world
now
had
population
of
only
about
5,000
souls
As
the
nineteenth
century
commenced
swell
of
nationalist
fervor
rose
in
the
oppressed
people
of
Greece
On
25
March
1821
Archbishop
Germanos
raised
new
blue-and-white
banner
in
Patras
in
the
Peloponnese
and
declared
independence
but
it
took
11
years
and
some
formidable
foreign
help
for
the
Greeks
to
win
their
war
against
Turkish
rule
Athens
changed
hands
more
than
once
during
the
long
struggle
in
which
many
English
Scots
Irish
and
French
fought
alongside
the
Greeks
Byron
who
popularized
the
cause
abroad
died
at
Missolonghi
in
1824
(of
disease
not
from
fighting)
On
27
October
1827
the
Greek
revolution
was
won
but
the
last
Turks
werenât
evicted
from
the
Acropolis
until
1833
The
following
year
the
little
town
of
Athens
was
declared
the
capital
of
modern
Greece
Theoretically
sovereign
the
new
state
was
an
artificial
creationÂ âÂ the
result
of
pressure
from
other
European
powersÂ âÂ and
the
17-year-old
Bavarian
Prince
Otto
was
installed
as
king
He
was
deposed
in
1862
but
during
his
reign
Athens
slowly
returned
to
being
city
again
and
Greece
made
considerable
economic
progress
As
result
of
complex
European
diplomatic
talks
second
adolescent
came
to
the
Greek
throne
in
1863
the
18-year-old
William
of
the
Danish
royal
house
Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-GlÃ¼ckburg
He
took
the
name
George
I
King
of
the
Hellenes
and
remained
in
power
for
50
years
until
his
assassination
in
1913
The
20th
Century
The
events
that
have
shaped
modern
Greek
history
have
been
as
interesting
and
chaotic
as
any
in
the
Classical
age
The
dominant
figure
between
1910
and
1935
was
Eleftherios
Venizelos
Cretan
politician
who
was
prime
minister
several
times
He
helped
Greece
regain
Macedonia
and
many
of
the
Aegean
islands
including
his
homeland
of
Crete
Venizelos
was
in
power
during
the
epic
population
exchange
with
Turkey
(1922)
under
which
almost
one
million
repatriated
Greeks
flooded
Athens
The
desperate
makeshift
effort
to
accommodate
them
pushed
back
the
cityâs
boundaries
and
accounts
for
the
oldest
of
the
suburban
eyesores
in
the
capital
Between
1936
and
1940
Greece
was
under
the
military
dictatorship
of
Ioannis
Metaxas
remembered
for
the
resounding
Ã³chi
(ânoâ)
he
gave
in
reply
to
Mussoliniâs
ultimatum
to
surrender
in
1940
The
Greeks
commemorate
the
day
28
October
as
national
holiday
Greece
was
invaded
by
Nazi
Germany
in
April
1941;
by
June
the
Germans
controlled
the
entire
country
with
Italian
forces
placed
in
Athens
The
people
suffered
greatly
but
the
cityâs
monuments
escaped
serious
damage
Unfortunately
the
Greek
resistance
movement
formed
during
the
war
was
so
politically
divided
that
the
guerrillas
expended
almost
as
much
energy
fighting
each
other
as
against
the
Germans
In
October
1944
the
Allied
forces
moved
into
Athens
and
much
of
Greece
encountering
little
opposition
from
the
retreating
Germans
The
war
left
Greece
utterly
devastated
and
the
factions
squabbled
ceaselessly
in
an
attempt
to
gain
political
advantage
Communist
and
royalist
partisans
moved
steadily
toward
military
confrontation
as
the
United
States
under
the
Truman
Doctrine
sent
the
first
economic
aid
Two
years
of
savage
civil
war
ended
in
late
1949
with
Communist
defeat
but
political
instability
persisted
In
1967
military
dictatorship
seized
power
in
Greece
During
the
seven-year
âreign
of
the
colonels,â
as
the
succeeding
years
are
known
political
parties
were
dissolved
the
press
was
censored
and
left-wing
sympathizers
were
exiled
tortured
and
imprisoned
In
November
1973
student
protest
at
the
Athens
Polytechnic
was
brutally
crushed
This
action
spelled
the
end
of
public
tolerance
of
the
regime
which
collapsed
eight
months
later
when
the
junta
attempted
to
overthrow
the
Cypriot
president
Archbishop
Makarios
provoking
the
Turkish
invasion
of
Cyprus
Constantine
Karamanlis
the
former
conservative
premier
was
recalled
from
exile
in
Paris
to
restore
democracy
The
reforms
that
followed
brought
the
abolition
of
the
monarchy
and
new
constitution
for
republican
government
was
drawn
up
in
1975
With
its
entry
into
the
Common
Market
in
1981
Greeceâs
economic
prospects
strengthened
That
same
year
the
first
socialist
government
swept
to
victory
under
the
leadership
of
AndrÃ©as
PapandrÃ©ou
and
the
PASOK
party
PapandrÃ©ou
espoused
the
desires
of
post-war
generation
to
maintain
peace
and
stability
and
to
secure
better
future
for
their
children
By
1990
beleaguered
by
personal
and
financial
scandals
in
the
administration
PASOK
was
defeated
at
the
polls
after
three
rounds
of
voting
by
the
conservative
New
Democracy
Party;
Constantine
MitsotÃ¡kis
became
the
new
prime
minister
But
the
tenacious
PapandrÃ©ou
was
re-elected
in
1994
He
died
in
office
in
1996
and
was
succeeded
by
Prime
Minister
Simitos
who
still
holds
the
post
In
the
1990s
Athens
was
awarded
the
2004
Olympic
Games
This
and
Greeceâs
agreement
to
join
the
Euro
currency
zone
in
2002
has
resulted
in
great
deal
of
infrastructure
and
economic
development
which
has
not
been
without
its
problems
Traffic
in
the
city
is
still
in
gridlock
stadium
construction
is
behind
schedule
and
the
Greek
economy
has
yet
to
meet
the
requirements
for
monetary
union
but
government
rhetoric
is
upbeat
as
both
deadlines
approach
The
history
of
Athens
reflects
the
ingenuity
and
vigor
of
the
Greek
spirit
that
will
no
doubt
meet
whatever
challenges
the
modern
world
has
in
store
for
it

Markets
Amsterdam
still
has
good
number
of
authentic
street
markets
where
you
can
mix
with
local
people

Some
markets
cater
to
those
with
specialist

are
by
no
means
place

the
most
famous
market
in
Amsterdam
is
the
Bloemenmarkt

also
has
an
international
reputation
although
the
market
is
much
smaller
since
the
building
of
the
Muziek
Theater
Many
stall
holders
have
moved
to
other
locations
in
the
city

still
feature
heavily
along
with
ethnic
wear
It

are
dealers
in
almost
every
different
specialist
area
This
is
not
place
for
amateur
collectors;
prices
are
high
but
so
is
quality
the
expertise
of
the
dealers
and
the
advice
which
they
give
Many
of
the

Art
The
lure
of
the
city
for
creative
people
has
existed
for
centuries
and
modern
artists
follow
in
the
wake
of
Rembrandt
and
the
Dutch
masters
Dozens
of
small
galleries
offer
everything
from
classical
to
pop
art

at
the
major
galleries
also
promote
the
work
of
up
and
coming
younger
artists
as
well
as
established
names
Street

is
also
very
much
in

Diamonds
Before
WWII
Amsterdam
was
major
center
for
the
buying
and
polishing
of
diamonds
The
industry
was
decimated
by
the
loss
of
many
Jewish
families
who
ran
the
major
diamond
houses
but
slow
recovery
ensured
its
survival
Today
the
industry
is
known
for
the
quality
of
its
polishing
and
of
the
expertise
of
many
independent
traders
Five
main
diamond
houses
are
responsible
for
buying
and
polishing
stones
They
sell
to
smaller
dealers
but
also
sell
to
the
public
Youâll
be
able
to
see
diamond
polishers
at
work
before
you
buy
You
can
choose
from
loose
stones
or
finished
pieces
of

The
pottery
style
we
now
know
as
Delft
(after
the

to
the
southeast
of
Amsterdam)
was
produced
in
potteries
all
across
the
country
during
the
Golden
Age
There
was
famous
factory
in
Prinsengracht
in
the

some
cities
can
be
dull
for
children

many
attractions
and
activities
to
keep
younger
visitors
occupied
Take

this
is
the
normal
method
which
most
Amsterdammers
use
to
get
to
and
from

it
is
an
unusual
transportation
method
for
most
of
the
rest
of
us
Children

recreation
of

the
sense

What
to
Do
Shopping
What
to
Buy
Crafts
Bahamians
have
always
had
to
fend
for
themselves
and
this
resourcefulness
has
led
them
to
become
proficient
at
number
of
practical
handicrafts
many
of
which
make
beautiful
souvenirs
Straw
goods
are
the
most
ubiquitous
The
Seminole
Indians
of
Red
Bay
on
Andros
are
said
to
produce
the
finest
work
on
the
Bahamas
though
each
island
has
its
own
individual
patterns
and
differences
in
style
It
is
still
possible
to
watch
the
women
at
work
on
the
islands
of
Andros
and
at
George
Town
on
Exuma
Straw
work
can
be
bought
from
small
workshops
in
peopleâs
homes
or
from
the
better
quality
straw
vendors
in
Nassau
Prices
can
be
high
but
even
small
bowls
make
beautiful
and
practical
reminders
of
your
trip
The
handmade
pieces
are
likely
to
become
rare
within
couple
of
generations
because
so
few
young
Bahamian
women
are
now
taking
up
the
craft
Be
aware
that
much
of
the
straw
work
particularly
the
mass-market
goods
like
hats
and
bags
is
not
made
in
the
Bahamas
but
in
Taiwan
and
China
If
you
want
to
be
sure
of
getting
genuine
Bahamian
straw
work
buy
from
places
such
as
The
Plait
Lady
who
has
shop
on
Bay
Street
in
Nassau;
youâll
have
to
pay
little
more
but
youâll
be
sure
youâre
getting
an
authentic
handmade
work
of
art
Paintings
and
art
work
with
scenes
of
everyday
life
also
make
beautiful
mementos
The
work
of
number
of
artists
including
Alton
Lowe
and
Eddie
Minnis
is
becoming
very
collectable
and
prices
can
be
high
On
the
other
end
of
the
scale
street
art
including
things
like
driftwood
paintings
can
be
fun
and
much
more
affordable
Wood
carvings
are
made
from
variety
of
native
trees
Some
of
the
best
are
made
from
the
lignum
vitae
the
Bahamian
national
tree
and
from
the
wild
tamarind
The
carvings
come
in
bewildering
variety
though
animal
and
fish
motifs
seem
to
predominate
Always
check
piece
thoroughly
before
you
buy
as
they
are
vary
in
quality
Donât
buy
wood
if
it
looks
greenÂ âÂ this
usually
means
the
wood
has
not
been
allowed
to
season
and
it
may
split
as
it
dries
Seashells
and
sponges
can
be
found
in
every
market
and
souvenir
shop
in
the
Bahamas
They
make
beautiful
natural
souvenirs
but
some
may
come
from
protected
species
Do
not
buy
coral
or
turtle
products
as
this
is
illegal
and
only
encourages
further
damage
to
these
delicate
and
rare
forms
of
sea
life

an
empty

shops
will
make
claims
that
they
save
you
30â40
percent
on
prices
youâd
pay
back
home
but
this
is
not
universally
true
and
itâs
always
important
to
so
some
research
on
prices
in
your
hometown
before
you
go
Some
goods
are

Youâll
also
find
diving

opportunities
on
the
main
islands
of
New

And
there
are
special
places
around
the
Out
Islands
that
offer
exceptional
experiences
though
not
much
lively
entertainment
out
of

Here
is
list
of
particularly
exciting
sites:
New
Providence
Thunderball
and
Canonball
reefs
Just
off
the
coast
of
Rose
Island
and
named
for
the
James
Bond
films
that
were
filmed
here;
the
coral
formations
are
impressive
and
large
fish
such
as
grouper
are
numerous
Grand

Moray

and
thousands
of
angel
fish
now
live
among
the
coral

Andros
The
barrier
reef
here
is
the
third
longest
in
the
world
At
60
ft
(20
m)
below
the
surface
it
is
for
divers
only
though
snorkelers
can
splash
around
in
the
shallow
coastal
areas
which
are
also
rich
in
sea
life
Spectacular
large
fish
and
sharks
are
usually
sighted
here
at
the
âTongue
of
the
Ocean,â
which
in
some
places
lies
only
120
ft
(40
m)
offshore
but
drops
an
amazing
6000
ft
(2000
m)
to
the
ocean
trench
There
are
also
several
âblue

this

more

and
the
Bahamas
also
happen
to
be
on
the
migration
routes
of
many
species
This
all
adds
up
to
make
the
Bahamas
one
of
the
worldâs
greatest
territories
for
game
fishing
The
Commonwealth
currently
holds
world
records
for
several
species
of

Sport
fishingÂ âÂ that
is
catching

hugely
popular
and

fishing
boats
by
the

full
day
or

on
almost
every
one
of
the
main
islands
The
local
guides
are
especially
experienced
and
helpful
The
Bimini
Islands
have
been
the
capital
of
sport
fishing
for
decades;
here
youâll
find
hundreds
of
huge
boats
lining
the
marinas
waiting
to
be
taken
out
into
the
teeming
waters
(Ernest
Hemingway
led
the
way
here.)
Bonefishing
is
also
big
business
around
the
islands
Large
strong
inedible
fish
that
frequent
the
shallows
and
sand
flats
bonefish
are
said
to
be
the
most
difficult
species
in
the
world
to
catch
Andros
has
long
claimed
to
be
the
âbonefishing
capital
of
the
world,â
but
other
Bahamian
islands
are
vying
for
its
crown
Bimini
offers
exciting
opportunities
and
the

water
for
anglersÂ âÂ the

are
still
unaware
of

Sailing
With
hundreds
of
unpopulated
islands
and
dozens
of
empty
beaches
surrounded
by
dozens
of
shallow
channels
and
sounds
the
Bahamas
are
paradise
for
sailors
Safe
harbors
with
superb
facilities
cozy
coves
for
night
alone
and
the
possibility
of
making
short
hops
to
different
port
every
night
allow
sailors
to
experience
all
the
different
atmospheres
of
the
various
islands
On
many
of
the
islands
renting
boat
is
as
easy
as
renting
car
is
in
other
destinationsÂ âÂ especially
on
the
more
populated
Out
Islands
Rentals
can
vary
from
small
runabouts
that
will
get
you
around
the
harbor
and
the
coastal
shallows
to
large
sailing
yachts
and
motor
launches
for
inter-island
expeditions
Rates
vary
enormously

make
more
of
stay
in
the
Abacos
or
Exumas
where
there
are
many
outlaying
cays

your
own
boat
you
can
take
advantage
of
the
services
of
local
guide
to
take
you
to
fishing
snorkeling
or
dive
sites
The
Abacos
are
most
popular
spot
for
sailing
primarily
because
of
the
many
sheltered
harbors
and
the
many
islands
and
cays
that
you
can
reach
without
having
to
go
outside
of
the
reefs
and
into
ocean
waters
If
you
want
to
get
out
and
see
lot
of
boats
without
doing
any
sailing
head
to
the
Bahamas
during
the
Regattas
when
boats
crowd
the
harbors
and
the
little
towns
are
full
of
yachtsmen
Listen
to
the
stories
of

deeds
in

Flying
For
qualified
pilots
the
Bahamas
offers
one
of
the
ultimate
flying
experiences
There
are
numerous
small
airfields
on
the
outlying
islands
and
flying
between
the
islands
is
relatively
safe
with
short
transfers
Looking
down
at
the
shallow

ocean
trenches
is
perhaps
the
only
way
to

the
beauty
of
the

Entertainment
Traditional
Music
Puppetry
and
DanceÂ Performances
The
sound
of
music
in
Bali
can
be
the
hypnotic
tones
of
the
gamelan
orchestra
or
the
alluring
call
of
the
disco
beat
at
Kuta
or
Legian
where
the
action
begins
at
midnight
and
lasts
until
dawn
In
the
rest
of
the
resorts
the
nightlife
is
on
much
smaller
scale
Baliâs
own
celebrated
culture
of
dance
and
drama
flourishes
on
two
levels:
for
the
visitors
and
for
locals
themselves
Ask
at
hotels
travel
agencies
and
tourist
information
offices
to
find
out
what
is
scheduled
during
your
stay
Theyâll
probably
point
you
towards
some
of
the
commercial
performances
put
on
in
several
villages
mostly
in
the
Ubud
area
Tickets
(including
transport)
are
sold
at
the
tourist
office
in
Ubud
and
by
many
of
the
tour
operators
Increasingly
the
culture
is
packaged
and
brought
to
you
in
shows
staged
at
hotels
Some
of
these
are
of
very
high
standard:
Dedicated
dancers
and
musicians
usually
do
give
their
best
But
inevitably
the
atmosphere
is
different
when
they
are
performing
for
untutored
tourists
eating
dinner
rather
than
for
an
expert
village
audienceÂ âÂ and
above
all
for
their
gods
Drama
and
dance
students
will
think
that
theyâve
gone
to
heaven
when
they
see
the
unique
temple
ceremonies
If
you
are
invited
be
prepared
to
wait
for
long
time
Starting
times
are
highly
elastic
and
then
some
events
will
last
for
many
hours
Many
of
the
dances
of
Bali
are
also
performed
in
western
Lombok
either
for
the
Balinese
community
there
or
increasingly
for
the
tourists
at
Senggigi
hotels
Lombok
also
has
its
own
special
dances
which
are
rarely
staged
commercially
Some
are
for
men
onlyÂ âÂ one
simulating
battle
preparations
probably
derives
from
the
Islamic
tradition
The
gandrung
dance
closely
resembles
Baliâs
joged
in
that
girl
picks
male
partner
from
the
audience
Another
group
of
dances
is
based
on
romantic
legends
from
Sasak
mythology
dating
back
to
before
the
advent
of
Islam
Western-style
nightlife
is
limited
to
Senggigi
where
some
hotels
run
discos
and
local
groups
play
in
the
bar-restaurants
The
puppet
shadow
plays
called
wayang
kulit
(leather
puppet)
are
not
so
often
put
on
for
touristsÂ âÂ the
plots
are
too
complex
and
the
plays
last
too
long
(up
to
two
days)
for
foreign
consumption
temple
ceremony
may
give
you
chance
to
join
the
audience
for
while
You
may
look
behind
the
screenÂ âÂ itâs
permittedÂ âÂ to
see
the
dalang
or
puppet
master
expertly
controlling
the
beautiful
figures
speaking
all
of
their
lines
in
vast
range
of
appropriate
voices
while
conducting
the
small
orchestra
Dances
of
Bali
Legong:
This
is
the
visitorsâ
favorite
dance
performed
by
three
young
girls:
two
principal
dancers
the
legongs
no
more
than
12
or
13
years
old
and
an
attendant
Each
is
exquisitely
dressed
in
glittering
songket
fabrics
and
wears
gilded
and
jeweled
head-dress
embellished
with
fresh
frangipani
(plumeria)
flowers
The
usual
version
(legong
kraton)
is
the
tale
of
king
and
the
princess
he
has
abducted
performed
by
the
two
principals
who
using
various
hand
and
facial
gestures
portray
the
attempted
seduction
Kecak:
Part
of
much
longer
ritual
trance-dance
which
is
called
sanghyang
this
is
mostly
performed
separately
Up
to
150
men
in
sarongs
crouch
in
concentric
circles
around
flickering
lamp
and
chant
hypnotically
while
the
story
is
acted
out
in
the
center
of
the
circle
Taken
from
the
Ramayana
the
dance
concerns
Rama
and
Sita
and
the
monkey
armies
of
Hanuman
and
Sugriwa
hence
the
kecakâs
popular
title
of
âMonkey
Dance.â
The
dance
as
performed
today
was
choreographed
by
the
German
artist
Walter
Spies
who
did
so
much
to
influence
art
in
the
Ubud
region
during
the
1930s
Pendet:
Six
or
more
girls
carrying
trays
of
flower
petals
open
the
evening
by
scattering
the
petals
over
the
stage
as
symbol
of
welcome
At
the
same
time
man
may
light
an
incense-burning
lamp
At
temple
ceremonies
the
pendet
is
danced
to
welcome
the
gods
Janger:
Twelve
boys
and
twelve
girls
in
groups
of
six
form
square
the
girls
kneeling
and
swaying
together
to
the
music
like
reeds
in
the
wind
The
boys
wearing
false
moustaches
try
to
impress
the
girls
as
they
strut
and
preen
like
fighting
roosters
Joged:
whole
family
of
dances
shares
this
name
performed
to
the
music
of
an
orchestra
of
bamboo
xylophones
and
gongs
But
one
properly
called
the
jegog
has
become
so
popular
that
it
alone
is
often
considered
to
be
joged
young
woman
dances
alone
at
first
and
then
taps
members
of
the
audience
in
turn
to
dance
with
her
Try
as
they
may
to
flirt
or
show
off
she
easily
slips
away
from
their
advances
Few
Westerners
look
anything
but
clumsy
in
comparison
Barong:
mythical
lion-like
animal
the
barong
is
covered
in
long
hair
and
little
mirrors
Animated
by
two
men
it
fights
against
the
evil
Rangda
queen
of
the
witches
Her
long
claw-like
fingernails
hold
white
cloth
to
hide
her
terrible
face
bulging
eyes
fangs
and
flaming
tongue
while
she
advances
on
her
victims
Allies
of
the
barong
men
wearing
sarongs
and
each
carrying
kris
try
to
attack
Rangda
but
she
puts
them
under
spell
In
trance
they
turn
the
knives
on
themselves
Only
the
reappearance
of
the
barong
saves
them
In
daily
performances
for
visitors
(each
morning
at
Batubulan
for
instance)
the
trances
are
inevitably
simulated
Late
at
night
in
village
however
you
would
see
the
wild-eyed
men
in
genuine
frenzy
or
collapsing
at
the
climax
into
unconsciousness
until
revived
by
priests
who
sprinkle
them
with
holy
water
Other
Dances:
Other
performances
you
might
see
include
scenes
from
the
Hindu
epic
drama
the
Ramayana
staged
as
ballet
These
may
well
be
showcase
for
fine
dancing
gorgeous
costumes
and
the
full
range
of
the
gamelan
orchestra
In
the
topeng
the
dancers
are
masked
meaning
that
they
can
convey
character
and
emotion
through
movement
alone
The
stories
are
taken
from
Balinese
history
and
mythology
Kebyar
is
the
name
of
group
of
solo
dances
of
which
the
best
known
are
performed
by
seated
man
using
only
the
upper
body
Baris
is
vehicle
for
groups
of
young
male
dancers
to
display
their
command
of
technique
conveying
great
range
of
emotions
Festivals
and
Events
Most
festivals
are
fixed
by
calendars
different
from
the
Western
version
(see
page
91)
so
they
change
each
year
Look
for
the
Indonesian
Directorate
of
Tourismâs
annual
Calendar
of
Events
which
is
published
in
Bali
and
gives
dates
and
locations
of
temple
festivals
Two
celebrations
stick
to
fixed
dates:
The
Walter
Spies
festival
in
February
and
the
summer
Arts
Festival
with
superb
performances
which
is
held
in
Denpasar
in
late
June
and
early
July
Shopping
Bali
produces
wide
range
and
large
quantity
of
crafts
in
every
medium
Most
of
the
decorative
arts
and
crafts
originally
had
religious
connection
as
temple
embellishments
offerings
or
ceremonial
dress
The
land
yielded
plenty
to
eat
without
the
need
to
work
all
day
every
day
so
people
had
time
to
create
objects
of
beauty
The
tradition
continues
although
production
has
been
multiplied
by
the
demand
for
souvenirs
Some
craft
shops
in
the
villages
have
workshops
attached
or
you
can
watch
the
carvers
painters
or
weavers
in
the
adjoining
compound
In
the
past
nothing
was
expected
to
last:
The
climate
and
insects

that

anything
is
very

game

Wood
carvings:
Dozens
of
villages
devote
themselves
to
Baliâs
biggest
craft
business;
Mas
(see
page
41)
is
the
best-known
with
hundreds
of
carvers
and
countless
shops
Behind
the
scenesÂ âÂ but
you
may
be
invited
for
visitÂ âÂ fathers
pass
on
their
skills
to
their
sons
while
the
women
do
the
polishing
or
painting
The
best
carvings
are
superb
sculptures
but
even
the
simplest
cheapest
article
can
make
an
appealing
souvenir
Among
the
massed
garuda
birds
and
masks
youâre
bound
to
find
something
beautiful
The
sign
âParasite
Carvingsâ
might
puzzle
you
new
idea
imported
from
the
West
is
to
take
the
galls
and
other
strange
growths
that
occur
on
tree
trunks
and
carve
them
into
witty
or
grotesque
design
using
the
natural
shape
Jewelry:
The
village
of
Celuk
(see
page
40)
specialized
in
producing
silver
and
gold
jewelry
for
centuries
so
when
tourism
arrived
its
position
on
the
Denpasar-Ubud
road
was
ideal
Dozens
of
tour
buses
stop
at
the
big
shops
but
there
are
many
little
workshops
worth
visiting
too
The
smiths
can
produce
any
style:
from
intricate
filigree
work
to
simple
bracelets
You
donât
have
to
go
to
Celuk
though
since
every
resort
area
has
its
share
of
shops
Silver
should
bear
the
â925â
stamp
of
sterling
silver
(meaning
itâs
92.5%
pure)
Clothes
and
Fabrics:
Bali
is
huge
bargain
basement
for
selection
of
beachwear
casual
clothing
and
at
higher
price
but
still
excellent
value
fashion
designs
For
the
biggest
choice
of
shops
go
to
Kuta
and
look
for
dresses
shirts
sarongs
and
cover-ups
in
traditional
batik
fabric
Batik
dyeing
technique
uses
hot
wax
to
draw
or
stamp
design
on
cloth
before
dipping
it
in
the
dye
so
that
the
waxed
areas
are
left
undyed
The
process
can
be
repeated
number
of
times
for
greater
complexity
Java
is
the
source
of
the
batik
for
dresses
and
sarongs
sold
in
fashion
shops;
Balinese
versions
are
usually
much
coarser
Hawkers
will
swear
that
their
dress
lengths
of
cheap
printed
cotton
are
batik
Itâs
easy
to
tell
that
they
are
not:
Printed
patterns
donât
penetrate
fully
to
the
other
side
while
the
real
batik
will
show
thin
veins
of
color
where
the
dye
runs
along
tiny
cracks
in
the
wax
(printed
versions
may
try
to
simulate
this)
Real
batik
is
always
much
more
expensive
Used
batik
sarongs
are
highly
prized
as
their
patterns
are
often
no
longer
produced
Used
batik
can
be
bought
for
very
low
fixed
prices
at
textile
shops
like
Alec
on
Jalan
Legian
in
Kuta-Legian
Endek
or
ikat
fabrics
using
threads
dyed
in
patterns
before
weaving
come
from
Gianyar
in
Bali
as
well
as
other
Indonesian
islands
In
Bali
only
the
weavers
of
Tenganan
make
grinsing
or
double
ikat
using
pattern-dyed
threads
for
both
warp
and
weft
The
genuine
fabric
is
justifiably
expensiveÂ âÂ beware
of
fakes!
You
can
find
bold
primitive
examples
of
ikat
cloth
especially
from
islands
such
as
Sumba
Flores
and
Timor
in
good
textile
shops
Paintings:
If
you
want
unique
work
of
art
youâll
need
to
study
the
field
Visit
the
major
collections
to
judge
the
standard
of
the
best
paintings
especially
the
Neka
Museum
and
Museum
Puri
Lukisan
in
Ubud
(see

as
well
as
the
Arts
Centre
in
Denpasar
(see

Walking

Hiking
This
is
an
ideal

to
put
on
your

and
take

the
countryside
You
will
be
well-rewarded
with
small
remote
villages
hidden
churches
and
rural
lifestyle
to

Though
Cretans
are
bemused
as
to
why
anyone
would
want
to
hike
without
any
purpose
but
the
pleasure
of
it
they
have
genuine
welcome
for
travelers
on

Itineraries
can
range
from
easy
flat
short
walks
to
steep
mountain
hikes
though
itâs
not
advisable
to
head
into
the
high

Gorge
walks
are
particularly
popular;
the
SamariÃ¡
is
the
busiest
and
the
longest
Other
gorge
walks
include
Imbros
near
SamariÃ¡
and
the
Valley
of
the
Dead
at
ZÃ¡kros
on
the
eastern

present
dramatic

AkrotÃ­ri
is
the
most
populated
though
not
as
rugged
as
GramvoÃºssa
and
RodÃ³pou
which
are

Biking
Many

as
well
as

and
mountain

and
bike

are
becoming
more
popular
Once
into
the
hinterland
however
you
will
need
some
stamina
to
make
it
up
the
hills
and
mountain
passes
Diexodos
also
organizes
bike
tours
(see

Diving
and
Snorkeling
The
waters
around
the
island
offer
some
interesting
diving
and
snorkeling
opportunities
for
water
lovers
with
all
levels
of
underwater
experience
Although
the
Mediterranean
Sea
is
rather
overfished
and
the
waters
are
not
warm
enough
to
support
brightly
colored
tropical
fish
there
are
still
numerous
varieties
to
spot
in
the
rocky
shallows
including
octopi
that
make
their
homes
in
tiny
crevices
The
remains
of
many
ancient
sites
lie
just
off
the
coastline
At
EloÃºnda
you
can
explore
the
remains
of
Ãlous
and
MÃ¡tala
has
port
and
harbor
pier
The
Greek
government
is
concerned
that
archaeological
treasures
do
not
disappear
and
for
this
reason
diving
is
only
allowed
with
qualified
dive
company
that
will
oversee
underwater
locations
and
activities
If
you
have
never
scuba-dived
before
each
dive
center
is
registered
by
the
Greek
government
to
offer
training
in
addition
to
dive
supervision
for
qualified
divers
All
centers
are
affiliated
with
one
of
the
major
certifying
bodies;
PADI
(Professional
Association
of
Diving
Instructors)
is
the
most
common
The
basic
qualification
the
Open
Water
certificate
takes
five
days
to
complete
Many
centers
also
offer
an
introductory
session
commonly
known
as
the
âDiscover
SCUBA
Program.â
This
involves
morning
or
afternoon
of
theory
and
shallow
water
work
giving
you
the
chance
to
try
out
the
basic
techniques
before
you
decide
to
do
the
full
open
water
course
Entertainment
huge
number
of
fairs
and

take

Crete
Each
community
celebrates
its

Saintâs

or
panagiraie
when
the

is
paraded
through
the
streets
After
solemn
religious
service
the
rest
of
the
day
is
given
over
to

These
are
the
best
places
to
see
traditional
Cretan
dances
and
live
music
and
join
in
with
local
people
having
some
fun
Each

has
one
at
some

to
be
an
opportunity

Zorba
the
Greek?
Music
and
Dance
For
many
the
image
of
Greek
music
and
dance
is
inexorably
linked
to
the
film
âZorba
the
Greek.â
Anthony
Quinn
performs
the
syrtÃ¡ki
dance
(in
fact
an
amalgam
of
several
different
traditional
dances)
to
the
sound
of
the
bouzoÃºki
stringed
guitar-type
instrument
that
produces
melodic
slightly
metallic
sounds
When
played
live
it
has
haunting
melody
but
taverna
owners
do
have
the
irritating
habit
of
playing
it
at
high
decibels
through
overloaded
speakers
This
does
great
disservice
to
the
Greek
musical
tradition
which
is
rich
varied
and
goes
back
for
hundreds
of
years
The
tradition
is
still
particularly
strong
on
Crete
where
traditional
musicians
and
singers
are
held
in
high
regard
Musical
rhythms
were
traditionally
matched
to
the
complex
cadences
of
the
epic
poetry
of
Greece
These
are
very
different
from
the
âfour
beats
to
barâ
that
characterizes
the
western
musical
tradition
and
therefore
it
is
sometimes
difficult
for
Western
listeners
to
follow
Songs
have
traditionally
been
sung
by
menââârelating
the
hard
life
of
the
farmer
or
fisherman
and
including
an
element
of
sentimentality
rarely
expressed
in
other
areas
of
Greek
maleâs
life
Each
region
of
Greece
has
its
own
particular
songs
and
dances
The
music
of
the
southern
islands
is
called
nisiotika
while
in
the
northern
Aegean
there
is
style
called
sandouri
Most
regions
also
have
syrtos
dance
steps
performed
in
the
round
Creteâs
main
traditional
musical
instrument
is
the
lyra
U-shaped
stringed
instrument
This
is
usually
accompanied
by
the
laouto
variation
of
the
mandolin;
the
askomantoura
Cretan
bagpipes;
and
the
habioli
the
shepherdâs
flute
The
instruments
are
brought
together
in
mantinada
songs
with
rhyming
couplets
of
lyrics
Many
of
these
have
been
passed
down
through
generations
of
Cretans
The
fighters
of
the
western
mountains
had
their
own
songs
the
rizitika
with
lyrics
praising
bravery
and
patriotism
The
mountain
men
also
have
their
own
dances
The
steps
of
the
tsamÃ­ko
are
slow
and
grand
reinforcing
the
status
of
these
heroic
figures
RÃ©thymnon
has
its
own
dance
the
soÃºsta
with
hopping
steps
You
can
also
try
the
pendozalis
Chanting
epic
poetry
is
also
Cretan
tradition
that
has
been
carried
through
the
generations
This
would
have
strengthened
the
bonds
of
lonely
and
frightened
young
fighters
and
stirred
their
blood
before
action
The
17th-century
ErotÃ³kritos
written
by
VinzÃ©tzos
KornÃ¡ros
is
the
most
popular
of
these
RÃ©thymnon
holds
number
of
festivals
throughout
the
summer
with
the
municipal
gardens
and
fortress
the
usual
venues
The
July
Music
Festival
is
followed
by
the
Renaissance
Festival
in
August
This
includes
numerous
classical
performances
The
larger
hotels
will
usually
hold
âGreekâ
evening
on
one
night
each
week
The
music
and
dance
is
usually
of
high
standard
though
the
surroundings
can
be
less
than
authentic
The
settlement
of
Ano
HersÃ³nissos
just
inland
from
the
resort
holds
weekly
Greek
evening
in
the
village
square
Itâs
full
of
atmosphere
and
there
is
selection
of
tavernas
where
you
can
enjoy
meal
while
watching
the
show
Dionysos
Restaurant
at
Limnes
near
Ãgios
NikÃ³laos
also
holds
music
and
dance
evenings
Shopping
Shopping
is
one
of
the
delights
of
trip
to
Crete
and
souvenirs
abound
in
all
ranges
of
price
and
quality
Many
souvenir
shops
in
the
major
resorts
tend
to
cater
to
the
popular;
however
you
donât
need
to
look
far
to
find
locally
produced
goods
that
make
wonderful
remembrances
of
your
trip
and
the
narrow
streets
of
the
old
towns
are
the
perfect
places
to
browse
for
hours
Prices
can
be
flexible
particularly
in
tourist
shops
and
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
season
so
donât
seem
too
eager
to
pay
the
ticket
price
Textiles
Wool
and
goat
hair
have
always
been
used
to
produce
material
clothing
and
interesting
rugs
carpets
and
throws
You
can
still
buy
handmade
piecesâââhyfanda
âââwith
traditional
designs
or
machine-produced
items
Brighter
colors
often
indicate
synthetic
dyes
whereas
traditionally-made
items
are
still
made
with
the
muted
earthy
colors
of
natural
dyes
The
price
differential
will
also
indicate
the
difference
between
the
two
Dolphins
and
fish
are
popular
themes
as
are
stylized
images
of
Greek
gods
Youâll
find
particularly
interesting
ranges
in
KritsÃ¡
and
AnÃ³gia
along
with
the
approach
to
the
Dictaean
Cave
in
LasÃ­thi
and
in
shops
in
ChaniÃ¡
If
rugged
textiles
donât
appeal
then
youâll
also
find
beautiful
embroidered
items
such
as
cotton
and
linen
tablecloths
and
napkins
Again
the
hand-embroidered
pieces
are
the
best
and
the
most
expensive
but
this
skill
is
dying
art
so
good
examples
will
become
harder
to
find
You
will
however
have
plenty
of
everyday
tablecloths
to
choose
from
in
markets

are
still
sold
in
the

of
RÃ©thymnon
and
ChaniÃ¡
There
is
also

at
KritsÃ¡
but
these

modern
mass-produced

seem
to
be
invading
the

Hopefully
this
wonât
signal
the
demise
of

can
also

boots
âââalmost

They

and
judging
by
the
number

well-worn

it
certainly

obvious
choices

The

Art
and
Icons
Artists
flocked
to
ChaniÃ¡
in
the
1960s
and
70s
and
this
has
left
legacy
in
the
quality
of
work
on
sale
here
(and
to
lesser
extent
throughout
Crete)
You
will
find
number
of
galleries
displaying
work
by
local
and
international
artists
in
the
narrow
alleyways
of
the
ÃvrÃ©ika
Quarter
more
Greek
form
of
art
is
that
of
the
icon
An
icon
is
religious
portrait
usually
of
saint
or
apostle
These
were
development
from
the
fayum
paintings
that
covered
the
face
of
the
dead
in
the
sarcophagi
of
Egyptian
mummies
Icons
lie
at
the
heart
of
Byzantine
or
Orthodox
worship
and
they
form
focus
for
prayer
The
characteristic
gold
leaf
used
in
their
production
symbolized
the
glory
of
God
For
centuries
they
were
popular
souvenirs
of
the
grand
European
Tour
or
religious
pilgrimage
However
modern
production
methods
including
thin
artificial
canvas
and
gaudy
synthetic
colors
saw
them
lose
favor
In
recent
years
there
has
been
rebirth
in
icon
painting
using
traditional
methods
both
for
church
renovations
and
for
commercial
sale
This
time-consuming
work
is
exquisite
and
correspondingly
expensive
Most
monasteries
on
Crete
create
certified
copies
of
their
most
celebrated
icons
and
you
can
also
find
them
in
jewelry
shops
and
specialty
stores
in
the
towns
Jewelry
Both
gold
and
silver
are
sold
by
weight
with
relatively
little
extra
cost
for
workmanship
so
they
represent
good
value
Ancient
Minoan
patterns
are
common
with
necklaces
bracelets
and
rings
in
matching
sets
You
can
also
find
precious
and
semi-precious
set-stone
items
However
you
donât
need
large
budget
to
buy
trinkets
as
there
is
plethora
of
popular

jewelry
for
sale
with
leather
semi-precious
stones

Pottery
and
Ceramics
Itâs
not
surprising
given
the
importance
of
ceramics
and
pottery
throughout
Creteâs
history
that
it
is
still
significant
industry
Pieces
come
as
small
as
ring
holder
or
olive
bowl
to
huge
garden
pieces
that
would
have
to
be
shipped
back
home
Both
unglazed
and
ceramic
styles
are
available;
most
notable
of
these
is
the
bright
blue
glaze
of
ChaniÃ¡
ceramics
Traditional
designs
abound
including
marine
themes
Minoan
designs
and
Classical
Greek
imagery
Modern
free-form
pieces
can
also
be
found
particularly
in
ChaniÃ¡
where
there
are

visit
to
Crete
isnât
all
about
museums
and
ancient
sites
Thereâs
lots
of
fun
to
be
had
for
younger
members
of
the
family
Greek

is
very
family-oriented
and
children
will
be
very
welcome
at
tavernas
and
cafÃ©s
Beach
activities
are
well-organized
on
the
northern
coast
with

is
adequately
protectedâeven
when

and
MÃ¡lia
will
keep
them
busy
and
wet
for
hours
horse
and
carriage
ride
through
the
streets
of
ChaniÃ¡
is
great
treat
and
gives
young
children
good
vantage
point
They
can
even
sit
next
to
the
driver
At
Greek
evenings
hotels
usually
allow
kids
to
get
up
on
the
dance
floor
and
try
the
steps
themselves
Trips
along
the
coast
in
colorful
caÃ¯ques
offer
the
chance
to
enjoy
cooling
breeze
and
an
alternative
view
of

in
IrÃ¡klion
and
FrangokÃ¡stello
allow
imaginations
to
run
wildâââ

will
believe
heâs
Errol
Flynn
and
the
children
might
choose
to
be
Hercules
or
Xena
Shopping
is
so
varied
that
even
the
most
meager
allowance
funds
spending
spree
The

rural
lifestyle
of
the
interior
will
delight
urban-dwelling
childrenâââwatching
the

herds
filing
past
the
car
or
the
donkeys
working
hard
for
their
owners

cats
and
playful
kittens
abound
and
sea

and
geese
can
be
found
at
many
coastal
fishing
villages

you
want
to
spend
some
time
independently
of
your
children

large
hotels
have

clubsâ
where
the
days

air
of
the
evening
there
are

What
to
Buy
Handicrafts
The
Mayan
people
have
always
made
everything
they
needed
and
their
handicrafts
though
often
practical
make
beautiful
souvenirs
Basketware
made
from
sisal
and
other
plant
species
found
in
the
area
is
typically
used
to
carry
range
of
goods;
woven
mats
can
also
be
found
Hammocks
come
in
bewildering
range
of
quality
colors
and
sizes;
youâll
have
your
choice
of
sencillo
(single)
or
one
to
share
with
friends
such
as
dobleÂ (double)
or
matrimonial
(family-sized)
Weaving
has
also
been
very
important
skill
for
the
Mayans
The
fabric
produced
on
personal
looms
in
traditional
patterns
and
colors
is
used
in
variety
of
different
products
Sarapes
cotton
or
wool
blankets
and
rugs
are
popular
but
you
will
also
find
the
material
made
into
jackets
and
hats
Mayan
themes
The
Maya
have
special
place
in
the
imaginationÂ âÂ perhaps
only
surpassed
by
the
ancient
EgyptiansÂ âÂ and
their
traditional
motifs
and
copies
of
their
ceremonial
artifacts
make
popular
souvenirs
Carvings
of
the
gods
Chaac
Mool
in
particular
along
with
revered
creatures
such
as
the
jaguar
or
the
feathered
serpent
are
produced
in
stone
onyx
silver
wood
and
papier-mÃ¢chÃ©
in
various
sizes
from
lucky
talisman
for
your
purse
to
sculpture
for
your
garden
Ceremonial
masks
are
also
very
beautiful
and
can
be
found
in
range
of
qualities
and
sizes
Made
from
papier-mÃ¢chÃ©
that
is
smoothed
and
brightly
painted
they
make
beautiful
wall
decorations
Pottery
and
glassware
Terracotta
pots
have
been
the
basic
cooking
utensil
for
generations
of
Mayan
families
Youâll
find
these
in
various
sizes
and
with
different
decoration
Blown
glassware
is
also
exquisite;
bowls
jugs
and
vases
and
glasses
can
be
bought
throughout
the
region
Silver
Mexico
is
still
one
of
the
largest
producers
of
silver
in
the
world
despite
the
Spanish
conquistadors
having
looted
tons
of
it
during
their
years
of
conquest
There
is
an
amazing
range
of
jewelry
available
such
as
chains
earrings
and
finger
and
toe
rings
and
prices
are
extremely
competitive
Larger
pieces
such
as
tea-sets
and
goblets
can
be
found
in
the
bigger
stores
as
can
silver
pill-boxes
purses
or
small
âsombreros.â
Always
make
sure
that
your
purchase
bears
stamp
of
the
word
Mexico
and
of
the
numbers
925
(the
standard
quality
of
silver
found
here)
or
960
(purer
but
slightly
softer)
This
ensures
that
you
are
buying
genuine
silver
and
not
cheap
alloy
Tequila
and
other
alcohol
Tequila
is
the
national
drink
of
Mexico
made
from
the
distilled
juice
of
the
agave
plant
(100%
agave
tequila
is
the
best
quality)
and
it
can
be
bought
under
numerous
trade
names
It
is
produced
only
in
very
small
region
of
Mexico
around
the
town
of
Tequila
near
Guadalajara
and
is
in
reality
refined
version
of
the
agave
drink
Mezcal
You
can
also
take
home
bottle
of
the
Yucatecan
liquor
Xtebentun
with
its
flavor
of
anise
honey
and
flowers

that
are
ideal
for
the
warm
climate
here
Locally
produced
cottons
and
woven
garments
are
sold
in
craft-markets
and
stores
The
colorful
patterns
have
been
handed
down
through
the
generations
In
the
countryside
the
Mayan
women
still
wear
the
traditional
huipile
loose
cotton
slip
with
embroidered
detail;
the
everyday
version
has
stitching
around
the
neckline
and
hem
the
ceremonial
version
several
layers
of
embroidery
and
lace
In
MÃ©rida
the
men
wear
the
guayabera
short-sleeved
linen
or
cotton
shirt
with
finely
pleated
front
detail
worn
untucked
These
tend
to
be
much
cooler
than

with
sisal
thongs

off
your
whole
traditional
ensemble

people
wear
good
quality
panama
hats
(many
imported
from
Guatemala)

though
these
are
actually
traditional
in
regions
of
Mexico
other
than
YucatÃ¡n

Sports
Diving
CancÃºn
Cozumel
and
the
Maya
Riviera
offer
some
of
the
most
pristine
waters
for
diving
and
wealth
of
natural
reefs
and
artificial
dive
sites
to
explore
They
are
still
considered
some
of
the
best
sites
in
the
world
despite
the
explosion
in
the
number
of
divers
over
the
last
two
decades
The
lack
of
soil
and
rivers
on
the
Yucatecan
mainland
mean
that
there
is
no
silt
in
the
sea
to
reduce
underwater
visibility
and
there
is
little
heavy
industry
in
the
area
to
pollute
the
ocean
leaving
the
marine
life
relatively
healthy
The
island
of
Cozumel
is
still
regarded
as
the
jewel
among
diving
areas
There
are
30
km
(20
miles)
of
reef
at
many
different
depths
off
the
western
coast
Divers
have
chance
to
see
turtles
sharks
and
barracuda
in
their
natural
environment;
the
warm
waters
make
for
exciting
and
comfortable
diving
throughout
the
year
Plus
there
are
opportunities
for
both
certified
divers
and
those
who
would
like
to
earn
their
certification
CancÃºn
is
great
beginnerâs
resort;
it
has
many
shallow
dive
sites
suitable

tooÂ âÂ just
short
distance
from
your

dive
sites
and

anywhere
on

cenotes
sinkholes
found
in
the
sub-surface
limestone
layer
of
the
YucatÃ¡n
peninsula
caused
by
millions
of
years
of
erosion
The
Maya
considered
them
to
be
holy
places
because
they
were
the
only
source
of
fresh
water
other
than
what
fell
from
the
sky;
for
this
reason
Mayan
artifacts
have
been
found
in
many
cenotes
The
holes
provide
an
environment
for
turtles
eels
and

Swimming
in
the

water
of
the

the
climate
of
the
area
is
ideal
for

Pok-Ta-Pok
was
the
first
course
and
some
still
say
the
best
However
since
it
opened
several
large
hotels
have
built
courses
as
part
of
their
guest
facilities:
The

CancÃºn
km

The
Hilton
CancÃºn

and
The
Westin
Regina
km

There
are
several
courses
along
the
Maya
Riviera
principally
at
Puerto
Aventuras
and
Playacar
courses
are
located
in

Horseback
riding
The
Spanish
introduced
horses
to
the
region;
they
were
perfect
for
transport
through
the
âlow
jungle.â
Today
you
can
explore
the
area
on
horseback
enjoying
organized
and
guided
trails
at
many
parks
such
as
Xcaret
and
TrÃ©s
Rios
All
across
the
region
you
will
see
ranches
advertising
their
servicesÂ âÂ often
you
will
see
horse
tied
in
the
shade
at
the
ranch
entrance
to
indicate
that
riding
is
offered
Entertainment
Once
the
sun
goes
down
CancÃºn
gears
up
Thereâs
no
shortage
of
places
to
go
or
things
to
do
and
no
need
to
take
long
novel
to
fill
those
quiet
momentsÂ âÂ there
just
wonât
be
any
Many
people
donât
take
to
their
beds
until
theyâve
seen
the
sun
come
up
If
you
choose
to
stay
in
Mujeres
or
Cozumel
things
will
be
bit
more
laid
back
The
diving
fraternity
tends
to
enjoy
low-key
less
glamorous
entertainment
and
relatively
early
nights
before
they
head
under
the
waves
early
the
following
day
Before
you
head
straight
into
the
resort
atmosphere
of
CancÃºn
check
out
whatâs
happening
in
your
hotel
Many
have
âLas

floor
shows
Mexican
evenings
with
traditional
folk
music
and
dances
and
clubs
where
you
can
take
to
the
dance
floor
yourself
CancÃºn
is
developing
so
quickly
that
the
latest
hot-spots
change
constantly
Ask
your
concierge
where
the
place
to
be
is
or
just
follow
the
crowds
along
the
strip
Paseo
KukulkÃ¡n
in
downtown
CancÃºn
has
collection
of
bars
and
clubs
On
weekends
you
can
join
the
locals
in
the
Parque
de
Palapas
where
the
strains
of
rock
salsa
and
folk
music
can
blend
together
into
bewildering
cacophony
But
this
doesnât
prevent
everyone
from
having
great
funÂ âÂ and
the
atmosphere
is
definitely
infectious
Cozumel
has
number
of
music
bars
along
Avenida
Melgar
and
in
the
downtown
region
All
the
large

Fiestas
The
Spanish
colonists
carried
on
the
traditions
of
their
mother
country
and
to
this
day
there
are
yearly
fiestas
in
most
major
towns
Many
mark
Saintâs
days
or
founding
days
and
the
whole
population
will
dress
up
and
enjoy
lots
of
singing
and
dancing
Most
have
religious
procession
to
start
the
proceedings
The
major
fiestas
are
listed
in
the
Calendar
of

but
ask
the
tourist

office
about
whatâs
going
on
during
your
stay
The
city
of
MÃ©rida
seems
to
be
in
the
throes
of
constant
fiesta
hosting
live
cultural
shows
at
sites
around
the
downtown
area
Here
you
will
find
the
most
authentic
cultural
displays
in
the
region
The
program
changes
nightly
from
ballet
to
traditional
Yucatecan
folk
music
and

and
all
the
performances
are
free
There
are
special

powerful
here
Always
have
sun

light
when
Ticknor

Fields
the
publisher
of
Emerson
Longfellow

operated
here
from
1832
to

Here
on

December
1773
5,000
colonists
came
to
protest
the
tea
tax
They
listened
to
Samuel
Adams
and
then
marched
down
to
the

and
dumped
123,000
pounds
of
tea
into

itself
to
the
Old
State
House
(1713)
red-brick
building
with

cake
bell
tower
The
surrounding
buildings
dwarf
it
It
was
the
British
Governmentâs
headquarters
in
Boston
and
also
served
as
the
merchantsâ
exchange
and
after
the
revolution
as
the
state
capitol
Here
James
Otis
argued
against
the
Writs
of
Assistance;
the
Declaration
of
Independence
was
read
from
the
balcony
on
18
July
1776
The

Boston
Massacre
Here
on

1770
British
soldiers
taunted
by
colonists
fired
on
an
angry
crowd
killing
five
including
Crispus
Attucks
the
first
victim
who
was
black
The
massacre
aided
the
Revolutionary
cause
by
creating
its
first
martyrs
and
the
propagandists
including
Paul
Revere
who
made
an
engraving
of
the
event
used
it
to
their
advantage
The

malls
now
outshine
the
shopping
district
of
Downtown
Crossing
(around
the

but
here
youâll
discover
long-established

Itâs
hard
to
imagine
the
pedestrians-only
Washington

joining
the

before
the

to
well-heeled

for
over
century
Government
Center
and
Faneuil
Hall
This
is
Bostonâs
commercial
and
financial
heart
but
itâs
far
from
being
an
homogeneous
district:
It
incorporates
the
austere
Government
Center
and
the
lively
Faneuil
Hall
Marketplace
Government
Center
Little
good
can
be
said
about
Government
Center
Itâs
monolithic
dreary
and
soulless
The
city
has
attempted
to
enliven
the
complex
by
adding
garden
with
terraces
pools
and
niches
where
music
is
performed
but
thereâs
still
little
reason
to
visit
except
to
see
the
enormous
Steaming
Kettle
on
the
south
side
of
the
plaza
above
the
door
of
the
eponymous
coffee
shop
Commissioned
by
the
Oriental
Tea
Company
in
1873
it
is
an
appropriate
landmark
for
city
so
closely
linked
to
tea
Its
capacity
is
printed
on
its
side:
227
gallons
quarts

(some
868

Faneuil
Hall
Marketplace
Annually
14
million
visitors
come
to
Faneuil
Hall
the
great
âCradle
of
Libertyâ
and
marketplace
Itâs
very
commercial
but
very
alluring
and
one
of
the
most
successful
restorations
anywhere
Huguenot
merchant
Peter
Faneuil
(pronounced

burned
down
in

Here
on
the
second
floor
Bostonâs
great
orators
raised
their
voices
against
British
tyranny
against

most
legendary
feature
is
the
grasshopper

No

knows
really
why

it

who
come
to
feast
on

and
an

of
ethnic
cuisines
They
also
come
to
shop
at
the
stalls
the

and
the

to
watch
the

When

Older
Bostonians
can
still
recall
the
stench
of
rancid

emanating
from
them
on
hot
summerâs
day
and
the
gradual
decay
of
the

peer
in

lived
here
but
in

it
became
crowded

and
made
the

Charlestown
Across
the

the
Charlestown
Navy

has
played
major
role
in
Bostonâs
history
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
Today
itâs

or
the
U.S.S
Constitution
war
ship
that
was
built
in
1797
in
the
North
End
for
$302,718
During
her
naval
career
she
won
42
battles
captured
20
vessels
and
was
undefeated
Her
most
notable
triumphs
occurred
during
the
War
of
1812
when
she
vanquished
the
British
ships
Guerriere
Java
Cyane
and
Levant
British
sailor
gave
her
the

as
cannon
balls
skimmed
off
her
copper

and
he
marveled
at
her
apparent
indestructibility
Today
you

commemorates
the
first
battle
of
the

on
17
June
1775Â âÂ a
hollow
victory
for
the
British
who
suffered
more
than
1,000
casualties
against
400
to
600
for
the
colonials
Despite
the
name
it
actually
stands
on

Once
this
was
the
second
busiest
port
in
the
United
States
with
clippers
jostling
for
space
Today
after
long
period
of
decline
the
area
has
revived
and
the
granite
warehouses
have
been
renovated
into

the
New

the
tank
so
that
you
can
walk
around
the
whole
thing
More
than
70
exhibit
tanks
make
up
the
Aquarium
galleries
They
are
categorized
as
salt
or
fresh
water
and
feature
communities
of
fish
inhabiting
different
marine
climates
from
cold
and
temperate
to
tropical
Visitors
can
see
the
life

found
in

The
Childrenâs

is
both
vast
playground
and
stimulating
learning
center
The
buzz
words
here
are
âhands
onâ:
There
are
strange
sculptures
to
climb
over
bubbles
to
make
and
hopscotch
to
play
in
Chinese
and
Italian
in
the
Kidâs

reference
to
Bostonâs
multiculturalism
The

is
an
entire

On
fine
day
boat
trip
in
Boston
Harbor
is
idyllic
The
rectangular
circular
and
pyramidal
shapes
of
the
downtown
rooflines
are
etched
magnificently
against
the
skyline
The
water
is
bobbing
with
yachts
speedboats
tugs
and
fishing
craft
while
constant
stream
of
jets
descends
onto
the
waterside
runways
of
one
of
the
worldâs
busiest
airports
As
you
reach
the
outer
harbor
the
urban
scenery
fades
and
jumble
of
indecipherable
green
lumps
appear
These
are
the
30
tiny
islands
that
constitute
The
Harbor
Islands
Gulls
hover
over
lobster
pots
or
perch
on
rocky
outcrops;
channel
markers
float
on
the
surface
and
small
lighthouses
appear
on
the
horizon
Thereâs
not
that
much
to
do
or
see
on
the
seven
islands
that
make
up
Boston
Harbor
Islands
State
Park
but
an
afternoon
spent
here
offers
gentle
strolls
picnics
and
bird-watchingÂ âÂ a
welcome
respite
from
urban
frenzy
From
May
to
mid-October
the
Boston

Fort
Warren
19th-century
star-shaped
fortress
in
which
Confederate
prisoners
were
incarcerated
during
the
Civil
War
occupies
most
of
the
island
Itâs
an
atmospheric
and
spooky
place
with
old
gun
emplacements
lookout
posts
and
chilly
alleys
You
can
also
visit
five
other

One
of
the
most
exciting
experiences
you
can
have
in
Boston
is
whale-watching
From
April
through
to
October
literally
dozens
of
sightseeing
craft
from
Boston
and
other
ports
scattered
along
the
New
England
coast
head
out
to
an
area
known
as
Stellwagen
Bank
where
whales
stock
up
on
plankton
and
fish
before
migrating
to
warmer
Caribbean
climes
If
you
sail
from
Gloucester
and
Provincetown
which
are
closer
to
the
Bank
you
will
spend
less
time
getting
there
and
more
time
actually
looking
for
whales
For
details
of
sightseeing
and
whale-watching
trips
see
page
111
Humpbacks
are
most
commonly
spotted
but
you
might
also
spy
the
larger
fin
whales
(which
measure
up
to
80-ft
or
24-m
in
lengthÂ âÂ the
second
biggest
species
after
blue
whales)
and
swift
30-ft
(9-m)
-long
minkes
Youâre
almost
certain
to
glimpse
whale
In
fact
on
good
day
you
may
see
as
many
as
forty
(You
are
more
likely
to
see
greater
numbers
if
the
weather
is
poor;
take
seasickness
medicine
before
boarding.)
When
the
guideÂ âÂ who
is
usually
well-qualified
naturalistÂ âÂ makes
sighting
everyone
rushes
to
one
side
of
the
boat
causing
it
to
lurch
suddenly
The
boat
heads
off
toward
the
telltale
sign
of
the
spume
of
water
and
then
suddenly
there
it
is:
silvery
flank
virtually
underneath
the
boat
flick
of
tail
or
fluke
and
itâs
gone
If
you
are
very
lucky
you
may
see
the
rare
spectacle
of
whale
breaching
heaving
its
entire
body
out
of
the
water
At
times
it
seems
as
if
the
whales
themselves
are
doing
the
watching
when
they
approach
the
boats
swimming
underneath
them
and
staring
up
at
the
tourists
Back
Bay
and
The
Fenway
In
the
middle
of
the
19th-century
Boston
ended
at
Boston
Common
and
Back
Bay
was
just
polluted
tidal
flat
In
30
years
however
an
immense
landfill
project
transformed
it
into
the
cityâs
most
fashionable
residential
and
commercial
district
to
which
the
well-to-do
moved
from
Beacon
Hill
and
the
South
End
In
contrast
to
the
tangled
maze
of
lanes
of
the
âoldâ
city
Back
Bay
was
meticulously
planned
in
regimented
lines
inspired
by
the
boulevards
of
Paris
The
residential
district
North
of
Boylston
Street
contains
some
of
the
best
Victorian
architecture
in
the
country
Churches
and
Skyscrapers
From
the
Public

Boylston

Follow

Here
feast
of
contrasting
buildings
competes
for
your
attention
Sleek
blue
John
Hancock
Tower
New
Englandâs
tallest
building
rises
on
one
side
Two
sides
are
knife-edge
thin
and
from
certain
vantage
points
it
seems
as
if
the
building
virtually
disappears
When
it
was
built
in
1976
it
was
disaster
because
the
glass
blew
out
so
every
sheet
had
to
be
replaced
If
the
weather
is
fine
pay
visit
to
the
Observatory
on
the
60th
floor
Thereâs
no
better
way
to
get
to
grips
with
Bostonâs
peculiar
topography
model
of
the
city
in
1775
brings
home
just
how
much
of
the
present
land
was
under
water
at
one
time
People
feared
that
the
tower
would
eclipse
one
of
its
neighbors
Trinity
Church
but
the
beauty
of
Henry
Hobson
Richardsonâs
masterpiece
now
reflected
in
the
towerâs
glass
has
only
been
enhanced
The
church
has
been
named
by
the
AIA
one
of
the
nationâs
ten
best
buildings
In
1877
when
it
was
consecrated
it
cost
$750,000
For
that
amount
the
commissioners
purchased
the
great
stained
glass
windows
by
John
LaFarge
Edward
Burne-Jones
and
William
Morris
in
addition
to
the
building
itself
The
church
has
had
some
colorful
preachers
too
from
patriot
Sam
Parker
to
Phillips
Brooks
author
of
Little
Town
of
Bethlehem
and
prodigious
gourmet
who
also
loved
the
track
billiards
and
fly-fishing
Ironically
the
Hancock
tower
enriched
the
church
when
the
church
won
$11.6
million
in
suit
against
its
developers
for
damage
caused
during
construction
On
the
other
side
of
the
square
the
Boston
Public
Library
(1895)
the
oldest
free
municipal
library
in
the
world)
is
well
worth
visiting
The
grand
Italian
Renaissance
building
has
several
decorative
highlightsÂ âÂ the
bronze
doors
by
Daniel
Chester
French
at
the
Dartmouth
entrance
the
double
marble
staircase
graced
with
murals
by
Puvis
de
Chavannes
and
Edwin
Austin
Abbey
and
on
the
third
floor
by
John
Singer
Sargent
The
Johnson
Building
was
added
in
1972
and
now
the
library
holds
more
than
six
million
books
stored
on
65
miles
of
shelves

to

The
Skywalk
is

though
the
views
are
less
impressive
little
farther
along
Huntington

the
Christian
Science
World
Headquarters
may
not
sound
enticing
(and
indeed
the
austerity
of
the
administration

around

pool
makes
somber
first
impression)
Still
the
huge
basilica
of
the
First
Church
of
Christ
Scientist
huge
Byzantine-style
church
enveloping
the
original
Mother
Church
is
an
amazing
edifice
It
can
hold
4,000;
its
tiered
seating
makes
it
more
like
theater
than
place
of
worship
The
organ
which
is
the
focal
point
of
the
space
contains
13,595
pipes
covering
nine
octaves
Except
for
quotations
on
the
walls
from
the
New

and
Christian
Science
founder
Mary
Baker

thereâs
no

Some
stained

windows
are
found
in
the
older
church
which
also
contains
founder
Mary
Baker
Eddyâs
chair
She
only
addressed
the
congregation
twice
as
she
wished
to
avoid
any
personal
idolatry

highly
recommended
(you

The
Christian

You
can
stand
on

study
this
dramatic
object

Notice
the
architecture
as
well:
At

Bay
Village
and
the
South
End
The
few
blocks
of
tiny
Bay
Village
lie
well
hidden
in
between
the
Theater
District
and
Back
Bay
around
Winchester
Melrose
and
Fayette
streets
It
feels
somewhat
like
toy
villageÂ âÂ a
miniature
flat
version
of
Beacon
HillÂ âÂ with
similar
red-brick
and
black-shuttered
homes
lining
sidewalks
that
are
shaded
by
trees
and
lit
by
old-fashioned
street
lamps
These
were
the
homes
of
artisans
not
Brahmins
and
are
less
precious
devoid
of
cornices
and
fancy
wrought
iron
When
the
marsh
of
Back
Bay
was
filled
in
during
the
1860s
water
flooded
into
this
area
forcing
the
streets

In

any
âmust

if
you
have

and
are
confident
about
finding
your
way
around
with
good
map
there
is
variety
of
intriguing
places
to
explore
South
Boston
referred
to
as
Southie
is
in
fact
(rather
confusingly)
situated
east
of
Downtown
Home
to
such
establishments
as
Flanaganâs
Supermarket
and
the
Shannon
Tavern
on
its
main
thoroughfare
of
East
Broadway
itâs
thoroughly
and
proudly
Irish
In
fact
it
was
the
flashpoint
for
protests
and
riots
during
the
busing
controversy
in
the
1970s
Follow
the
main
street
past
its
old
wooden
and
brick
houses
down
to
Fort
Independence
which
stands
at
the
very
mouth
of
Boston
Inner
Harbor
The
fort
is
rarely
open
but
join
the
locals
who
settle
down
in
the
surrounding
park
with
deck
chairs
and
binoculars
to
watch
the
nautical
and
aeronautical
activity
Your
next
stop
could
well
be
Dorchester

three-tiered
tower

standing
on

From

You
can
watch
the
Kennedy/Nixon
debate
again
revisit
the
67-day
1960
campaign
and
see
Walter
Cronkite
reading
the
results
Other
exhibits
highlight
the
accomplishments
of
the
1,000
daysÂ âÂ the
resolution
of
the
Cuban
Missile
Crisis
the
founding
of
the
Peace
Corp
the
launching
of
the
space
program
and
the
support
for
Civil
Rights
The
film
footage
of
the
assassination
still
shocks
and
appalls
The
quotation
that
follows
âA
man
may
die
nations
may
rise
and
fall
but
an
idea
lives
onâ
though
reminds
us
of
an
earlier
political
time
when
visionary
ideas
mattered
more
than
gossip
to
the
media
commentators

Cambridge
Although
itâs
only
separated
from
Boston
by
river
and
few
subway
stops
Cambridge
is
distinct
city
with
distinct
outlook
Itâs
dominated
by
two
of
Americaâs
leading
academic
establishments
Harvard
and
MIT
and
although
there
is
community
outside
the
universities
visitors
should
begin
by
exploring
life
around
Harvard
Square
Harvard
Square
and
Harvard

Harvard
Square
itself
is
unkempt
What
makes
it
special
is
the
people
This
is
place
where
everyone
just
hangs
out
from
students
conversing
in
sententious
tones
to
punks
in
leather
and
professionals
in

Among
American
universities
Harvard
University
is
the
oldest
(founded
in
1636
as
training
ground
for
puritan

produced
numerous
Nobel

Note
the
statue
of
John
Harvard
labeled
as
the
founder
and
dated
1638
Itâs
called
the
statue
of
the
Three
Lies
because
it
isnât
John
Harvard
but
only
student
model;
he
wasnât
the
founder
only
the
first
benefactor
who
donated
his
400-book
library;
and
the
date
is
wrong
(it
should
be
1636)
So
much
for
Harvardâs
motto:
Veritas
the
Latin
for
âTruth.â

Harvard
has
several
fine
museums
The
most
enjoyable
is
the
Fogg
on
Quincy

just
off
the
northeast

The
collection
has
some
truly
fine
early

which
are
displayed
in
the
16th-century
Italian-style
loggia
modeled
on

The
collection
also
contains
some
fine
European
and
American
paintings

Nearby
the
Arthur

British
architect
James
Stirling
It
holds
an
important
collection
of
classical

origin
The
ancient
Chinese
bronzes
(some
dating
back
to
the
14th
century
b.c.)
and
the
carved
jades
from
the
Shang

are
particularly
rewarding

Less

Plymouth
doesnât
let
you

its
famous
heritage
but
unless
you
really
want
to
see
the
rock
that
marks
where
the

landed
in
1620
you
might
prefer
to
head

Fabulous

long
drawn
people
particularly

to
Cape
Cod
âthe
bare

In
summer
it
is
incredibly
crowded
and
so
if
you
can
you
should
avoid
the
Friday
evening
mass
exodus
(see

and
visit
during
the
week
or
off-season
when
itâs
only
an
hour
from
Boston
to
Sandwich
the
nearest
town
on
the

With
so
many
alluring
inns
however
why
not
plan
to
stay
overnight
but
make
sure
to
reserve
in
advance
Provincetown
is
right
at
the
end
of
the
Cape
and
in
summer
can
most
easily
be
reached
from
Boston
via
the
ferry
operated
by
Bay
State
Cruise
Company
(Tel

The
most
alluring
section
of
the
Cape
is
its
north
shore
and
âupper
arm.â

The

On
sunny
summerâs
day
parking

The
first
town
Sandwich
is
the
Capeâs
oldest
community
It
has
couple
of
sites
worth
visitingÂ âÂ the
Sandwich
Glass
Museum
and
the
Heritage
Plantation
The
first
displays
the
brilliantly
colored
glass
that
was
manufactured
here
in
the

the
second
is
an

Charles

where
you
can
see
dazzling
display
of
antique
cars
bird
carvings
by
Elmer
Crowell
beautifully
restored

and
more
The
gardens
alone
are
worth
visiting
especially
in
spring
when
the
rhododendrons
bloom
Several
of
the
sea
captainâs
homes
along
Brewsterâs
main
street
have
been

the
Atlantic
Ocean
you
can
listen
to
the
pounding
surf
and
stroll
the
awesome
beaches
that
are
backed
by
huge
dunes
Because
the
dunes
are
so
fragile
access
is
strictly
controlled
and
limited
to

at

Thereâs
an
even
better
view
from
the
top
of
the
253-ft

Pilgrim
Monument
in
Provincetown
Itâs
called
the
Pilgrim
monument
because
this
is
where
the
Pilgrims
actually
landed
first
before
moving
on
to
Plymouth
The
museum
at
the

of

P-Town
is
fabled
place
Although
the
main
street
is
crowded
and
lined
with
commercial
tourist
trinket
stores
it
still
has
magical
atmosphere
because
it
has
an
âanything
goesâ
attitude
It
is
the
East
Coastâs
gay
mecca
(along
with
the
Hamptons
and

Same-sex

and
to
enjoy
the
beaches
and
the
fishing
and
whale-watch
trips
In
the
early
20th
century
Provincetown
was
major
art
colony
and
there
are
still
numerous
art
galleries
particularly
at
the
east
end
of
town
In
summer
the
town
is
swamped
and
every
guesthouse
filled
In

itâs
quiet
Many
of
the
commercial
stores
close
and
only
the
residents
remainÂ âÂ a
community
of
artists
Portuguese
fishermen
and

of
restaurateurs
You
can
visit
Provincetown
for
day
(see

but
if
you
donât
stay
longer
youâll
miss
half
the
fun

visit

Manchester
Gloucester

in
most
cases
you
are
discharged
long

so
again
you
really

In

the

Brief
History
The
German
capital
became
municipality
during
the
1200s
ironically
as
divided
city
In
those
days
the
two
rival
halves
were
in
no
rush
to
unite
The
fishermen
of
CÃ¶lln
whose
name
survives
in
the
modern
borough
of
NeukÃ¶lln
lived
on
an
island
in
the
River
Spree
The
townships
that
comprise
the
modern
Mitte
district
grew
up
around
market
places
over
which
the
peopleâs
churches
the
Nikolaikirche
and
Marienkirche
still
tower
today
With
the
fortress
of
Burg
KÃ¶penick
providing
common
defense
to
the
south
CÃ¶lln
and
Berlin
formed
trade
center
between
Magdeburg
and
Poznan
In
region
inhabited
by
the
Slavonic
Sorbs
the
population
of
the
city
was
overwhelmingly
German
by
the
13th
century
comprising
enterprising
merchants
hailing
from
the
northern
Rhineland
Westphalia
and
Lower
Saxony
with
latecomers
from
Thuringia
and
the
Harz
Berlin
and
CÃ¶lln
came
together
in
1307
in
order
to
lead
the
Brandenburg
regionâs
defenses
and
defeat
the
robber
barons
who
were
terrorizing
merchants
and
local
peasants
The
prosperous
city
joined
the
Hanseatic
League
trading
in
rye
wool
and
oak
timber
and
providing
an
entrepÃ´t
for
skins
and
furs
from
eastern
Europe
Apparently
living
was
easy
in
the
15th
century
as
historian
Trithemius
noted:
âLife
here
consists
of
nothing
but
eating
and
drinking.â
Berlin
continued
as
virtually
autonomous
outpost
of
the
German
empire
until
1448
when
Brandenburgâs
KurfÃ¼rst
(Prince
Elector)
Friedrich
II
took
over
control
of
the
city
after
crushing
the
citizensâ
violent
resistance
the
so-called
Berliner
Unwillen
He
was
member
of
the
Hohenzollern
dynasty
that
was
to
hold
sway
here
for
over
450
years
The
independent
spirit
of
the
Berliners
was
felt
during
the
Reformation
in
the
16th
century
The
people
were
tired
of
paying
the
tribute
exacted
by
the
Catholic
church
In
1539
at
time
when
citizens
of
the
other
German
principalities
had
to
observe
the
religion
of
their
prince
Berliners
were
successful
in
pressuring
Prince
Elector
Joachim
II
to
accept
the
Protestant
creed
as
preached
by
Martin
Luther
Like
the
rest
of
Germany
the
city
was
devastated
by
the
Thirty
Yearsâ
War
(1618â1648)
Its
Brandenburg
rulers
tried
to
befriend
both
the
Protestant
and
Catholic
armies
but
made
enemies
of
both
leaving
unfortified
Berlin
to
pay
the
price
PrussiaÂ âÂ and
Napoleon
With
his
ambition
of
uniting
the
states
of
Brandenburg
and
Prussia
it
was
the
Great
Elector
Friedrich
Wilhelm
(1640â1688)
who
prepared
Berlin
to
become
strong
capital
and
fortified
it
as
garrison
town
The
first
newcomers
were
50
wealthy
Jewish
families
who
had
been
expelled
from
Vienna
in
1671
Then
14
years
later
5,600
Huguenot
Protestants
arrived
after
being
driven
out
of
France
by
the
revocation
of
the
Edict
of
Nantes
At
time
when
France
was
considered
the
cultural
master
of
Europe
these
sophisticated
merchants
and
highly
skilled
craftsmenÂ âÂ among
them
jewelers
tailors
chefs
and
restaurant-ownersÂ âÂ brought
new
refinement
to
the
town
This
was
further
enhanced
by
the
Great
Electorâs
son
who
in
1701
crowned
himself
in
KÃ¶nigsberg
(now
Kaliningrad)

Friedrich
Wilhelm
(1713â1740)
despised
the
baroque
glitter
of
his
parentsâ
court
and
subjected
the
previously
easy-going
Berliners
to
frugal
rigid
concept
of
Preussentum
(Prussianness)
that
is
unquestioning
obedience
to
the
ruler
and
his
administrators

Friedrich
der
GroÃe
(Frederick
the
Great
1740â1786)
King
of
(not
just
in)
Prussia
took
his
realm
to
the
forefront
of
European
politics
and
had
little
time
for
Berlin
He
concentrated
on
turning
his
beloved
Potsdam
into
mini-Versailles
where
French
was
spoken
and
Voltaire
became
his
official
philosopher-in-residence
He
rarely
appeared
in
Berlin
except
to
garner
public
supportÂ âÂ and
taxesÂ âÂ after
his
return
from
costly
wars
with
the
Silesians
Russians
and
Austrians
He
did
nevertheless
leave
the
German
capital
an
enduring
legacy
with
the
monumental
Forum
Fridericianum
laid
out
on
Unter
den
Linden
by
his
architect
von
Knobelsdorff
The
armies
of
Frederickâs
successors
proved
to
be
no
match
for
Napoleonâs

ArmÃ©e
however
and
as
the
French
advanced
through
eastern
Germany
in
1806
Berlinâs
bureaucracy
court
and
bourgeoisie
fled
to
the
country
No
troops
were
left
to
defend
the
city
from
its
invaders
and
Napoleonâs
march
through
the
Brandenburg

into
Berlin
kindled
new
flame
of

after
the
defeat

were
the
LesecafÃ©s
(reading

such
as

They
were

for
the
intelligentsia
who
met
to
read
foreign
and
provincial
newspapers
and
glean
information
withheld
in
the
heavily
censored
Berlin

Meanwhile
the
accelerating
industrial
revolution
had
produced
new

of
50,000
workers
In

in

and
Vienna

which
were
held
to

were

had
been
tightened

swarmed
with

Prussiaâs
success
during
the
Franco-Prussian
War
(1870â1871)
placed
it
at
the
head
of
new
united
Germany
Under
Kaiser
Wilhelm
and
Otto
von
Bismarck
Berlin
became
the
Reichshauptstadt
(capital
of
the
empire)
By
1880
amid
the
industrial
expansion
of
the
GrÃ¼nderzeit
(founding
years)
the
cityâs
population
soared
past
the
million
mark
Berlin
boomed
as
the
center
of
Germanyâs
machine
industry
and
was
perfect
market
for
mass-circulation
newspapers
and
big
department
stores
such
as
KaDeWe
(Kaufhaus
des
Westens)
founded
in
1907
After
that
philistine
period
of
rapid
growth
the
city
at
last
began
to
assume
its
place
as
Germanyâs
cultural
as
well
as
political
capital
with
Berlin
artists
Max
Liebermann
Lovis
Corinth
and
Max
Slevogt
challenging
Munichâs
dominance
of

The
Berlin
Philharmonic
asserted
an
international
prestige
attracting
Tchaikovsky
Strauss
and
Grieg
as
guest
composers
and
in
1905
the
great
Viennese
director
Max
Reinhardt
arrived
to
head
the
Deutsches

Among
its

Robert

won

War
and
Revolution
After
years
of
opposition
on
social
matters
Berliners
solidly
supported
what
proved
to
be
the
Hohenzollernsâ
last
military
gaspÂ âÂ World
War
I
At
the
start
of
the
hostilities
in
August
1914
people
gathered
in
thousands
to
cheer
the
Kaiser
at
the
royal
palace
The
enthusiasm
was
short-lived
Privations
at
home
and
the
horrendous
loss
of
life
on
the
front
turned
popular
feeling
against
the
war
In
1916
Karl
Liebknecht
and
Rosa
Luxemburg
formed
the
Spartacus
League
Two
years
later
with
Germany
defeated
and
insurrections
in
Kiel
Munich
Hamburg
and
Stuttgart
revolution
broke
out
in
Berlin
While
the
Social
Democrats
were
proclaiming
new
German
Republic
Liebknecht
took
over
the
palace
declaring
the
Republic
socialist
with
âsupreme
authority
for
the
workers
and
soldiers.â
Vehemently
opposed
to
any
Soviet-style
revolution
Chancellor
Friedrich
Ebert
and
his
Social
Democrats
outmaneuvered
the
Spartacists
The
ruthless
defense
minister
Gustav
Noske
called
in
4,000
Freikorps
(right-wing
storm-troopers)
to
smash
the
movement
They
assassinated
Liebknecht
and
Luxemburg
on
15
January
1919
(A
plaque
on
the
LÃ¼tzowufer
marks
the
post
where
Rosa
Luxemburgâs
body
was
fished
out
of
the
Landwehr
canal.)
Four
days
later
new
National
Assembly
was
elected
and
the
dominant
Social
Democrats
moved
the
government
to
the
safety
of
Weimar
240
km
(150
miles)
southwest
of
Berlin
to
draw
up
the
constitution
of
the
new
Republic
The
Crazy
Twenties
The
use
of
the
Freikorps
to
suppress
the
Spartacists
was
to
haunt
the
Weimar
Republic
In
March
1920
the
Kapp
Putsch
brought
5,000
of
the
storm-troopers
into
Berlin
with
an
obscure
civil
servant
Wolfgang
Kapp
installed
as
puppet
chancellor
The
coup
lasted
only
five
days
but
set
the
tone
for
Germanyâs
fragile
experiment
in
parliamentary
democracy
The
swastika
displayed
on
the
helmets
of
the
Freikorps
was
to
reappear
on
the
armbands
of
Hitlerâs
storm-troopers
crushing
all
democracy
in
1933
The
turbulent
twenties
gave
Berlin
special
place
in
the
worldâs
popular
imagination
In
1920
the
incorporation
of
townships
and
some
60
suburban
communities
into
the
metropolis
effectively
doubled
Berlinâs
population
overnight
to
million
Before
democracy
was
extinguished
in
1933
the
city
led
charmed
life
of
exciting
creativity
that
left
its
mark
on
the
whole
of
European
culture
Defeat
in
World
War
had
shattered
the
rigid
certainties
of
Berlinâs
âPrussiannessâ
and
left
the
town
open
to
radical
adventures
in
social
and
artistic
expression
almost
unimaginable
in
the
older
cultural
capitals
of
Vienna
London
and
Paris
Artists
of
the
avant-garde
intellectual
movement
known
as
Dada
called
for
state
prayers
to
be
replaced
by
simultaneous
poetry
and
regularization
of
sexual
intercourse
via
Central
Dada
Sex
Office
Many
years
before
the
New
York
âhappeningsâ
of
the
1960s
Berlin
Dadaists
were
organizing
races
between
sewing
machine
and
typewriter
with
writer
Walter
Mehring
and
artist
Georg
Grosz
as
jockeys
In
the
meantime
nightclubs
on
TauentzienstraÃe
provided
combination
of
political
satire
and
striptease
and
sharp
analysis
of
world
affairs
was
accompanied
by
plenty
of
alcohol
cocaine
and
sexual
license
The
paintings
of
Otto
Dix
Georg
Grosz
and
Max
Beckmann
were
brutally
realist
and
the
dissonance
of
the
times
was
aptly
captured
by
the
atonal
music
composed
by
Arnold
SchÃ¶nberg
and
his
pupil
Alban
Berg
The
conservative
establishment
winced
when
the
Prussian
Writersâ
Academy
chose
as
its
president
Heinrich
Mann
the
elder
brother
of
Thomas
Mann
violent
critic
of
the
German
bourgeoisie
and
supporter
of
the

Fritz

F.W
Murnau
G.W

While
Hollywood
had
considered

Hitler
wanted
the
master
of
the
dark
spectacle
to
make

films
for
him
Berlin
was
going
through
wild
time
but
the
Versailles
peace
treaty
had
laid
heavy
burdens
on
the
nation
At
the
start
of
the
twenties
inflation
had
made
little
more
than
nonsense
of
the
German
currency
and
political
assassinations
became
routine
The
most
significant
of
the
victims
was
foreign
minister
Walther
Rathenau
an
enlightened
democrat
and
Jew
who
was
killed
near
the
Grunewald
forest
It
was
also
the
time
of
vicious
street
battles
between
Communists
and
Nazis
exploiting
the
social
disruptions
of
inflation
and
unemployment
that
were
impossible
to
ignore
The

Communist
hostility

Hitler
became
Chancellor
on
30
January
1933
Only
month
later
on
27
February
the
Reichstag
went
up
in
flames
Hitler
used
the
fire
as
pretext
to
eliminate
Communist
and
all
left-wing
opposition
from
German
political
life
The
Nazi
reign
of

had
begun

an
attempt
at

which
was
soundly
destroyed
by

won
four

In
deference
to
foreign
visitors
all
anti-Semitic
signs
such
as
Juden
unerwÃ¼nscht
(Jews
not
wanted)
were
removed
from
shops
hotels
and
cafÃ©s
As
soon
as
the
foreigners
had
left
town
the
signs
went
up
again
Discrimination
against
Jews
moved
inexorably
to
the
night
of
November
1938
when
synagogues
and
other
Jewish-owned
buildings
were
burned
In
the
midst
of
the
smashed
glass
of
the
looted
shops
German
wit
eased
the
discomfort
by
referring
to
the
event
as
Kristallnacht
(Crystal
Night)
Berlinâs
Jewish
population
which
stood
at
170,000
in
1933
was
reduced

World
War

In
the
autumn
of
1938
Hitler
was
put
out
that
Berliners
did
not
share
his
enthusiasm
for
the
cavalcade
of
troops
driving
through
the
city
The
army
was
preparing
its
march
into
what
used
to
be
Czechoslovakia
but
onlookers
shared
none
of
the
fervor
that
had
greeted
military
parades
in
1914
Their
disquiet
was
shortly
to
be
justified
by
the
hail
of
bombs
on
the
capital
The
first
attacks
came
in
1940
from
the
British
in
retaliation
for
the
air
raids
on
London
Attacks
were
stepped
up
after
the
German
defeat
at
Stalingrad
in
1943
with
Anglo-American
âcarpet-bombing.â
The
worst
single
raid
was
on
February
1945
when
bombs
wiped
out
sq
km
(1
1â2
sq

of
the
city
center
in
one
hour
Hitler
spent
the
last
days
of
the
war
in
his
bunker
at
the
Reich
chancellery
As
Soviet
troops
moved
in
to
capture
the
city
he
killed
himself
with
shot
through
the
mouth
The
war
ended
with
unconditional
German
surrender
on
May
1945
In
Berlin
the
population
was
left
to
pick
up
the
piecesÂ âÂ literally
Women
formed
groups
of
TrÃ¼mmerfrauen
(rubble
women)
with
60,000
of
them
passing
the
debris
of

by
hand
to
clear
ground
for

Eventually
there
was
sufficient

to
create
few
artificial

the
British
mainly
in

from

Tiergarten
to
Spandau
and
the
Americans
in
the
sprawling
southwest
corner
from
Kreuzberg
out
to
the
Grunewald
and
Wannsee
Hard
political
realities
soon
developed
from
these
administrative
divisions
as
the
Allies
found
themselves
confronted
with
Soviet
efforts
to
incorporate
the
whole
of
Berlin
into
new
Communist-controlled
German
Democratic
Republic
In
the
1946
municipal
electionsÂ âÂ Berlinâs
first
free
vote
since
1933
and
its
last
until
1990Â âÂ the
Social
Democrats
won
crushing
victory
over
the
Communists
prompting
the
Soviets
to
tighten
their
grip
on
the
eastern
sector
Understandably
unhappy
that
West
Berlinâs
capitalist
presence
in
the
middle
of
East
Germany
was
having
subversive
influence
on
the
Communist
experiment
the
Soviets
and
their
East
German
allies
began
to
restrict
traffic
from
West
Germany
In
June
1948
all
road
rail
and
waterway
routes
to
West
Berlin
were
sealed
off
From
bases
in
Frankfurt
Hamburg
and
Hanover
the
Western
Allies
countered
the
blockade
by
airlifting
into
Berlin
between
4,000
and
8,000
tons
of
food
and
other
vital
supplies
every
day
for
11
months
The
blockade
finally
ended
in
May
1949
and
West
Berlin
became
Land
linked
administratively
with
but
thus
far
not
politically
incorporated
into
the
new
Federal
Republic
of
Germany
East
Berlin
was
made
capital
of
the
fledgling
German
Democratic
Republic
Discontent
with
the
living
conditions
in
East
Berlin
first
erupted
into
open
revolt
on
17
June
1953
Striking
construction
workers
marched
down
Stalinallee
(which
was
later
renamed
Karl-Marx-Allee)
and
mounted
violent
demonstrations
against
the
government
of
Walter
Ulbricht
They
were
protesting
against
the
state
demands
for
increased
productivity
while
their
standard
of
living
continued
to
compare
unfavorably
with
that
of
West
Berlin
The
revolt
was
crushed
by
Soviet
tanks
By
the
end
of
the
1950s
the
flow
of
refugees
to
the
West
had
reached
disastrous
proportions
for
East
Germany
Over
million
citizens
had
fled
the
country
over
half
of
them
through
Berlin
where
border
controls
were
only
perfunctory
When
Soviet
leader
Nikita
Khrushchev
decided
to
stop
the
hemorrhage
the
country
was
losing
millions
of
marks
invested
in
the
training
of
doctors
engineers
and
other
highly
skilled
workers
seeking
better
wages
in
the
West
In
the
early
hours
of
13
August
1961
East
German
workers
and
soldiers
began
to
erect
the
wall
that
would
separate
East
and
West
Berlin
and
change
the
lives
of
several
million
people
for
nearly
30
years
The
wall
started
out
as
barbed
wire
and
road
blocks
but
refugees
continued
to
make
their
way
through
the
barriers
by
swimming
through
sewers
and
canals
and
jumping
from
buildings
and
railway
bridgesÂ âÂ risking
life
and
limb
for
freedom
and
democracy
Soon
huge
slabs
of
reinforced
concrete
and
tank-traps
formed
more
impenetrable
barrier
Crossing
points
were
established
for
foreigners
and
for
West
Germans
but
not
for
Berliners
until
tiny
few
were
allowed
across
much
later
in
the
Cold
War
confrontation
For
the
Western
Alliance
the
Wall
made
West
Berlin
an
even
more
powerful
propaganda
symbol
of
democratic
freedom
On
his
visit
in
1963
US
President
John
F
Kennedy
dramatically
underlined
the
Western
Alliesâ
commitment
to
the
city
with
his
famous
proclamation:
âIch
bin
ein
Berliner.â
The
erection
of
the
Wall
did
significantly
reduce
the
flow
of
refugees
to
few
isolated
escapes
but
the
East
German
economy
suffered
even
more
from
the
assaults
of
massive
mismanagement
and
high-level
corruption
Erich
Honeckerâs
regime
won
international
diplomatic
recognition
for
East
Berlin
as
its
capital
and
with
gleaming
hotels
and
skyscrapers
tried
to
give
it
lustre
to
rival
West
Berlin
Beneath
the
surface
however
the
drabness
of
daily
life
and
lack
of
personal
freedom
continued
to
undermine
any
chance
of
popular
support
The
final
push
which
led
to
the
collapse
of
the
Berlin
Wall
came
when
an
ecological
campaign
in
Leipzig
against
nuclear
weapons
and
industrial
pollution
grew
into
nationwide
pressure
for
democratic
freedom
In
1989
with
thousands
of
East
Germans
fleeing
to
the
West
via
Hungary
Czechoslovakia
and
Poland
the
country
was
swept
up
in
the
wave
of
eastern
European
revolutions
unleashed
by
the
reforms
of
Soviet
leader
Mikhail
Gorbachev
His
visit
to
East
Berlin
in
October
1989
for
the
40th
anniversary
of
the
German
Democratic
Republic
left
it
clear
that
Soviet
troops
would
no
longer
shore
up
its
regime
The
Berlin
Wall
was
opened
on
November
1989
and
at
midnight
on
October
1990
huge
black
red
and
gold
national
flag
was
hoisted
at
the
Reichstag
East
and
West
Berlin
were
again
one
The
City
Today
With
population
in
June
1990
of
almost
1â2
million
Berlin
was
far
and
away
Germanyâs
largest
city
and
quickly
declared
the
national
capital
again
International
businessmen
and
bankers
flocked
into
town
but
Bonn
understandably
as
well
as
many
provincial
politicians
opposing
too
great
concentration
of
power
in
Berlin
were
reluctant
to
see
all
the
affairs
of
government
desert
the
banks
of
the
Rhine
Turning
its
back
on
its
left-wing
tradition
the
city
elected
in
1990
conservative
mayor
to
cope
with
the
enormous
day-to-day
problems
in
housing
employment
and
transport
arising
from
reunification
On
20
June
1991
the
cityâs
role
at
the
hub
of
German
life
was
assured
when
the
Bundestag
voted
by
slim
majority
to
restore
Berlin
as
the
seat
of
government
In
May
1999
federal
President
was
elected
at
the
Reichstag
and
in
August
that
year
government
business
again
began
to
be
conducted
from
Berlin
The
Reichstag
was
transformed
by
the
addition
of
vast
glass
dome
designed
by
Sir
Norman
Foster
to
symbolize
that
the
new
Germany
keeps
no
secrets
from
its
people
Berlin
continued
its
transformation
in
the
year
2000
as
new
foreign
embassies
were
erected
many
in
their
pre-War
locations
and
old
ones
refurbished
in
preparation
for
increased
foreign
diplomatic
representation
in
Germanyâs
capital
The
21st
century
will
no
doubt
continue
to
see
Germany
playing
determining
role
in
the
shaping
of
new
Europe
Brief
History
Hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
before
China
was
to
become
the
worldâs
longest-running
civilization
the
prologue
was
enacted
by
means
of
the
flicker
of
carefully
tended
fire
Peking
Man
forebear
of
Homo
sapiens
achieved
mastery
of
fire
We
might
call
it
the
first
Chinese
invention
Not
that
he
devised
flint
and
steel
matches
or
any
other
way
of
creating
fire
Peking
Man
simply
learned
how
to
capture
flame
perhaps
from
forest
fire
and
keep
it
alight
He
thus
enjoyed
two
revolutionary
luxuries:
light
and
heat
Technologically
and
sociologically
it
was
phenomenal
breakthrough:
with
fire
communities
could
live
year
âround
in
one
cave
in
which
cooking
and
even
smelting
could
be
pursued
And
so
by
600,000
b.c.
about
50
km
(31
miles)
southwest
of
present-day
Beijing
the
ancestors
of
mankind
were
ready
to
settle
down
Several
hundred
thousand
years
later
when
Marco
Polo
reached
the
capital
of
China
he
was
astonished
by
further
development
in
fire
technology
The
Chinese
he
announced
used
black
stones
dug
out
of
mountains
as
fuel
Europeans
did
not
yet
have
word
for
âcoal,â
nor
had
they
discovered
use
for
it
The
First
Dynasty
The
confluence
of
mythology
and
history
in
China
took
place
around
4,000
years
ago
during
what
is
referred
to
as
the
Xia
(Hsia)
Dynasty
This
was
still
the
Stone
Age
but
the
people
are
thought
to
have
made
silk
from
thread
produced
by
the
worms
they
cultivated
on
the
leaves
of
their
mulberry
trees
And
written
language
(which
evolved
as
early
as
4,500
to
5,000
years
ago)
was
already
in
use
originally
by
oracles
and
then
by
official
scribesÂ âÂ Chinaâs
first
scholars
During
the
second
of
the
quasi-legendary
dynasties
the
Shang
(from
about
the
16th
to
11th
centuries
b.c.)
the
Chinese
developed
an
interest
in
art
Careful
geometric
designs
as
well
as
dragon
and
bird
motifs
adorned
bowls
and
implements
And
with
the
arrival
of
the
Bronze
Age
the
Chinese
created
bronze
vessels
of
such
beauty
and
originality
that
until
modern
times
archaeologists
refused
to
believe
they
were
cast
3,000
years
ago
The
Shang
Dynasty
gave
rise
to
the
concept
of
one
Chinese
nation
under
one
government
Among
the
advances
of
the
era
were
the
introduction
of
astronomical
calculations
chariots
the
use
of
cowrie
shells
as
unit
of
exchange
the
construction
of
palaces
and
temples
and
the
refinement
of
table
manners
through
the
introduction
of
chopsticks
The
most
durable
dynasty
in
the
long
history
of
China
followed
the
Shang:
the
Zhou
(Chou)
which
kept
power
from
the
11th
to
fifth
centuries
b.c
Chinese
boundaries
were
expanded
land
reform
was
instituted
and
towns
were
built
But
perhaps
more
significantly
the
declining
years
of
the
Zhou
era
produced
two
of
Chinaâs
most
influential
thinkers
In
the
rest
of
the
world
Chinaâs
supreme
sage
Kongfuzi
(Kâung
Fu-tzu)
is
better
known
by
the
romanized
name
âConfucius.â
He
was
born
in
551
b.c
in
what
is
now
Shandong
Province
in
eastern
China
So
profound
was
his
influence
that
eleven
Chinese
emperors
made
pilgrimages
to
the
birthplace
of
the
Great
Teacher
You
too
can
pay
your
respects
at
the
vast
temple
raised
on
the
site
of
his
home
in
the
small
town
of
Qufu
(Chufu)
and
at
his
tomb
in
the
woods
just
to
the
north
The
classics
of
Confucius
while
seldom
addressing
spiritual
and
metaphysical
matters
set
standards
for
social
and
political
conduct
that
still
underlie
many
of
the
Chinese
ways
of
doing
and
perceiving
Confucius
laid
great
stress
on
the
proper
and
harmonious
relationships
between
ruler
and
subject
parent
and
child
teacher
and
student
the
individual
and
the
state
These
relationships
were
deemed
to
be
hierarchical
and
dictatorial
If
the
order
was
disturbed
dire
consequences
inevitably
resulted
The
son
who
disobeyed
the
father
would
bring
disaster
upon
himself
and
his
family
just
as
the
emperor
who
defied
the
âmandate
of
heavenâ
or
ignored
the
good
of
the
empire
brought
ruin
upon
the
nation
Over
the
centuries
Confucius
has
suffered
more
changes
of
fortune
than
probably
any
other
philosopher
Honored
soon
after
his
death
as
the
greatest
of
scholars
he
was
later
revered
as
semi-divine;
you
can
still
visit
temples
to
Confucius
in
many
Chinese
cities
During
the
Cultural
Revolution
(1966â1976)
however
he
was
denounced
as
counter-revolutionary
force
It
was
only
after
the
death
of
Chairman
Mao
(1976)
and
the
opening
of
China
to
the
outside
world
under
more
progressive
reformers
that
Confucius
too
was
ârehabilitated.â
Unlike
Confucius
about
whose
life
many
specific
and
even
colorful
details
are
known
the
philosopher
Laozi
(Lao
Tse
or
Lao-Tzu)
is
an
enigma
Estimates
of
his
date
of
birth
vary
by
well
over
century
One
legend
even
says
he
taught
the
young
Confucius
Laozi
is
immortalized
by
his
book
of
thoughts
on
man
nature
and
the
universe
Daodejing
(âThe
Way
and
Its
Powerâ)
which
became
the
major
text
of
Chinaâs
greatest
indigenous
religion
Daoism
(Taoism)
With
its
emphasis
on
nature
intuition
the
individual
paradox
(âthe
knowledge
which
is
not
knowledgeâ)
and
the
cosmic
flow
known
as
âthe
Way,â
Daoism
became
the
religion
of
artists
and
philosophers
After
the
death
of
Confucius
the
Zhou
Dynasty
entered
period
of
strife
known
as
the
âWarring
Statesâ
period
(475â221
b.c.)
Orthodox
Communist
histories
make
the
advent
of
this
era
the
dividing
line
between
âslave
societyâ
and
âfeudal
society.â
It
would
give
birth
to
the
first
emperor
to
unify
China
The
Chinese
Empire
The
word
China
is
relatively
recent
innovation
believed
to
be
derived
by
foreigners
from
the
name
âQinâ
(Châin)
the
first
dynasty
to
unify
China
after
the
Warring
States
period
China
of
course
is
non-Chinese
term
Even
today
the
Chinese
still
call
their
nation
âZhongguoâ
(literally
âCentral
Kingdomâ)
referring
to
its
position
at
the
center
of
the
universe
in
respect
to
both
heaven
and
earth
Under
the
First
Emperor
Qinshi
Huangdi
(221â206
b.c.)
the
empire
was
organized
along
strict
lines
Land
was
divided
into
provinces
and
prefectures
with
power
vested
in
central
government
staffed
by
highly
educated
bureaucrats
Disapproved
books
were
burned
and
dissidents
executed
or
exiled
Canals
roads
and
the
Great
Wall
were
built
under
the
auspices
of
an
extensive
public
works
program
staffed
mostly
by
conscripts
Official
decrees
standardized
weights
and
measures
and
even
the
axle
dimensions
of
all
wagons
(the
latter
edict
kept
transport
in
the
same
ruts
for
countless
years)
You
can
visit
site
of
the
Qin
Dynasty
today
at
Xiâan
where
the
First
Emperorâs
terra
cotta
army
was
unearthed
in
1974
(see
page
185)
The
great
Han
Dynasty
(206
b.c.âa.d
220)
which
followed
the
Qin
consolidated
the
imperialistic
order
Civil
servants
were
selected
by
competitive
exams
the
centralized
government
standardized
currency
and
the
âSilk
Roadâ
across
central
Asia
opened
up
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
world
On
the
military
front
the
Han
triumphed
over
marauding
Huns
and
the
Central
Asian
nomads
and
Chinese
sovereignty
was
extended
almost
to
todayâs
frontiers
The

Intellectuals
who
had
been
harried
by
the
Qin
were
encouraged
in
their
creative
endeavors;
with
the
invention
of
paper
the
influence
of
their
writings
spread
Sculpture
ceramics
and
silk
manufacture
flourished
And
Buddhism
new
religion
came
to
China
from
India
via
Tibet;
it
was
to
have
an
enduring
effect
on
Chinese
life
and
art
Like
many
dynasties
before
and
after
the
Han
succession
ended
in
new
struggle
for
power
and
anarchy
As
result
the
nation
was
split
into
three
competing
kingdoms
The
era
of
the
Three
Kingdoms
lasted
only
about
half
century
but
it
had
as
legacy
some
thrilling
tales
of
derring-do
that
later
inspired
various
plays
and
classic
Ming
Dynasty
novel
And
the
first
mention
of
tea-drinking
in
China

in
the
third
century
footnote
of
fascination
for
social
historians
Over
the
next
several
hundred
years
series
of
dynasties
some
led
by
foreign
rulers
held
power
under
almost
constant
threat
from
usurpers
at
home
and
abroad
During
this
unsettled
period
many
people
moved
to
the
south;
the
Yangzi
(Yangtze)
valley
developed
into
the
leading
center
of
Chinese
culture
As
for
foreign
invaders
they
brought
new
ideas
but
as
often
happened
in
Chinese
history
were
assimilated
into
the
more
advanced
society
of
the
Middle
Kingdom
National
unity
and
strength
were
renewed
under
the
Sui
Dynasty
(a.d
581â618)
brief
prelude
to
the
highest
achievements
of
Chinese
art
The
Sui
built
stately
new
metropolis
at
Changâan
near
the
site
of
the
old
Han
capital
(present-day
Xiâan
in
Shaanxi
Province)
They
also
began
work
on
the
Grand
Canal
which
was
to
link
the
rice-growing
areas
of
the
Yangzi
valley
with
Beijing
an
engineering
achievement
comparable
to
the
construction
of
the
Great
Wall
The
Glory
of
the
Tang
In
the
realm
of
culture
no
era
of
Chinese
history
has
surpassed
the
Tang
(Tâang)
Dynasty
(618â907)
during
which
poetry
and
art
reached
brilliant
apex
Chinaâs
Imperial
Academy
of
Letters
was
founded
about
900
years
before
any
such
institution
was
established
in
Europe
The
first
known
printed
book
Buddhist
scripture
was
published
in
China
in
868
The
capital
city
Changâan
had
population
of
more
than
million
which
was
far
more
people
than
contemporaneous
European
cities
had
In
Changâan
extravagant
palaces
and
temples
were
interspersed
with
markets
stocked
with
exotica
from
as
far
away
as
Byzantium
Foreign
traders
journeyed
here
to
purchase
silk
porcelain
and
spices
and
by
so
doing
incidentally
introduced
the
Chinese
to
foreign
ideas
Scholars
poets
and
artists
all
achieved
prominence
Encyclopedias
were
compiled
and
poetry
evolved
metric
system
and
lines
that
rhymed
As
Buddhism
gained
strength
and
took
on
Chinese
character
it
inspired
the
construction
of
great
temples
and
pagodas
adorned
with
frescoes
and
statues
Artists
painted
sensitive
landscapes
and
perfected
the
subtle
brushwork
of
calligraphy
Sculptors
excelled
in
portraying
lifelike
human
animal
and
religious
figures
Yet
by
the
beginning
of
the
tenth
century
the
Tang
rulers
had
lost
their
grip
on
the
country
Revenues
from
tax
collection
dwindled
ambitious
palace
eunuchs
plotted
reform
schemes
failed
and
rebellious
forces
threatened
The
emperors
distributed
their
largess
to
too
many
warlords
hoping
to
pacify
them
By
907
the
people
could
see
through
all
the
turmoil
and
confusion
that
the
dynasty
had
lost
the
âmandate
of
heaven,â
and
so
it
was
that
the
last
of
the
Tang
monarchs
abdicated
Chinese
historians
designate
the
next
50
years
as
the
era
of
âThe
Five
Dynasties
and
the
Ten
Kingdoms.â
This
transitional
period
was
marred
by
political
and
military
infighting
and
by
rivalry
intrigue
and
cruelty
Then
an
able
general
named
Zhaokuangyin
(Chao
Kâuang-yin)
came
onto
the
scene
and
founded
the
Song
(Sung)
Dynasty
(960â1280)
which
ensured
Chinese
cultural
supremacy
for
the
next
three
centuries
The
number
of
cities
in
China
increased
dramatically
under
the
Song
mostly
in
the
Yangzi
valley
and
in
the
southeast
Where
there
were
cities
there
were
scholars
artists
and
artisans
Movable
type
revolutionized
printing
books
became
more
common
and
literacy
increased;
Chinese
scientists
published
works
on
botany
astronomy
mathematics
and
geography
Emperors
appointed
court
painters
and
glazed
porcelain
was
received
abroad
with
admiration
and
awe
But
while
art
and
scholarship
continued
to
thrive
the
political
and
military
situation
deteriorated
under
the
Song
Foreign
invaders
chipped
away
at
the
fringes
of
the
empire
Taxpayers
groaned
under
the
burden
of
the
army
and
the
tribute
paid
to
foreign
rivals
and
complained
about
the
luxuries
of
palace
life
Disaster
was
inevitable:
invaders
from
Manchuria
forced
the
Song
to
retreat
to
the
south
And
the
Mongol
invaders
headed
by
the
redoubtable
Genghis
Khan
swept
across
China
bringing
the
whole
country
under
foreign
rule
for
the
first
time
Under
Mongol
Rule
poignant
drama
signaled
the
Mongol
conquest
of
China
(1279â1368)
After
20
years
of
resistance
the
Song
armies
were
finally
ready
to
capitulate
The
boy
emperor
was
hidden
aboard
ship
But
when
it
was
surrounded
by
enemy
craft
the
last
of
the
loyal
commanders
seized
the
eight-year-old
monarch
in
his
arms
and
leaped
with
him
to
death
in
the
sea
The
new
era
known
as
the
Yuan
Dynasty
lasted
less
than
century
Creativity
declined
but
the
new
ruler
of
China
Kublai
Khan
(who
was
grandson
of
the
great
Genghis
Khan)
had
an
open
mind
and
generally
humane
attitude
towards
his
new
subjects
He
appointed
Chinese
bureaucrats
and
scholars
to
help
rule
the
country
Foreign
historians
generally
conclude
that
Kublai
Khan
became
an
âalmost
authenticâ
Chinese
emperor
that
the
conquerors
changed
more
profoundly
than
the
conquered
The
capital
of
the
new
empire
was
built
on
the
site
of
present-day
Beijing
and
was
called
âDaduâ
or
in
Mongolian
âCambalucâÂ âÂ spelled
Kanbalu
by
that
most
renowned
of
medieval
travelers
Marco
Polo
His
account
of
the
vast
new
capital
throbs
with
admiration
for
the
palaces
and
bazaars
and
the
profusion
of
shade
trees
He
regards
with
wonder
the
Great
Khanâs
religious
tolerance
all-encompassing
generosity
and
admirable
taste
in
wives
He
reports
all
manner
of
innovations
not
least
the
invention
of
paper
money
(Counterfeiting
he
reports
had
also
been
discovered.)
Marco
Poloâs
account
of
life
in
legendary
Cathay
was
received
with
incredulity
in
Europe
where
it
was
suggested
that
his
imagination
had
run
wild
What
else
could
the
citizens
of
Venice
make
of
his
report
that
the
ânoble
and
magnificent
city
of
Kin-saiâ
(now
Hangzhou)
had
12,000
bridges
many
so
high
that
sailing
ships
could
pass
under
them?
In
England
schoolboys
came
to
call
whopping
exaggeration
âMarco
Polo.â
With
the
death
of
Kublai
Khan
(in
1294
at
age
80)
the
Mongols
started
to
lose
their
grip
on
China
The
great
emperorâs
successors
lacked
his
vision
and
vigor
Insurrection
was
in
the
air
met
by
oppression
and
resulting
in
ever
more
sustained
resistance
Finally
full-scale
uprising
led
by
peasant
general
Zhuyuanzhang
(Chu
YÃ¼an-chang)
routed
the
Yuan
rulers
In
1368
Zhuyuanzhang
assumed
the
throne
of
the
Middle
Kingdom
founding
yet
another
dynasty
of
brilliant
promiseÂ âÂ the
Ming
The
Elegance
of
Ming
In
Chinese
the
word
Ming
is
written
as
composite
of
the
characters
for
âsunâ
and
âmoon,â
which
are
combined
to
mean
âbrilliantâ
or
âglorious.â
In
fact
the
dynasty
(1368â1644)
didnât
quite
live
up
to
its
name
Beauty
was
achieved
in
architecture
sculpture
and
the
decorative
arts
But
literature
now
serving
an
ever-wider
audience
produced
few
masterworks
and
philosophy
saw
no
new
developments
Science
which
had
been
far
more
advanced
than
in
Europe
was
so
gravely
neglected
that
China
became
technological
backwater
Perhaps
to
compensate
for
the
Mongol
interlude
the
Ming
emperors
opted
for
traditional
Chinese
values
The
keeper
of
the
âmandate
of
heavenâ
played
his
role
to
the
autocratic
hilt
while
bureaucrats
kept
their
jobs
(and
heads)
by
paying
him
lip
service
Conservatism
and
hostility
to
foreign
ideas
however
couldnât
be
absolutely
maintained
During
the
Ming
era
China
imported
tobacco
pineapples
peanuts
and
syphilis
Thanks
to
the
emancipated
Confucian
tradition
Christian
missionaries
were
usually
welcomed
although
they
hardly
achieved
mass
conversions
From
the
Jesuits
the
Chinese
learned
mathematics
and
astronomy;
the
old
observatory
still
stands
in
downtown
Beijing
At
first
the
Ming
headquarters
were
moved
south
to
the
Yangzi
River
port
of
Nanjing
(âSouthern
Capitalâ)
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
15th
century
the
capital
returned
to
what
was
now
renamed
Beijing
(âNorthern
Capitalâ)
Here
Ming
architects
and
artisans
produced
some
of
Chinaâs
most
elegant
palaces
temples
and
parks
including
the
Forbidden
City
and
Temple
of
Heaven
masterpieces
that
survive
today
The
move
northward
made
the
supervision
of
defense
efforts
on
the
ever-sensitive
borders
of
the
empire
easier
The
Ming
rulers
oversaw
the
construction
and
renovation
of
the
Great
Wall
sections
that
millions
of
tourists
visit
today
but
this
wall-building
eventually
proved
incapable
of
keeping
out
enemies
By
the
17th
century
after
repeated
forays
infiltrations
and
invasions
forces
from
Manchuria
capitalized
on
domestic
upheavals
in
China
to
take
power
in
Beijing
almost
by
default
Consolidating
control
over
the
rest
of
the
country
though
was
long
and
brutal
business
The
Manchu
invaders
called
their
new
dynasty
the
Qing
(Châing)
Fated
to
be
the
last
of
all
the
Chinese
dynasties
it
held
power
until
modern
times
(1644â1911)
Pigtails
and
Prosperity
The
invading
âbarbarians,â
the
Manchu
adopted
all
the
refinements
of
Chinese
civilization
installing
regime
so
conservative
that
it
began
to
hold
back
progress
But
for
all
their
Confucian
outlook
and
traditionalism
the
Manchu
imposed
one
singular
feature
of
their
own
culture:
the
wearing
of
pigtails
Ironically
this
was
one
peculiarity
the
rest
of
the
world
came
to
consider
typically
Chinese
One
of
the
most
dynamic
emperors
was
Kangxi
(Kâang-hsi)
who
reigned
at
almost
the
same
time
as
Louis
XIV
of
France
He
presided
over
period
of
prosperity
and
positive
achievement
rebuilding
Beijing
encouraging
scholarship
and
expanding
the
empire
to
its
greatest
area
By
the
standards
of
his
predecessors
Kangxi
lived
modestly
enough;
his
concubines
numbered
no
more
than
300
Under
the
Emperor
Qianlong
(Châien
Lung)
Kangxiâs
grandson
conflict
arose
between
Europeâs
empires
and
the
Middle
Kingdom
Englandâs
King
George
III
sent
an
emissary
to
negotiate
conventional
diplomatic
and
trade
relations
The
emperor
flatly
turned
him
down
but
thanked
him
for
showing
such
âsubmissive
loyalty
in
sending
this
tribute
mission.â
No
insult
appears
to
have
been
intended
even
though
the
message
referred
to
England
as
âthe
lonely
remoteness
of
your
island
cut
off
from
the
world
by
intervening
wastes
of
sea.â
China
sincerely
believed
itself
to
be
the
center
of
the
world:
it
had
nothing
to
learn
or
gain
from
so-called
foreign
devils
But
such
sublime
self-assurance
was
to
be
short-lived
The
soaring
demand
in
Europe
for
Chinese
tea
silk
and
porcelain
brought
increasing
pressure
for
freer
trade
However
the
Chinese
were
stubborn
Needing
no
commodities
they
would
accept
only
silver
bullion
in
exchange
for
goods
thus
undermining
Britainâs
balance
of
payments
Then
at
about
the
turn
of
the
19th
century
wily
foreign
traders
thought
of
an
alternative
medium
of
paymentÂ âÂ opium
Tons
of
the
drug
were
brought
into
China
In
1839
the
Chinese
government
finally
cracked
down
on
this
drain
on
the
treasury
which
was
also
causing
mass
addiction
among
the
Chinese
Some
20,000
chests
of
opium
were
confiscated
from
British
merchants
in
Guangzhou
(Canton)
Retaliation
came
year
later
in
the
first
of
the
Opium
Wars
which
culminated
in
series
of
âunequal
treatiesâ
forced
on
an
increasingly
weak
Manchu
regime
China
was
obliged
to
open
major
ports
to
foreign
political
and
economic
penetration;
Hong
Kong
was
ceded
to
Britain
Infinitely
more
costly
in
human
terms
was
the
Taiping
Rebellion
which
began
in
1850
as
peasant
revolt
There
was
struggle
between
the
Qing
Dynasty
and
rebels
determined
to
overthrow
such
traditional
values
as
respect
for
religion
private
property
and
male
supremacy
The
revolt
lasted
14
years
and
cost
more
lives
than
would
World
War
I
The
Beijing
government
finally
won
but
the
regime
and
the
nation
would
never
be
the
same
This
became
patently
clear
during
the
Sino-Japanese
War
of
1894â1895
in
which
the
inadequacy
of
the
Chinese
army
was
starkly
displayed
Japan
and
Western
powers
were
dismantling
the
Chinese
Empire
Demands
for
reform
won
the
support
of
the
emperor
but
his
notoriously
scheming
aunt
the
Empress
Dowager
Cixi
(Tzâu
Hsi)
edged
him
off
the
throne
Soon
after
Cixi
had
the
chance
to
exploit
the
Boxer
Rebellion
(1900)
revolt
against
foreign
influence
It
was
finally
put
down
by
the
intervention
of
all
the
great
powers
which
joined
together
in
an
unprecedented
alliance
China
was
saddled
with
payment
of
humiliating
indemnity
and
further
loss
of
respect
The
elderly
empress
died
in
1908
one
day
after
the
mysterious
death
of
her
nephew
the
unseated
emperor
The
heir
apparent
was
two-year-old
prince
PuyiÂ âÂ hardly
the
leader
the
dynasty
and
the
nation
needed
in
the
face
of
civil
disorder
and
foreign
threats
Less
than
three
years
later
an
army
uprising
took
place
in
Wuhan
and
quickly
won
widespread
support
The
success
of
the
revolution
surprised
many
observers
It
came
so
suddenly
that
Dr
Sun
Yat-sen
the
inveterate
revolutionary
who
had
led
several
earlier
insurrections
was
still
abroad
at
the
time
He
returned
in
triumph
to
accept
the
presidency
of
the
Chinese
Republic
With
stroke
of
the
brush
the
Manchu
Dynasty
and
its
child-emperor
surrendered
in
1911
The
imperial
tradition
going
back
thousands
of
years
was
snapped
like
twig
Unity
Eludes
the
Chinese
But
the
path
of
the
new
republic
was
strewn
with
dangers
warlord
seized
power
in
Beijing
hoping
to
restore
the
monarchy
harried
Sun
Yat-sen
then
moved
his
new
Kuomintang
party
south
to
Guangzhou
Towards
the
end
of
hostilities
China
entered
World
War
on
the
side
of
the
Allies
But
the
Versailles
Peace
conference
proved
bitter
disappointment
when
Japan
and
not
China
won
control
over
Germanyâs
former
holdings
in
Shandong
Province
Frustration
inspired
protest
demonstrations
The
targets
of
increasing
bitterness
were
the
foreign
powers
and
the
regime
in
Beijing
as
agitation
for
drastic
social
reforms
caught
the
imagination
of
students
and
factory
workers
In
1921
the
Communist
Party
of
China
(with
total
membership
of
53)
held
its
first
national
congress
in
secret
in
Shanghai
cautious
Communist
alliance
was
arranged
with
the
Nationalist
Party
(Guomindang)
in
1924
Disappointed
with
the
Western
powers
Dr
Sun
Yat-sen
turned
for
support
to
the
leaders
of
the
young
Soviet
regime
The
Kremlin
obliged
by
sending
political
and
military
advisors
to
the
Nationalists
In
turn
Dr
Sun
dispatched
his
37-year-old
follower
Chiang
Kai-shek
as
head
of
mission
to
Moscow
Dr
Sun
who
rallied
the
Chinese
with
his
Three
PrinciplesÂ âÂ Nationalism
Democracy
and
the
Peopleâs
LivelihoodÂ âÂ died
in
1925
His
successor
Chiang
Kai-shek
took
over
the
campaign
moving
the
capital
to
Nanjing
In
1927
Chiang
turned
on
the
Communists
as
well
as
on
leftists
within
his
own
party
unleashing
vehement
bloody
purge
The
Communists
who
had
already
organized
the
support
of
millions
of
peasants
gathered
strength
in
the
south
But
facing
increasing
military
pressure
they
set
forth
on
the
epic
Long
March
to
northwest
China
distance
of
some
10,000
perilous
kilometers
(over
6,200
miles)
During
one
of
historyâs
greatest
strategic
retreats
one
of
the
founders
of
the
Chinese
Communist
Party
Mao
Zedong
(Mao
Tse-tung)
was
chosen
as
party
leader
It
was
mandate
he
was
to
retain
for
the
rest
of
his
life
The
Bitter
Years
of
War
In
1931
Japan
seized
Manchuria
proclaiming
it
the
âindependentâ
state
of
Manchukuo
This
was
to
be
fatal
prologue
to
World
War
II
Over
the
next
few
years
Japanese
troops
advanced
into
several
other
areas
of
northern
China
The
government
of
Chiang
Kai-shek
was
so
busy
tracking
down
the
Communists
that
the
Japanese
foe
merited
only
casual
attention
At
one
point
Chiang
himself
was
kidnapped
by
some
of
his
own
officers
sensational
interlude
known
as
the
Sian
(Xiâan)
Incident
Its
aim
was
to
convince
him
to
form
united
front
with
the
Communists
But
by
the
time
concerted
action
could
be
planned
the
invaders
had
moved
onto
broad
offensive
The
Japanese
juggernaut
crushed
all
the
resistance
in
the
big
coastal
cities
as
well
as
in
Beijing
and
Nanjing
The
retreat
ended
in
1938
with
the
Nationalist
government
dug
in
behind
the
gorges
of
the
Yangzi
River
in
the
last-ditch
capital
of
Chongqing
Even
before
entering
World
War
II
the
United
States
was
supporting
the
armies
of
Chiang
Kai-shek
with
food
fuel
and
transport
However
once
in
the
field
the
Americans
soon
became
disheartened
with
the
confusion
corruption
and
stalling
Chiang
they
believed
was
hoarding
everything
from
rice
to
airplanes
in
the
struggle
against
the
Chinese
Communists
and
leaving
the
Allies
to
worry
about
the
Japanese
When
Japan
surrendered
in
1945
Chiang
Kai-shek
could
share
the
victory
toasts
as
one
of
the
Allies
But
he
was
already
losing
the
battle
of
his
lifetimeÂ âÂ for
China
By
V-J
Day
(15
August)
when
Japan
officially
surrendered
the
Chinese
Communists
controlled
an
area
inhabited
by
nearly
one-quarter
of
the
nationâs
population
At
first
the
Americans
tried
to
mediate
between
the
Communists
and
the
Nationalists
even
while
continuing
to
supply
the
Nationalists
But
any
chances
for
postwar
cooperation
between
right
and
left
were
wrecked
in
matter
of
months
China
was
sinking
into
civil
war
Despite
some
early
setbacks
the
Communist
armies
became
an
overwhelming
force
They
were
greeted
as
liberators
by
the
peasants
and
met
only
desultory
resistance
in
most
cities
The
Nationalists
in
despair
fell
back
and
finally
fled
the
country
moving
the
Nationalist
government
and
countless
national
treasures
to
the
island
of
Taiwan
pledging
to
fight
their
way
back
one
day
In

proclaimed
the
âPeopleâs
Republic
of
China.â
After
thousands
of
years
of
empire
and
few
decades
of
violent
transition
the
most
populous
country
in
the
world
was
committed
to
communism
Imposing
the
New
Order
Before
any
grandiose
plans
could
be
implemented
Chinaâs
fledgling
rulers
had
to
rebuild
society
and
crippled
economy
Agrarian
reform
was
the
first
revolutionary
innovation
followed
by
the
organization
of
the
cities
under
Party
control
Hardly
had
the
groundwork
been
laid
when
China
entered
the
Korean
War
sending
âvolunteersâ
to
fight
against
American-led
United
Nations
forces
Relations
between
the
US
and
China
suffered
but
Beijingâs
ties
with
Moscow
prospered
in
comradely
harmony
The
worldâs
first
communist
state
the
USSR
shipped
technical
advisors
and
rubles
to
China
which
patterned
many
new
institutions
on
Soviet
models
As
in
Russia
the
farms
were
collectivized
and
heavy
industry
took
economic
precedence
Mao
Zedongâs
âGreat
Leap
Forwardâ
(1959)
was
designed
to
mobilize
the
masses
in
crash
program
of
economic
growth
but
it
kept
the
country
in
turmoil
and
brought
unconvincing
results
At
about
the
time
the
Leap
was
suddenly
reversed
relations
between
China
and
the
Soviet
Union
plunged
from
polite
to
frosty
to
hostile
China
cut
off
relations
with
the
world
and
tested
its
own
nuclear
bomb
From
1966
to
1976
China
was
convulsed
by
the
Great
Proletarian
Cultural
Revolution
Millions
of
young
Red
Guards
went
on
the
rampage
and
the
whole
country
set
about
memorizing
the
maxims
in
Maoâs
Little
Red
Book
Thousands
perished
and
much
of
Chinaâs
cultural
heritage
was
destroyed
as
vestige
of
feudalism
Changes
came
in
quick
succession
in
the
1970s
The
US
president
Richard
Nixon
visited
China
in
1972
thus
normalizing
relations
between
the
two
countries
In
early
1976
the
widely
admired
prime
minister
Zhou
Enlai
died
Eight
months
later
in
September
death
came
to
Chairman
Mao
himself
Maoâs
widow
the
one-time
film
actress
Jiangqing
and
her
close
associates
(the
so-called
Gang
of
Four)
were
arrested
tried
and
imprisoned
for
encouraging
the
excesses
of
the
Cultural
Revolution
Thousands
who
had
suffered
during
the
fervid
1960s
and
1970s
including
the
forceful
pragmatist
Deng
Xiaoping
were
rehabilitated
At
the
same
time
as
Mao
Zedongâs
portraits
and
slogans
were
being
removed
from
billboards
and
schoolrooms
new
flexibility
was
coming
to
the
fore
Top
priority
was
now
assigned
to
the
modernization
of
Chinaâs
underdeveloped
economy
This
opened
the
way
for
major
scientific
and
commercial
exchanges
with
the
West
And
foreign
tourists
soon
began
flooding
into
the
country
to
see
the
splendors
that
had
been
inaccessible
for
so
long
In
1992
âSupreme
Leaderâ
Deng
Xiaoping
set
into
motion
rapid
Westernization
of
Chinaâs
economy
Dengâs
death
and
Hong
Kongâs
return
to
Chinese
sovereignty
in
1997
together
marked
another
new
era
in
the
creation
of
New
China
this
time
as
an
economic
superpower
designed
to
rival
the
US
and
Europe
in
the
21st
century
In
one
important
respect
however
nothing
has
changed
all
that
much
since
the
time
of
Marco
Polo:
China
is
still
unique
experience
country
like
no
other
Brief
History
The
first
wave
of
California
immigrants
arrived
somewhere
between
20,000
and
35,000
years
agoÂ âÂ wandering
Asiatic
tribes
who
entered
the
American
continent
via
the
Bering
Strait
which
at
that
time
was
dry
land
or
perhaps
covered
in
ice
In
the
succeeding
centuries
their
descendants
continued
to
push
south
and
east
and
eventually
spread
out
to
people
the
whole
of
the
continent
from
Alaska
to
Patagonia
The
tribes
who
decided
to
settle
in
what
is
now
California
were
fortunate
in
their
choice
of
homeland
The
climate
was
very
pleasant
and
food
was
sufficiently
plentiful
for
them
to
avoid
the
constant
warfare
that
plagued
many
tribes
elsewhere
in
the
Americas
The
Indian
tribes
lived
in
harmony
with
nature
Anticipating
1960s
flower
children
seeking
drug-induced
enlightenment
medicine
men
drank
the
juice
of
the
jimson
weed
to
provoke
revelatory
hallucinations
However
not
even
their
wildest
visions
prepared
them
for
the
arrival
of
bearded
men
armed
with
swords
and
crossbows
in
whose
wake
the
Indian
population
plummeted
from
peak
of
275,000
to
mere
16,000
at
the
start
of
the
20th
century
The
Spanish
Missions
The
first
Europeans
landed
on
the
California
coast
in
the
16th
centuryÂ âÂ Spanish
explorers
in
search
of
gold
seeking
to
extend
their
Mexican
empire
northward
In
1542
Juan
RodrÃ­guez
Cabrillo
Portuguese
mariner
in
the
employ
of
the
Viceroy
of
Mexico
landed
at
Point
Loma
at
the
mouth
of
San
Diego
harbor
He
sailed
on
past
the
âBay
of
Smokesâ
(San
Pedro
in
present-day
Los
Angeles)
and
on
through
the
Santa
Barbara
Channel
During
scuffle
with
Native
Americans
he
broke
his
leg
and
contracted
gangrene
which
was
to
prove
fatal
but
his
crew
pushed
on
as
far
as
Oregon
They
found
few
good
harbors
however
and
no
sign
of
gold
and
had
to
return
empty-handed
In
1579
Englandâs
Francis
Drake
during
the
round-the-world
trip
that
earned
him
his
knighthood
took
break
from
harrying
Spanish
treasure
galleons
and
stopped
for
repairs
at
Point
Reyes
(Drakeâs
Bay
just
north
of
San
Francisco)
He
claimed
the
whole
coastal
territory
for
Queen
Elizabeth
I
but
England
was
being
kept
busy
with
other
concerns
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
settle
the
new
territory
In
1769
the
Spanish
began
to
settle
in
California
establishing
string
of
military
garrisons
(presidios)
and
religious
missions
The
first
was
built
in
San
Diego
in
1769
and
then
in
1770
Monterey
was
founded
as
capital
of
Alta
(Upper)
California
The
long
peninsula
of
Baja
(Lower)
California
remained
separate
and
ultimately
became
part
of
Mexico
These
early
missionaries
who
were
led
by
the
Franciscan
friar
JunÃ­pero
Serra
were
all
tough
and
courageous
men
who
faced
hunger
and
hardship
when
their
first
agricultural
efforts
failed
Their
plan
was
to
convert
the
Native
Americans
to
Christianity
teach
them
European
farming
methods
as
well
as
other
skills
and
crafts
and
then
return
the
land
to
them
before
moving
on
to
set
up
another
mission
somewhere
else
The
missionaries
remained
active
well
into
the
19th
century
and
encouraged
Spanish
settlers
by
establishing
Californiaâs
first
towns
the
pueblos
By
1804
they
had
created
chain
of
21
missions
that
stretched
all
the
way
from
San
Diego
north
to
Sonoma
Two
notable
localities
were
first
settled
during
this
period
In
1776
presidio
and
mission
were
built
near
the
mouth
of
the
beautiful
bay
discovered
by
Gaspar
de
PortolÃ¡
in
1769Â âÂ it
was
named
the
MisiÃ³n
San
Francisco
de
AsÃ­s
The
first
two
pueblos
to
be
founded
were
the
Pueblo
de
San
Jose
de
Guadalupe
near
San
Francisco
and
in
the
south
El
Pueblo
de
Nuestra
SeÃ±ora
la
Reina
de
los
Angeles
del
RÃ­o
de
PorciÃºnculaÂ âÂ âThe
Town
of
Our
Lady
the
Queen
of
the
Angels
by
the
River
PorciÃºncula.â
Founded
in
1781
with
total
of
46
inhabitants
most
of
whom
were
Native
Americans
its
name
was
mercifully
shortened
over
time
toÂ âÂ you
guessed
itÂ âÂ Los
Angeles
At
this
time
California
was
not
considered
particularly
attractive
proposition
by
its
Spanish
overlords
Distracted
by
the
Napoleonic
wars
raging
in
Europe
they
finally
abandoned
the
territory
when
Mexico
declared
its
independence
in
1821
The
Mexicans
As
far
as
California
was
concerned
the
Mexican
takeover
was
practically
bloodless
In
fact
Californiaâs
26
years
of
rather
loose
Mexican
administration
(1822â1848)
were
characterized
by
series
of
bloodless
revolutions
The
governorship
at
Monterey
changed
hands
11
times
in
period
of
five
years
not
counting
three
governors
whom
Mexico
City
had
dared
to
impose
and
whose
authority
was
then
completely
ignored
There
was
some
half-hearted
fighting
between
northerners
and
southerners
for
control
of
the
property
and
lands
left
by
the
Spanish
missionaries
half
of
which
was
meant
to
be
returned
to
the
Native
Americans
but
never
was
California
grew
into
territory
with
just
one
industryÂ âÂ cattle
ranching
for
the
sale
of
cowhide
and
tallow
In
the
meantime
the
old
crafts
were
abandoned
and
California
started
to
earn
reputation
as
place
of
leisure
The
American
Pioneers
The
first
Americans
to
come
to
California
from
the
eastern
states
were
Boston
fur
traders
taking
the
Cape
Horn
route
at
the
end
of
the
18th
century
They
didnât
stay
for
long
but
gradually
other
traders
and
fur
trappers
began
to
arrive
overland
through
Utah
Nevada
Arizona
and
New
Mexico
settling
only
in
small
numbers
until
the
famous
covered
wagons
began
their
heroic
treks
of
the
1840s
The
hardships
the
pioneers
suffered
in
the
Sierra
Nevada
mountains
Death
Valley
and
the
Mojave
Desert
became
the
stuff
of
California
legend
the
most
tragic
being
the
fate
of
87
pioneers
who
set
out
from
Illinois
in
1846
While
attempting
to
cross
the
Sierra
Nevada
George
Donnerâs
wagon
train
became
snowed
in
and
from
November
until
February
was
stuck
high
in
the
mountains
north
of
Lake
Tahoe
at
point
now
known
as
the
Donner
Pass
Just
47
people
survived
and
then
only
by
resorting
to
cannibalism
Just
simple
farmers
seeking
place
in
the
sun
to
work
piece
of
land
the
pioneers
came
at
time
when
territorial
expansion
was
much
in
vogueÂ âÂ the
French
in
the
Pacific
and
Algeria
the
British
in
Africa
and
the
Far
East
The
United
States
was
eager
to
get
in
on
the
act
and
so
during
the
war
with
Mexico
over
the
annexation
of
Texas
California
was
suddenly
regarded
as
useful
addition
to
the
spoils
United
States
forces
captured
Los
Angeles
in
1847
and
the
Mexicans
capitulated
at
Cahuenga
treaty
of
American
annexation
of
California
was
signed
on
February
1848
Meanwhile
unknown
to
the
American
and
Mexican
signatories
gold
had
been
found
in
the
Sierra
Nevada
foothills
only
nine
days
earlier
The
Gold
Rush
The
find
that
caught
the
whole
worldâs
imagination
was
made
by
one
James
Wilson
Marshall
carpenter
at
John
Sutterâs
sawmill
on
the
American
River
at
Coloma
which
lies
midway
between
Sacramento
and
Lake
Tahoe
He
had
found
flakes
of
23-carat
gold
in
the
river
gravel
and
in
the
following
year
alone
6,000
prospectors
poured
in
from
Hawaii
Oregon
Utah
Mexico
Peru
and
Chile
and
proceeded
to
dig
up
$10
million
worth
of
the
precious
metal
In
1849
the
Gold
Rush
really
began
with
40,000
fortune
hunters
from
all
parts
of
North
and
South
America
scrabbling
for
the
$30
million
worth
of
gold
By
1852
at
the
peak
of
the
mining
boom
there
were
over
100,000
prospectors
in
the
region
all
fiercely
individualistic
working
away
at
their
personal
private
stakes
rather
than
banding
together
in
organized
syndicates
There
was
also
another
fortune
to
be
madeÂ âÂ this
time
from
the
service
industriesÂ âÂ and
San
Francisco
home
of
the
banks
and
manufacturers
of
mining
equipment
began
to
grow
into
metropolis
All
kinds
of
con-men
and
hustlers
flocked
in
to
part
the
diggers
from
their
gold
dust
One
of
the
more
enduring
spin-offs
of
the
Gold
Rush
was
the
hard-wearing
work
trousers
sold
by
the
Bavarian
immigrant
and
entrepreneur
Levi
Strauss
Originally
made
from
tent
canvas
and
later
from
the
twill-weave
cotton
known
as
denim
Leviâs
jeans
are
now
world
famous
Lured
by
the
promise
of
increased
federal
revenues
from
the
newly
discovered
gold
the
United
States
Congress
admitted
California
as
the
31st
state
of
the
Union
in
1850
Statehood
The
early
years
of
statehood
were
marked
by
rough-and-ready
kind
of
justice
In
the
absence
of
well-established
judiciary
or
organized
police
force
law
and
order
was
enforced
by
vigilantes
and
summary
hanging
was
the
usual
sentence
The
Chinese
arrived
in
the
wake
of
the
great
Taiping
Rebellion
of
1851
seeking
security
and
prosperity
in
what
they
were
told
were
Californiaâs
âGolden
Mountains.â
They
suffered
both
exploitation
by
Chinese
entrepreneurs
who
used
them
as
indentured
labor
and
discriminatory
taxation
by
the
state
legislature
The
worst-treated
however
were
the
Native
Americans
whose
numbers
dwindled
rapidly
not
only
as
result
of
disease
and
malnutrition
but
also
because
of
systematic
massacres
in
the
1850s
by
Californian
militia
In
1859
the
discovery
of
silver
(the
Comstock
Lode
in
western
Nevada)
caused
Silver
Rush
in
the
reverse
direction
with
the
mining
being
organized
almost
completely
from
California
As
the
stateâs
economy
expanded
its
major
priority
became
transcontinental
railway
to
connect
it
to
the
eastern
markets
Engineer
Theodore
Judah
defied
all
the
experts
by
plotting
railway
link
between
Sacramento
and
the
East
passing
right
through
the
heart
of
the
Sierra
Nevada
and
the
Rocky
mountains
He
managed
to
sell
his
idea
to
San
Francisco
consortium
that
became
known
as
the
Central
Pacificâs
âBig
FourâÂ âÂ Mark
Hopkins
Collis
Huntington
Charles
Crocker
and
Leland
Stanford
names
that
continue
to
echo
in
both
the
streets
and
institutions
of
present-day
California
The
railroad
project
transformed
the
Big
Fourâs
personal
assets
of
$100,000
in
1861
into
fortune
of
$200
million
The
line
which
linked
up
with
the
Union
Pacific
at
Promontory
Utah
in
1869
was
built
under
the
most
hazardous
conditions
using
poorly
paid
Chinese
laborers
who
sometimes
worked
suspended
in
wicker
baskets
over
sheer
cliffs
to
hack
tenuous
cutting
through
the
steep
passes
of
the
Sierras
The
Great
Earthquake
The
more
devout
Californians
were
convinced
God
was
punishing
San
Francisco
for
its
gold
lust
and
sinfulness
when
an
earthquake
registering
8.25
on
the
Richter
Scale
struck
the
city
at
5:13am
on
18
April
1906
The
initial
quake
wiped
out
about
5,000
buildings
but
the
great
fire
that
followed
destroyed
most
of
the
city
With
the
water
mains
shattered
the
City
Fire
Department
could
do
nothing
to
stop
the
fire
from
spreading
out
of
control
The
earthquake
and
fire
together
caused
452
deaths
according
to
official
estimates
but
the
imposition
of
martial
law
by
Mayor
Schmitz
(without
authorization)
resulted
in
up
to
100
more
dead
in
summary
executions
for
looting
or
refusing
to
help
the
firefighters
The
performance
of
the
military
was
less
than
exemplaryÂ âÂ as
Chinatown
burned
it
was
looted
by
the
National
Guardsmen
sent
to
protect
it
Reform
Progress
and
Oil
The
San
Francisco
earthquake
helped
to
focus
the
nationâs
attention
on
the
graft
and
corruption
that
ran
right
through
the
heart
of
California
society
The
federal
prosecution
succeeded
in
jailing
only
handful
of
the
principals
involved
but
the
publicity
was
enough
to
make
the
concept
of
âreformâ
popular
one
The
reform
movement
intent
on
breaking
the
political
power
of
the
big
corporations
attacked
corrupt
practices
in
administration
public
finances
and
banking
but
did
nothing
to
oppose
the
businessmenâs
traditional
resistance
to
unions
and
more
liberal
labor
laws
There
was
also
campaign
of
official
discrimination
against
Chinese
and
Japanese
immigrants
excluding
them
from
owning
land
and
preventing
further
immigration
All
kinds
of
produce
grew
large
and
lush
in
Californiaâs
fertile
irrigated
soil
but
the
most
financially
profitable
thing
to
come
out
of
the
Californian
earth
was
oil
Drilling
had
begun
in
the
1860s
but
didnât
take
off
until
1892
By
the
1920s
the
derricks
of
the
Standard
Union
and
Shell
oil
companies
had
sprouted
all
over
the
Los
Angeles
basin
In
that
one
decade
the
stateâs
oil
revenues
were
$2.5
billion
$500
million
more
than
all
the
gold
the
Sierras
yielded
in
century
Sunny
oil-rich
Los
Angeles
was
therefore
the
perfect
place
for
the
car
to
emerge
as
an
everyday
household

From
1920
to
1930
L.A.âs
population
more
than
doubled
and
the
number
of
private
cars
increased
fivefold
Noting
the
central
position
of
the
âpursuit
of
happinessâ
in
Americaâs
Declaration
of
Independence
the
Los
Angeles
Times
asked
in
1926:
âHow
can
one
pursue
happiness
by
any
swifter
and
surer
means
than
by
the
use
of
the
automobile?â
Hollywood
If
you
didnât
feel
like
pursuing
happiness
in
car
you
could
sit
in
the
dark
and
dream
about
it
in
the
cinema
instead
The
booming
popularity
of
this
new
entertainment
form
meant
that
the
film
production
companies
based
originally
in
the
East
had
to
find
place
where
they
could
shoot
outdoors
for
52
weeks
year
They
finally
settled
in
suburb
of
Los
Angeles
Hollywood
where
there
was
guaranteed
sunshine
all
the
year
round
plusÂ âÂ within
easy
reach
of
the
new
studiosÂ âÂ deserts
and
mountains
as
well
as
beaches
rivers
forests
and
islands
which
could
double
for
the
Wild
West
the
Holy
Land
the
MediterraneanÂ âÂ wherever
Hollywood
soon
became
mecca
for
dreamers
Somewhat
dubious
âtalent
schoolsâ
sprang
up
catering
to
small-town
girls
who
hoped
to
emulate
film
stars
such
as
Mary
Pickford
If
they
didnât
make
it
as
actresses
the
âschoolsâ
turned
them
into
call
girls
for
the
producers
and
in
1922
the
lurid
rape
trial
of
comic
Fatty
Arbuckle
highlighted
Hollywoodâs
decadent
lifestyle
of
fast
cars
bootleg
whisky
and
drugs
The
immediate
reaction
was
the
imposition
of
the
Hays
Office
code
of
morals
which
decreed
that
in
all
Hollywood
films
sin
must
be
punishedÂ âÂ it
could
be
shown
in
detail
but
it
must
always
be
punished
The
industry
cashed
in
on
the
boom
years
of
the
1920s
Hollywood
Boulevard
introduced
lavishly
exotic
Chinese
and
Egyptian-style
movie
palaces
and
film
stars
built
homes
to
match
in
Beverly
Hills
the
most
famous
being
the
Pickfair
mansion
hunting
lodge
which
Douglas
Fairbanks
and
Mary
Pickford
turned
into
honeymoon
estate
However
in
spite
of
the
glamour
Hollywoodâs
rather
seedy
image
persisted
Boarding
houses
in
Los
Angeles
sometimes
advertised
âRooms
for
rentÂ âÂ no
dogs
or
actors
allowed.â
Depression
and
Boom
The
Great
Depression
hit
California
hard
Income
from
agriculture
dropped
by
50
percent
between
1929
and
1932
and
one-fifth
of
the
stateâs
population
was
on
public
relief
California
managed
to
weather
the
downturn
better
than
the
rest
of
the
country
however
and
became
magnet
for
dispossessed
refugees
from
the
Dustbowl
of
the
Midwest
âOkies,â
as
they
were
known
packed
their
families
and
belongings
into
rickety
cars
and
trucks
to
make
the
epic
voyage
west
to
find
work
in
the
farms
and
orchards
of
California
Their
tale
of
hardship
pride
bitterness
and
exploitation
is
graphically
recorded
in
the
Pulitzer
Prizeâwinning
novel
The
Grapes
of
Wrath
by
California
writer
John
Steinbeck
Then
came
World
War
II
bringing
with
it
an
enormous
boom
for
the
stateâs
beleaguered
economy
with
the
United
States
federal
government
spending
$35
billion
in
California
Overnight
ships
and
planes
became
the
stateâs
most
important
products
Manufacturers
such
as
Douglas
Lockheed
and
Northrop
were
all
located
in
the
Los
Angeles
area
In
the
post-war
period
California
continued
to
prosper
Agriculture
grew
up
into
agribusiness;
the
film
industry
expanded
into
the
new
field
of
television;
the
aircraft
industry
was
boosted
by
the
space
program;
and
semiconductor
technology
paved
the
way
for
Silicon
Valley
Beatniks
Hippies
and
Modern
Times
True
to
the
tradition
of
Californiaâs
indulgence
of
utopian
dreams
the
Beat
generation
of
the
1950s
made
its
home
in
San
Franciscoâs
North
Beach
district
Writers
such
as
Jack
Kerouac
and
Allen
Ginsberg
as
well
as
the
poets
that
hung
round
Lawrence
Ferlinghettiâs
City
Lights
Bookstore
advocated
free
and
unstructured
style
of
writing
exemplified
by
Jack
Kerouacâs
cult
novel
On
the
Road
Ten
years
on
the
term
âhippiesâ
was
coined
for
the
flower
children
who
gathered
around
the
Haight-Ashbury
district
of
San
Francisco
These
inhabitants
of
what
Joan
Didion
was
to
call
âAmericaâs
first
teenage
slumâ
dispensed
vision
of
love
peace
and
light
heavily
laced
with
marijuana
and
more
dangerous
drugs
such
as
LSD
The
sixties
also
produced
distinctive
brand
of
rock
music
with
bands
such
as
the
Grateful
Dead
and
Jefferson
Airplane
and
the
legendary
voice
of
Janis
Joplin
California
was
also
in
the
forefront
of
student
radicalism
beginning
with
the
Free
Speech
Movement
at
Berkeley
in
1964
and
ending
with
the
violent
clashes
at
San
Francisco
State
University
in
1968
and
the
1969
Berkeley
demonstration
in
favor
of
âPeopleâs
Park,â
when
protesters
were
sprayed
with
tear
gas
Black
radicalism
accelerated
after
the
Watts
riots
in
Los
Angeles
in
1965
and
reached
its
peak
with
the
Black
Panthers
in
Oakland
paramilitary
organization
led
by
Huey
Newton
Eldridge
Cleaver
and
Bobby
Seale
The
Watts
riots
were
sinisterly
echoed
in
the
Los
Angeles
riots
of
1992
when
the
same
area
of
South-Central
L.A
was
ravaged
by
violence
in
response
to
the
acquittal
of
white
police
officers
who
were
captured

Americaâs
continuous
social
revolution
has
always
had
prominent
place
in
California
life
Pressures
for
some
kind
of
change
have
been
alternately
encouraged
and
resisted
as
the
stateâs
volatile
political
establishment
has
swung
back
and
forth
between
conservatives
and
progressives
Ronald
Reagan
staunch
Republican
and
former
Hollywood
actor
served
as
governor
of
California
between
1966
and
1974
and
as
president
of
the
United
States
from
1980
to
1988
He
was
succeeded
as
governor
of
California
by
Jerry
Brown
known
to
many
as
âGovernor
Moonbeam.â
left-wing
Democrat
who
espoused
Zen
Buddhism
and
the
legalization
of
marijuana
he
also
imposed
environmental
protection
measures
and
energy
resources
long
before
others
began
to
see
the
wisdom
of
such
policies
In
his
current
incarnation
Brown
is
the
mayor
of
Oakland
California
Recent
earthquakesÂ âÂ one
in
San
Francisco
in
1989
and
another
that
hit
Los
Angeles
in
1994Â âÂ have
served
as
reminders
that
Californians
continue
to
live
in
the
shadow
of
The
Big
OneÂ âÂ the
major
earthquake
that
experts
predict
will
strike
in
the
next
30
years
It
says
lot
for
the
attractions
of
life
in
CaliforniaÂ âÂ and
the
optimism
of
those
who
continue
to
enjoy
itÂ âÂ that
despite
this
dire
prediction
millions
of
people
still
seek
their
future
in
the
Golden
Stateâs
promised
land
WhERE

GO
he
grey-green
Danube
cuts
straight
through
the
heart
of
the
cityÂ âÂ neatly
separating
the
ancient
cobblestone
streets
of
Buda
from
the
late-19th-century
boulevards
of
Pest
If
you
love
history
youâll
probably
head
for
the
Buda
side
of
the
river
but
if
youâre
keen
shopper
and
enjoy
lively
nightlife
then
Pest
will
certainly
oblige
Orientation
is
rarely
problem
as
the
majority
of
sights
are
crammed
into
the
central
areas
and
getting
around
the
city
is
very
easy
Castle
Hill
is
made
for
walking
and
the
rest
of
town
is
efï¬ciently
served
by
buses
trams
trolleybuses
and
underground
trains
This
section
follows
the
natural
layout
of
the
city
starting
on
the
western
bank
with
Buda
Obuda
and
the
hills
and
then
moves
across
the
Danube
stopping
at
Margaret
Island
and
over
to
Pest
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
It
is
perhaps
best
to
sample
Budapest
piecemeal:
taking
little
from
one
side
then
crossing
over
the
river
to
the
other
and
heading
back
again
However
most
would
agree
that
the
best
place
to
start
is
the
Castle
Hill
Castle
Hill
(Varhegy)
This
fascinating
area
is
the
most
picturesque
and
peaceful
spot
in
Budapest
giving
the
only
clue
as
to
how
the
medieval
city
once
looked
Entire
streets
of
beautiful
old
buildings
are
concentrated
here
and
almost
every
other
house
bears
muemlÃ©k
(monument)
plaque
which
tells
of
its
history
As
serene
as
it
seems
today
however
the
district
has
suffered
destruction
upon
destruction
in
the
past
and
many
places
have
been
rebuilt
at
least
once
The
area
overlooks
the
city
from
long
narrow
plateau
divided
into
two:
the
southern
part
occupied
by
the
enormous
Royal
Palace
where
the
original
castle
once
stood
and
the
northern
district
of
historic
streets
where
14th-
and
15th-century
aristocrats
and
artisans
once
rubbed
shoulders
From
Pest
there
are
various
ways
of
getting
up
to
Castle
Hill
The
most
popular
method
of
ascent
is
aboard
the
19th-century
siklÃ³
(funicular)
which
starts
by
the
end
of
the
Chain
Bridge
and
rises
to
the
Royal
Palace
Alternatively
take
the
metro
to
Moszkva
tÃ©r
climb
up
the
steps
to
the
road
and
catch
the
mini
VÃ¡rbusz
service
which
shuttles
to
and
from
DÃ­sz
tÃ©r
stopping
at
numerous
points
en
route
You
could
simply
walk
up
the
hill
using
any
one
of
several
streets
and
staircases
but
one
method
you
cannot
use
is
your
own
transport;
cars
are
forbidden
on
the
hill
(unless
you
are
resident
or
guest
at
the
Hilton
Hotel)
thus
preserving
the
areaâs
historic
ambience

right
at
the

terminus
short
walk
brings
you
to
DÃ­sz

(Parade
Square)
which
marks
the
start
of
the
northern
district
The
MÃ¡tyÃ¡s
templom
(Matthias
Church)
spire
towering
gracefully
over
this
historic
area
is
the
best
reference
point
for
our
tour
The
church
takes
its
name
from
Hungaryâs
favourite
medieval
king
who
married
here
twice
in
the
15th
century
The
Emperor
Franz
Joseph
was
crowned
king
of
Hungary
here
in
1867
to
the
tune
of
the
Coronation
Mass
composed
by
Liszt
for
the
occasion
The
original
church
was
built
in
the
mid-13th
century
converted
into
mosque
during
the
Turkish
occupation
and
seriously
damaged
during
Budaâs
recapture
in
1686
It
was
rebuilt
in
Baroque
style
after
the
return
of
the
Christian
forces
and
between
1873
and
1896
it
was
completely
reconstructed
along
its
present
Neo-Gothic
lines
The
unusual
multi-coloured
diamond-pattern
roof
and
geometric
designs
covering
the
inside
walls
date
back
to
the
19th-century
refurbishing;
the
motifs
are
therefore
Hungarian
and
not
Turkish
Tour
guides
are
quick
to
point
out
the
Loreto
Chapel
(immediately
to
the
left
of
the
entrance)
where
red
marble
statue
of
the
Virgin
takes
pride
of
place
At
the
east
end
of
the
church
is
the
entrance
to
the
crypt
and
the
museum
which
holds
ï¬ne
collection
of
medieval
stone
carvings
sacred
relics
historic
vestments
and
religious
paintings
The
museum
rambles
up
and
down
old
staircases
around
the
church
offering
at
one
spot
an
excellent
view
down
onto
the
nave
Outside
the
front
of
the
church
in
the
centre
of
Szent-hÃ¡romsÃ¡g
tÃ©r
(Trinity
Square)
is
votive
column
crowded
with
statues
of
saints
and
angels
which
recalls
bubonic
plague
epidemic
of
the
early
18th
century
The
survivors
built
the
monument
in
gratitude
for
being
spared
Behind
the
column
there
is
ï¬ne
Neo-Gothic
building
that
puts
on
temporary
exhibitions
and
also
offers
accommodation
Looking
across
the
square
towards
DÃ­sz
tÃ©r
the
Baroque
two-storey
white
building
with
jutting
corner
balcony
served
as
the
former
Buda
town
hall
from
1710
to
1873
Behind
the
church
is
the
most
photographed
monument
in
Budapest
the
intriguingly-named
HalÃ¡szbÃ¡stya
(Fishermenâs
Bastion)
Built
onto
the
castle
walls
at
ï¬rst
glance
this
picture-book
array
of
turrets
terraces
and
arches
could
easily
pass
for
authentic
medieval
fortiï¬cations
but
they
are
in
fact
too
good
to
be
true
constructed
around
the
turn
of
this
century
as
pure
ornamentation
The
name
refers
to
the
ï¬shermen
who
defended
the
ramparts
here
in
the
18th
century
Today
it

has
integrated

with
the
remains
of

was
rebuilt
but
the
remainder
of
the
church
was
left
levelled
as
poignant
reminder
of
events
An
altogether
more
light-hearted
curiosity
can
be
seen
on
the
corner
of
OrszÃ¡ghÃ¡z
utca
and
Petermann
bÃ­rÃ³
utca
âï¬ying
nunâ
in
stone
(a
reference
to
convent
that
occupied
number
28
before
Parliament)
has
apparently
passed
straight
through
the
corner
of
the
building
MiklÃ³s
Melocco
executed
this
amusing
sculpture
in
1977
Uri
utca
meaning
gentlemenâs
street
is
even
older
than
OrszÃ¡ghÃ¡z
utca
and
the
details
on
many
of
its
houses
are
equally
fascinating
Yet
another
specialist
museum
crops
up
at
number
49;
the
Telephone
Museum
features
110
years
of
telephone
exchanges
and
technology
Budapest
had
the
first
telephone
exchange
At
number
you
can
descend
deep
into
the
hill
via
series
of
tunnels
that
were
dug
in
medieval
times
as
an
escape
route
in
times
of
siege
They
were
used
again
as
air-raid
shelters
and
an
emergency
hospital
in
1944â1945
Here
visitors
can
join
guided
tour
of
the
caves
and

which
also
contain

depicting
episodes
of

Uri
utca
terminates
at
DÃ­sz
tÃ©r
where
itâs
best
to
turn
and
walk
back
along
TÃ¡rnok
utca
Among
the
shops
and
restaurants
here
are
number
of
ï¬ne
buildings
The
orange-and-red
geometric
frescoes
painted
on
the
overhanging
ï¬rst
ï¬oor
of
the
AranyhordÃ³
(Golden
Barrel)
restaurant
are
the
most
noteworthy
Next
door
number
18
was
built
as
merchantâs
house
in
the
ï¬rst
half
of
the
15th
century
Used
as
the
Arany
Sas
(Golden
Eagle)
pharmacy
from
1750
until
1913
it
is
now
the
most
attractive
of
this
areaâs
small
museums
Beautiful
old
majolica
vessels
are
the
stars
of
an
atmospheric
re-creation
of
the
pharmacy
and
there
are
also
informative
displays
on
potions
practices
and
alchemy
in
the
Budapest
of
this
era
The
ï¬nal
street
of
this
district
to
be
explored
is
the
leafy
TÃ³th
ArpÃ¡d
sÃ©tÃ¡ny
This
promenade
situated
along
the
western
ramparts
offers
views
of
the
Buda
Hills
and
the
huge
Southern
Railway
Station
(DÃ©li
pÃ¡lyaudavar)
rather
than
glorious
Danube
panorama
Nonetheless
this
is
delightful
stroll
particularly
in
early
evening
when
the
locals
come
out
to
enjoy
the
fresh
air
At
the
northern
end
various
cannon
signal
the
entrance
to
the
Museum
of
Military
History
(HadtÃ¶rtÃ©neti
MÃºzeum)
Itâs
an
extensive
exhibition
and
popular
with
school-children
but
the
section
dedicated
to
the
1956
uprising
is
the
most
memorable
for
older
visitors
The
Royal
Palace
Now
returned
to
its
former
outward
splendour
the
Royal
Palace
dominates
Castle
Hillâs
southern
skyline
Construction
began
in
the
13th
century
and
reached
its
zenith
in
the
15th
century
under
King
MÃ¡tyÃ¡s
when
the
palace
was
said
to
be
equal
in
grandeur
to
that
of
any
in
Europe
Under
the
Ottoman
empire
however
it
was
neglected
and
during
the
siege
of
1686
was
destroyed
In
the
following
two
centuries
the
palace
was
rebuilt
in
the
Neo-Baroque
style
Nemesis
was
on
hand
again
when
the
German
occupation
forces
made
this
their
headquarters
during
ï¬nal
stand
in
1945
Since
then
the
palace
has
been
rebuilt
purely
to
house
three
museums
and
library
Itâs
huge
place
and
canât
be
covered
in
one
day
Break
up
your
time
here
with
sightseeing
on
the
northern
part
of
the
hill
If
you
are
not
already
on
Castle
Hill
then
the
best
approach
to
the
Royal
Palace
is
from
the
steps
at
the
southern
tip
of
the
hill
by
the
Semmelweis
Medical
Museum
The
path
winds
up
through
lovely
gardens
to
the
rear
entrance
of
the
castle
and
the
only
surviving
turreted
tower
the
BuzogÃ¡ny
(mace)
Tower
Steps
lead
up
through
tiny
castle
gardens
to
the
entrance
of
the
Museum
of
Budapest
History
(Budapesti
TÃ¶rtÃ©neti
MÃºzeum)
in
wing
of
the
Royal
Palace
More
than
40
years
of
excavations
at
the
palace
site
have
produced
picture
of
the
medieval
Royal
Palace
of
King
MÃ¡tyÃ¡s;
it
is
possible
to
visit
the
ten
or
so
rooms
that
have
survived
from
the
original
now
reconstructed
in
their
former
state
Make
sure
you
see
the
exhibition
of
Gothic
statues
from
the
Royal
Palace
During
construction
work
at
the
start
of
the
15th
century
the
statues
were
thrown
out
in
the
yard
which
was
later
filled
in
and
they
remained
there
until
excavated
in
1974
The
southern
palace
courtyard
includes
wing
F
which
houses
the
National
Library
and
its
two
million
books
The
library
is
open
to
the

are
held
in
the

Through
the

arch
is
the
main

The

and
house
the
Hungarian
National
Gallery
(Magyar
Nemzeti
GalÃ©ria)Â âÂ a
huge
undertaking
spanning
seven
centuries
of
Hungarian
art
Donât
try
to
see
it
all
in
one
visitÂ âÂ there
are
some
ï¬ne
works
here
but
it
is
too
much
for
one
day
The
galleryâs
most
popular
sections
are
Hungarian
Impressionism
and
20th
century
works
(in
Wings
and

Contemporary

lovers
are
advised
to
head
straight
for
the
Ludwig
Collection
in

A
which
includes
important
figures
in
the
contemporary
art
world
featuring
several
controversial
works
Obuda
Historically
Obuda
is
the
oldest
quarter
of
Buda
centred
on
the
site
of
Aquincum
the
capital
of
the
Roman
province
of
Lower
Pannonia
Nowadays
itâs
nightmare
of
Soviet
town-planning
with
heavy
trafï¬c
constantly
rumbling
past
on
the
main
northern
highway
out
of
Budapest
Amid
this
unlikely
setting
however
there
are
some
major
Roman
remains
to
be
discovered
To
begin
the
Roman
route
take
any
number
of
city
buses
north
to
the
so-called
Military
Amphitheatre
(Katonai
Amï¬teÃ¡trum)
thus
distinguishing
it
from
smaller
one
short
distance
farther
north
Gladiators
performed
here
in
the
second
century
to
amuse
legionnaires
Completely
forgotten
for
centuries
the
ruins
were
only
partially
restored
in
the
1930s
Now
itâs
effectively
grassy
piece
of
parkland
where
locals
play
and
walk
their
dogs
but
enough
remains
of
the
amphitheatre
walls
and
outline
to
give
good
idea
of
what
it
was
once
like
Farther
north
beneath
the
FlÃ³riÃ¡n
tÃ©r
ï¬yover
on
the
Buda
side
of
the
ArpÃ¡d
Bridge
stand
the
ruins
of
baths
built
for
the
Roman
legions
Take
the
walkway
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
ï¬yover
from
the
baths
and
you
will
catch
the
incongruous
sight
of
dozen
isolated
Corinthian
columns
with
1960s
housing
estate
backdrop
The
third
and
most
important
site
is
that
of
Aquincum
civil
town
for
the
artisans
merchants
priests
and
other
non-military
staff
attached
to
the
legion
You
can
get
here
by
bus
tram
or
HEV
train
Keep
your
eyes
on
the
highway
central
reservation
shortly
before
the
Aquincum
stop
and
you
will
see
the
remains
of
Roman
aqueduct
The
site
proper
which
covers
several
acres
comprises
the
foundations
of
villas
(including
some
ï¬oor
mosaics)
workshops
and
public
areas
and
there
is
another
amphitheatre
ruin
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
You
will
need
more
than
little
imagination
to
re-enact
the
scene
of
1,600â1,700
years
ago
from
the
knee-high
rubble
but
you
will
ï¬nd
help
in
the
small
museum
attached
to
the
site
Here
the
best
of
the
ï¬nds
are
displayed
here
and
at
the
entrance
kiosk
there
are
guide-books
in
various
languages
If
you
want
to
explore
the
Roman
connection
farther
enquire
at
Aquincum
about
access
to
the
Hercules
Villa
museum
at
Meggyfa
utca
21
But
there
is
more
to
Obuda
than
its
Roman
heritage
Between
FlÃ³riÃ¡n
tÃ©r
and
the
river
is
FotÃ©r
small
picturesque
cobbled
square
untouched
by
modern
development
In
this
oasis
you
will
ï¬nd
fine
old
theatre
several
pleasant
cafÃ©s
four
ï¬rst-class
restaurants
and
just
off
the
square
two
excellent
small
museum-galleries
Even
before
you
reach
the
Imre
Varga
Museum
(at
Laktanya
utca
7)
youâll
half
know
what
to
expect
because
of
the
charming
ï¬gures
with
umbrellas
standing
by
the
square
Varga
is
renowned
as
Hungaryâs
greatest
living
sculptor;
whether
his
materials
and
subject
matter
are
conventional
(as
is
the
case
with
âUmbrellasâ)
or
offbeat
as
many
of
his
works
are
he
manages
to
be
accessible
and
very
likeable
The
Vasarely
Museum
on
SzentlÃ©lek

features
ï¬rst-class
Op

Buda
Riverside
and
Hills
The
stretch
of
riverside
which
is
of
most
interest
to
visitors
runs
north
from
SzabadsÃ¡g
hÃ­d
(Liberty
Bridge)
While
Castle
Hill
provides
arguably
the
ï¬nest
views
over
the
Danube
there
is
another
lookout
point
that
also
should
not
be
missed
GellÃ©rt-hegy
(GellÃ©rt
Hill)
which
rises
some
140
metres
(430
feet)
almost
directly
above
the
Danube
on
the
Buda
side
provides
marvellous
panorama
Itâs
not
well
served
by
public
transport
so
give
your
legs
some
exercise
starting
from
the
southern
approach
by
the
GellÃ©rt
Hotel
Almost
immediately
to
your
right
you
will
see
an
extraordinary
monument
in
the
hillside
cave
converted
into
chapel
It
belongs
to
the
Order
of
St
Paul
the
only
monastic
body
of
Hungarian
origin
Continue
up
the
slope
through
the
pleasant
landscaped
gardens
of
the
Jubileumi
Park
turn
right
onto
the
main
road
and
you
will
soon
reach
the
summit
The
Citadel
crowning
the
hill
was
built
by
the
Habsburgs
after
the
Revolution
of
1848
as
lookout
point
from
which
to
control
neighbouring
Castle
Hill
It
saw
no
action
however
until
the
end
of
World
War
II
when
the
German
army
held
out
here
Since
then
the
Citadel
has
been
renovated
and
now
holds
restaurant
cafÃ©
and
budget
hotel
Liberation
Monument
(Szabadsag
szobor)
visible
from
all
parts
of
the
city
stands
below
the
citadel
It
was
erected
by
the
Russians
in
honour
of
their
troops
who
fell
while
âliberatingâ
Budapest
from
the
Germans
The
monument
is
loathed
by
most
locals
as
symbol
of
Soviet
domination
but
it
has
become
too
much
of
city
landmark
to
remove
Down
at
the
base
of
the
hill
the
GellÃ©rt
Hotel
is
the
perfect
place
to
recover
from
your
walk
Behind
this
classic
1918
white
Art
Nouveau
structure
is
swimming
pool
complex
and
the
ï¬nest
thermal
bath
in
Buda
While
the
older
family
members
may
wish
to
enjoy
the
restorative
thermal
waters
and
float
at
leisure
in
the
beautiful
indoor
pool
youngsters
will
most
likely
delight
in
the
equally
splendid
landscaped
outdoor
pool
There
are
some
more
baths
(fÃ¼rdo)
with
wonderful
atmosphere
in
which
to
relax
just
along
the
Buda
embankment
(rakpart)
by
the
entrance
to
the
ErzsÃ©bet
hÃ­d
(Elizabeth
Bridge)
The
thermal
pools
are
restricted
to
men
only
The
entrance
to
the
Rudas
fÃ¼rdo
is
rather
shabby
and
knowledge
of
the
language
is
deï¬nitely
an
advantage
here
but
after
400
years
of
serving
the
locals
change
comes
slowly
The
building
has
been
much
altered
over
the
centuries
but
the
atmosphere
in
the
steamy
main
pool
where
stone
Turkish
dome
rises
over
an
octagonal
pool
and
sunbeams
stream
in
through
the
star-shaped
glass
openings
in
the
cupola
is
magically
ancient
The
medicinal
theme
continues
little
farther
north
at
the
Semmelweis
Museum
of
the
History
of
Medicine
(Semmelweis
OrvostÃ¶rtÃ©neti
MÃºzeum)
Professor
Semmelweis
who
was
born
here
in
1815
discovered
the
cause
of
puerperal
fever
and
thus
became
known
as
the
âSaviour
of
Mothers.â
The
museum
is
lively
sometimes
gruesome
trawl
through
old
instruments
and
techniques
some
of
which
appear
far
worse
than
the
condition
they
were
intended
to
relieve
There
is
also
beautifully
preserved
old
pharmacy
shop
dating
back
to
1813
North
of
the
museum
the
embankment
is
relieved
by
arcades
terraces
Neo-Classical
statues
ceremonial
staircases
and
gateways
(not
open
to
the
public)
which
lead
up
to
the
Royal
Palace
At
this
point
itâs
best
to
catch
bus
or
tram
along
the
main
road
Fo
utca
which
becomes
canyon
of
trafï¬c
noise
pollution
and
exhaust
fumes
Get
off
at
the
stop
before
BatthyÃ¡ny
tÃ©r
to
admire
the
colourful
exterior
of
the
1896
Neo-Gothic
Calvinist
Church
which
features
in
so
many
panoramas
of
the
city
BatthyÃ¡ny
tÃ©r
is
major
square
where
metro
bus
tram
and
suburban
railway
all
meet
It
is
bright
lively
area
and
offers
wonderful
view
of
the
Houses
of
Parliament
directly
across
the
river
The
similarity
to
Londonâs
own
Parliament
(Big
Ben
aside)
is
quite
striking
with
the
Danube
simply
substituted
for
the
Thames
The
Vienna
stagecoach
terminal
used
to
be
just
around
the
corner
and
the
once
famous
White
Cross
Inn
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
to
the
river
was
the
fashionable
venue
for
balls
and
festivities
Itâs
still
grand
old
building
even
if
its
role
has
now
diminished
to
that
of
nightclub
renamed
Casanova
after
the
famous
rake
who
reputedly
stayed
here
On
the
south
side
of
the
square
is
Szent
Anna
templom
(St
Anneâs
Church)
ï¬ne
mid-18th-century
structure
with
Italianate
inï¬uences
Farther
north
along
Fo
utca
is
another
excellent
example
of
Turkish
bath
The
KirÃ¡ly
fÃ¼rdo
(KirÃ¡ly
Baths)
were
established
in
the
16th
century
and
the
authentic
Turkish
section
has
survived
complete
with
an
octagonal
pool
under
the
largest
dome
Apart
from
the
steam
bath
visitors
can
use
the
bath
tubs
sauna
and
several
other
facilities
Turn
left
off
Frakel
LeÃ³
Ãºt
(the
continuation
of
Fo
utca)
at
Margit
hÃ­d
(Margaret
Bridge)
and
follow
the
signpost
up
the
steps
to
another
Turkish
memento
the
GÃ¼l
Baba
tÃ¼rbÃ©je
(the
tomb
of
GÃ¼l
Baba)
This
meticulously
preserved
mausoleum
was
built
in
the
mid-16th
century
for
GÃ¼l
Baba
famous
dervish
killed
during
the
siege
of
Buda
in
1541
whose
funeral
was
attended
by
the
Sultan
The
interior
in
keeping
with
the
Muslim
tradition
is
quite
simple
with
the
tomb
surrounded
by
carpets
and
few
artworks
from
the
Turkish
government
The
hill
on
which
the
tomb
stands
called
the
RÃ³zsadomb
(âHill
of
the
Rosesâ)
is
one
of
the
most
exclusive
addresses
in
Budapest
Buda
Hills
The
Buda
Hills
area
is
greenbelt
that
lies
due
west
of
RÃ³zsadomb
though
it
stretches
as
far
north
as
Obuda
and
as
far
south
as
the
start
of
the
M7
highway
Choose
clear
day
then
catch
any
one
of
several
trams
or
buses
which
go
past
the
cog-railway
terminus
(just
west
of
Moszkva
tÃ©r
opposite
the
Hotel
Budapest)
There
is
room
on
the
train
for
mountain
bikes
if
you
are
feeling
particularly
active
The
train
passes
smart
residential
houses
on
its
way
to
the
terminus
and
park
of
SvÃ¡b-hegy
short
walk
across
the
park
(just
follow
the
crowds)
is
the
stop
for
the
Childrenâs
Railway
(SzÃ©chenyi-hegyi
GyermekvasÃºt)
thus
named
because
it
is
operated
almost
entirely
by
school-children;
only
the
engine
drivers
are
adults
This
is
an
old
narrow-gauge
line
which
traverses
seemingly
unspoiled
forestsÂ âÂ but
for
the
numerous
walking
trailsÂ âÂ and
climbs
slowly
ever-upwards
At
the
ï¬rst
stop
Normafa
youâll
find
ski-run
but
unless
itâs
snowing
stay
on
the
train
until

It
is
10â15
minute
walk
from
here
to
the
JÃ¡nos-hegy
lookout
tower
at
529
metres
(1,735
feet)
the
highest
point
in
the
city
If
the
horizon
is
not
blurred
by
mist
thereâs
splendid
360-degree
view
for
mile
upon
mile;
you
can
also
eat
here
On
the
way
to
the
lookout
tower
you
will
have
passed
chair-lift
that
goes
down
to
camping
site
The
views
from
the
chair-lift
are
also
spectacular
and
the
peace
and
quiet
as
you
soar
up
and
down
the
mountainside
is
quite
extraordinary
Remember
to
note
that
the
chairlift
is
closed
on
some
MondaysÂ âÂ check

bottom
of
the
chair-lift
Between
the
Banks
Just
as
Tower
Bridge
is
the
toast
of
London
the
Golden
Gate
is
the
pride
of
San
Francisco
and
the
Brooklyn
Bridge
is
symbol
of
New
York
Budapest
too
has
its
landmark
river
crossings
The
most
venerable
of
these
is
the
SzÃ©chenyi
LÃ¡nchÃ­d
or
Chain
Bridge
opened
in
1849
the
ï¬rst
span
to
unite
Buda
and
Pest
Count
IstvÃ¡n
SzÃ©chenyi
great
innovator
of
his
age
imported
the
technology
and
expertise
of
the
British
Industrial
Revolution
to
help
Hungaryâs
own
reform
programme
The
bridge
was
designed
by
an
English
engineer
William
Tierney
Clark
and
its
construction
was
supervised
by
Scotsman
Adam
Clark
(no
relation)
who
has
square
named
after
him
at
the
Buda
end
of
the
bridge
Donât
miss
the
ï¬oodlit
view
of
the
bridgeÂ âÂ itâs
one
of
the
cityâs
ï¬nest
sights
South
of
the
Chain
Bridge
is
the
rather
more
functional-looking
ErzsÃ©bet
hÃ­d
(Elizabeth
Bridge)
named
after
the
consort
of
Franz
Joseph
tragically
assassinated
in
1898
The
bridge
opened
in
1964
is
of
modern
design
and
works
on
the
suspension
principle
Southwards
from
Elizabeth
Bridge
is
the
SzabadsÃ¡g
hÃ­d
(Liberty
Bridge)
opened
in
1896
and
originally
called
the
Franz
Joseph
Bridge
Itâs
handsome
green
iron
structure
with
turul
birds
(see
page
17)
perched
on
golden
ball
balancing
on
each
pillar
To
the
north
of
the
Chain
Bridge
is
Margit
hÃ­d
(Margaret
Bridge)
modern
replacement
of
the
19th-century
version

Margaret
Island
(Margit-sziget)
The
elite
of
the
Roman
empire
escaped
everyday
cares
on
this
leafy
oasis
between
the
two
banks
and
in
later
eras
princes
and
plutocrats
did
likewise
Today
wealthy
tourists
enjoy
the
thermal
facilities
and
treatments
offered
at
the
two
international-class
hotels
on
the
island
The
leisure
establishment
of
most
interest
to
visitors
is
the
huge
outdoor
Palatinus
Baths
(Palatinus
strand)
which
includes
thermal
pools
and
boasts
capacity
of
20,000
swimmers
and
sunbathers
The
island
is
not
just
for
tourists
however:
Budapestis
of
all
ages
come
here
to
walk
run
swim
play
tennis
or
team
games
or
simply
sunbathe
Itâs
also
famous
spot
for
courting
couples
The
island
is
km
(11â2
miles)
long
and
only
few
hundred
yards
at
the
widest
part
Many
of
its
estimated
population
of
10,000
trees
are
now
more
than
century
old
and
large
areas
of
the
island
are
lawned
and
landscaped
Best
of
all
cars
(with
few
exceptions)
are
prohibited
thus
preserving
the
islandâs
peace
and
quiet
Alongside
landmark
water
tower
is
good
open-air
theatre
which
presents
concerts
opera
and
ballet
performances
in
the
summer
Nearby
are
the
ruins
of
13th-century
Dominican
Convent
that
was
founded
by
King
BÃ©la
IV
Here
he
enrolled
his
11-year-old
daughter
Margit
in
fulï¬lment
of
vow
he
had
made
should
he
live
to
survive
the
Mongol
invasion
Princess
(and
later
saint)
Margit
stayed
on
the
island
for
the
rest
of
her
life;
it
was
subsequently
named
after
her
Her
burial
place
is
marked
by
marble
plaque
The
other
ruins
close
by
include
Franciscan
Church
and
monastery
built
in
the
13th
century
The
charming
little
Premonstratensian
ChapelÂ âÂ a
20th-century
reconstruction
of
the
original
12th-century
churchÂ âÂ is
still
in
use
today
It
houses
15th-century

the
oldest

Hungary
Pest
The
bulk
of
modern
Budapest
lies
to
the
east
of
the
Danube
in
what
was
until
1873
the
autonomous
city
of
Pest
Here
is
the
true
pulse
of
Budapest:
large
hotels
museums
government
buildings
shopping
streets
nightlife
and
thunderously
busy
boulevards
From
the
Romansâ
point
of
view
defending
Buda
(and
therefore
western
civilization)
was
real
headache
All
they
could
do
was
stare
across
the
great
expanse
of
ï¬at
badlands
to
the
east
of
the
river
and
wait
for
the
barbarians
to
arrive
So
in
a.d
294
they
decided
to
build
defence
on
the
east
side
to
make
it
harder
for
any
invaders
to
establish
foothold
here
They
called
the
place
Contra-Aquincum;
it
is
still
at
the
core
of
the
inner
city
of
Pest
The
Inner
City
(BelvÃ¡ros)
medieval
town
grew
around
the
Roman
defence-post
evolving
into
long
narrow
strip
with
the
Danube
to
the
west
and
defensive
walls
on
the
other
sides
The
so-called
Kis-kÃ¶rÃºt
(Little
Boulevard)
follows
the
line
of
the
old
walls
and
encloses
the
district
of
BelvÃ¡ros
(Note
that
you
wonât
ï¬nd
Kis-kÃ¶rÃºt
on
any
mapÂ âÂ itâs
the
aggregate
of
VÃ¡mhÃ¡z
kÃ¶rÃºt
MÃºzeum

KÃ¡roly

utca.)
The
oldest
building
in
Pest
is
the
BelvÃ¡rosi
templom
(Inner
City
Parish
Church)
The
exterior
is
rather
unprepossessingÂ âÂ a
sooty
Baroque
church
hemmed
into
an
undigniï¬ed
position
by
the
Elizabeth
BridgeÂ âÂ but
look
inside
and
you
can
discern
much
earlier
elements
in
the
handsome
interior
It
was
founded
in
the
12th
century
and
some
Romanesque
construction
is
still
visible
So
too
is
the
influence
of
the
Turks
who
turned
the
church
into
mosque
and
carved
mihrab
(prayer
niche)
on
the
Mecca
side
of
the
chancel
wall
Next
to
the
church
is
all
that
remains
of
Contra-AquincumÂ âÂ an
excavated
square
with
benches
and
small
display
of
tablets
and
reliefs
found
on
the
site
The
centrepiece
of
Pestâs
pedestrian
zone
is
VÃ¡ci
utca
(pronounced
Vah-tsee
utsa)
the
first
place
to
visit
for
shopping
in
the
city
Here
you
will
ï¬nd
the
best
fashion
art
cosmetics
books
and
jewellery;
the
biggest
and
the
best
branch
of
Folkart
(see
page
78);
the
Pest
SzÃ­nhÃ¡z
(theatre)
where
Franz
Liszt
made
his
city
debut
as
12-year-old
pianist;
various
airline
offices
and
several
international
organizations
VÃ¡ci
utca
runs
into
the
ever-busy
yet
somehow
relaxed
VÃ¶rÃ¶smarty
tÃ©r
This
is
one
of
Pestâs
favourite
gathering
places
often
lined
with
craft
stalls
and
resounding
to
brass
band
After
browse
through
Luxus
department
store
itâs
probably
time
for
coffee
and
cakes
at
Gerbeaud
doyen
of
Budapestâs
coffee-house
scene
since
1884
If
the
sumptuous
high-ceilinged
interior
is
little
too
formal
for
your
liking
then
take
terrace
seat
and
watch
the
world
go
by
Stroll
few
yards
towards
the
river
and
you
will
come
to
yet
another
pleasant
and
lively
square
VigadÃ³
tÃ©r
which
has
the
advantage
of
riverside
location
with
Castle
Hill
views
Here
too
you
will
find
craft
stalls
and
any
number
of
buskers
vibrant
cafÃ©-restaurant
comprises
one
side
of
the
square
but
the
dominant
building
is
the
splendid
VigadÃ³
theatre
The
interior
hall
is
an
acoustically
perfect
auditorium
renovated
in
1980
(its
predecessors
having
twice
perished
in
war
and
revolution)
but
the
faÃ§ade
has
been
gloriously
restored
in
mid-19th-century
Hungarian-Eastern
style
The
list
of
performers
and
conductors
who
have
graced
the
VigadÃ³
theatre
is
an
impressive
Whoâs
Who
of
the
past
150
years
of
European
classical
music:
Liszt
Brahms
Wagner
Mahler
BartÃ³k
Prokoï¬ev
Casals
BjÃ¶rling
and
von
Karajan
This
is
also
the
centre
of
what
may
be
called
âthe
Hotel
Zone,â
with
four
luxury
hotels
within
very
short
distance
of
each
other
Their
architecture
has
done
nothing
for
the
aesthetics
of
the
embankment
viewed
from
the
Buda
side
of
the
river
but
ironically
looking
in
the
opposite
direction
they
provide
some
of
the
ï¬nest
views
of
the
city
From
VÃ¶rÃ¶smarty
tÃ©r
take
DeÃ¡k
Ferenc
utca
into
busy
DeÃ¡k
tÃ©r
Just
to
the
east
of
the
pedestrianized
zone
(across
Petoï¬
SÃ¡ndor
utca)
are
number
of
intriguing
buildings
and
two
small
museums
Next
to
the
ordinary
Lutheran
Church
is
the
National
Lutheran
Museum
which
houses
valuable
collection
including
documents
bibles
and
chalices
It
chronicles
the
story
of
some
of
the
distinguished
Protestants
influential
in
the
history
of
this
predominantly
Catholic
country
As
DeÃ¡k
tÃ©r
is
the
only
meeting
point
for
all
three
metro
lines
itâs
an
apt
place
for
the
tiny
Metro
Museum
(FAV
MÃºzeum)
located
down
in
the
pedestrian
subway
Here
you
can
see
the
original
train
that
travelled
on
Europeâs
first
continental
underground
railway
in
1896Â âÂ itâs
hardly
different
to
those

It
was
built
in

as

served
for

Directly
across
the
busy
road
(itâs
best
to
use
the
underpass)
are
three
ï¬ne
churches
and
part
of
the
university
complex
On
the
corner
of
Ferenciek
tere
stands
the
Franciscan
Church
constructed
around
1758
Look

Built
between
1725
and
1742
by
the

splendidly
rich
Baroque

Turn
into
Szerb

there
are
more
university

The
Serbian

dates
from

and
has
beautiful

The
Little
Boulevard
Despite
its
diminutive
name
the
Little
Boulevard
is
very
big
on
trafï¬c;
it
is
definitely
not
the
place
for
leisurely
stroll
There
are
however
three
major
points
of
interest
that
fall
just
outside
the
inner
city
side
of
this
notional
dividing
line
The
most
popular
of
these
among
locals
is
the
Budapest
Market
Halls
(VÃ¡sÃ¡rcsarnok)
at
the
beginning
of
VÃ¡mhÃ¡z
kÃ¶rÃºt
by
the
SzabadsÃ¡g
hÃ­d
(Liberty
Bridge)
This
vast
old-fashioned
covered
market
is
brimming
with
local
colour
and
exotic
smells
There
is
also
lively
daily
market
at
Lehel
tÃ©r
north
of
the
inner
city
in
the
LipÃ³tvÃ¡ros
district
(take
metro
line
to
the
station
at
Lehel
tÃ©r)
For
visitors
the
most
popular
Little
Boulevard
attraction
is
the
Hungarian
National
Museum
(Magyar
Nemzeti
MÃºzeum)
This
impressive
structure
built
in
Neo-Classical
style
with
Corinthian
columns
and
sculptured
tympanum
stands
back
off
the
road
in
its
own
big
garden
Inside
amid
monumental
architectural
and
ornamental
details
the
whole
story
of
Hungary
unfolds
On
display
are
prehistoric
remains
and
ancient
jewels
and
tools
but
thereâs
no
doubt
as
to
which
is
the
main
point
of
interest:
just
follow
the
crowd
to
the
hushed
room
where
the
royal
regalia
resides
The
crown
is
romantically
associated
with
St
Stephen
the
great
11th-century
king
but
is
actually
of
slightly
later
date
(the
lower
half
is
11th
century;
the
upper
12th
century)
The
beautiful
gold-threaded
mantle
made
in
1031
is
said
to
belong
to
St
Stephen
The
sceptre
also
dates
from
around
the
12th
century
Itâs
believed
that
both
the
14th-century
gilded
orb
and
the
16th-century
sword
are
replacements
of
the
original
regalia
that
was
lost
The
exhibition
downstairs
which
deals
with
the
history
of
the
Carpathian
Basin
from
prehistoric
times
right
up
to
the
Conquest
of
896
has
some
good
moments
particularly
when
covering
the
Roman
period
(itâs
worthwhile
buying
copy
of
the
English/German
guide
book
which
costs
only
few
forints)
The
exhibit
upstairs
covering
the
period
from
896
to
1849
is
of
more
general
interest
than
the
previous
millennium
17th-century
Turkish
tent
decked
out
with
carpets
is
one
highlight
while
other
exhibits
run
the
gamut
of
war
and
peace
from
suits
of
armour
to
room
reconstructions
The
museum
also
boasts
natural
history
section
but
compared
to
the
riches
of
the
rest
of
the
collection
this
is
entirely
optional
viewing
Back
on
the
Little
Boulevard
at
the
start
of
DohÃ¡ny
utca
is
striking
synagogue
of
enormous
proportions
built
in
ï¬amboyant
Byzantine-Moorish
style
This
is
the
Central
or
Great
Synagogue
dating
from
the
mid-19th
century
which
is
claimed
by
some
sources
to
be
the
biggest
in
Europe
capable
of
holding
up
to
3,000
people
Visitors
are

basilica
is
dimly
lit
There
is
an
interesting
main
attraction
in
reliquary
in
rear
chapel:
the
Szent
Jobb
(âHoly
Rightâ)
is
the
much
revered
holy
relic
of
the
right
hand
of
St
Stephen;
youâll
need
20-forint
piece
to
illuminate
it
SzabadsÃ¡g
tÃ©r
(Freedom
Square)
short
walk
to
the
north
is
probably
Pestâs
ï¬nest
architectural
ensemble
At
its
centre
is
an
obelisk
dedicated
to
the
Soviet
troops
who
fell
in
the
city
but
the
enormous
ostentatious
buildings
surrounding
the
square
are
what
really
steal
the
show
The
superb
lemon-coloured
Art
Nouveau
building
close
to
the
obelisk
is
home
to
the
American
Embassy
Next
door
is
the
former
Stock
Exchange
(now
the
countryâs
TV
headquarters)
showy
eclectic
building
with
some
good
reliefs
The
Hungarian
National
Bank
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
is
the
work
of
the
same
architect
The
great
dome
of
Parliament
equal
in
height
to
that
of
the
basilica
is
clearly
visible
from
the
square
The
Houses
of
Parliament
(OrszÃ¡ghÃ¡z)
were
built
between
1885
and
1902
as
symbol
of
the
grandeur
of
the
Austro-Hungarian
empire
Its
vital
statistics
are
impressive:
268
metres
(879
feet)
long
691
rooms
and
an
estimated
20
km
(12
miles)
of
staircase
inside
The
architect
may
not
have
had
Londonâs
Houses
of
Parliament
in
mind
but
whatever
his
intentions
the
Neo-Gothic
arches
and
turrets
rarely
escape
comparison
with
those
of
Westminster
Tourists
are
only
admitted
on
group
excursions
and
only
to
certain
parts
of
the
building
when
parliament
is
not
in
session;
the
visiting
arrangements
do
vary
from
year
to
year
(check
with
Tourinform
as
to
the
current
situation)
If
you
are
admitted
on
guided
tour
you
will
probably
be
taken
up
the
grandiose
central
stairway
to
splendid
16-sided
domed
hall
then
into
the
lobby
and
ï¬nally
into
the
principal
debating
chamber
of
the
House
(Look
out
for
the
brass
rack
where
deputies
leave
their
cigars
before
they
enter
the
chamber.)
Across
from
parliament
is
the
mighty
Ethnographic
Museum
(NÃ©prajzi
MÃºzeum)
built
in
the
same
era
occupying
the
former
location
of
the
Supreme
Court
of
Justice
It
is
worth
visit
for
the
palatial
interiors
alone
but
the
exhibits
here
are
also
some
of
the
most
fascinating
in
the
city
Permanent
displays
show
the
fast-disappearing
world
of
Hungarian
rural
life
and
folklore;
these
are
underpinned
by
trenchant
temporary
exhibitions
dealing
with
current
issues
such
as
the
lives
of
Budapestâs
gypsies
AndrÃ¡ssy
Ãºt
The
most
attractive
avenue
in
the
city
modelled
after
the
Champs-ElysÃ©es
in
Paris
was
bold
stroke
of
the
1870s
Travelling
straight
as
an
arrow
almost
2.4
km
(11â2
miles)
from
the
inner
city
to
the
City
Park
it
is
the
site
of
some
of
the
ï¬nest
architecture
in
Budapest
The
buildings
that
line
it
blend
well
yet
almost
every
one
has
unique
featureÂ âÂ a
fountain
statue
mosaic
or
frieze
columns
or
arches
Thereâs
roomy
patrician
feeling
here
which
belies
the
avenueâs
past
namesÂ âÂ from
the
unpronounceable
NÃ©pkÃ¶ztÃ¡rsasÃ¡g
Ãºtja
(Peopleâs
Republic
Avenue)
to
the
prosaic
SugÃ¡r
Ãºt
(Radial
Road)
to
the
hated
Stalin
Ãºt
You
can
visit
one
of
the
typically
large
ï¬n-de-siÃ¨cle
aristocratic
homes
right
at
the
start
of
the
avenue
at
number
3
now
home
to
the
Postal
Museum
There
are
some
colourful
and
interesting
exhibits
here
(particularly
the
correspondence
between
Thomas
Edison
and
the
Hungarian
telecommunications
pioneer
Tivadar
PuskÃ¡s)
but
the
real
attraction
is
the
building
itself
particularly
the
stairway
and
balcony
decorated
with
outstanding
frescoes
by
KÃ¡roly
Lotz
The
State
Opera
House
(AndrÃ¡ssy
Ãºt
22)
completed
in
1884
by
MiklÃ³s
Ybl
is
the
most
admired
building
on
the
avenue
Its
Italianate
style
and
restrained
proportions
ï¬t
in
exquisitely
with
its
surroundings
The
splendidly
opulent
interior
may
be
visited
by
guided
tours
which
are
conducted
daily
at
3:00
and
4:00
p.m.
subject
to
performances
The
architecture
atmosphere
and
acoustics
of
the
State
Opera
House
rank
it
among
the
very
best
in
Europe
If
you
prefer
entertainment
of
slightly
less
highbrow
nature
then
continue
north
for
block
to
the
area
known
as
âBudapestâs
Broadway,â
where
you
will
ï¬nd
several
theatres
and
nightspots
The
cultural
theme
continues
on
the
pedestrianized
area
of
Liszt
Ferenc
tÃ©r
where
there
is
an
excellent
modern
statue
of
Liszt
conducting
in
caricature
with
ï¬ailing
hands
and
windswept
hair
At
the
end
of
this
street
is
the
Academy
of
Music
completed
in
1907
This
is
an
Art
Nouveau
gem
from
the
faÃ§adeÂ âÂ where
the
statue
and
name
of
Liszt
dominateÂ âÂ through
to
the
lobby
and
interior
It
is
quite
easy
to
get
look
inside
when
there
is
no
one
playing
Cross
the
busy
intersection
of
Oktogon
and
three
streets
north
at
VÃ¶rÃ¶smarty
utca

is
the
Ferenc
Liszt

This
is

and
period
furnishings
set
in
an
apartment
where
the
composer
once
lived
(closed
Sunday
and
the
first
three
weeks
of
August)
As
AndrÃ¡ssy
Ãºt
heads
farther
away
from
town
the
villas
get
noticeably
grander
and
mansions
in
garden
settings
become
predominant

Facing

Undergoing
long-term

the
building
on
the
left
is
the
Museum
of
Fine
Arts
(SzÃ©pmuvÃ©szeti
MÃºzeum)
holding
the
cityâs
most
highly
regarded
collection
which
ranges
from
Egyptian
mummies
and
Greek
and
Roman
relics
(the
latter
collection
is
undergoing
long-term
restoration)
through
Renaissance
works
to
collection
of
about
2,500
Old
Masters
of
which
some
800
are
on
show
at
any

Italian
Dutch
German

schools
are
all
superbly
represented
The
latter
is
particularly
notable
with
masterpieces
by
El
Greco
Goya
and
several
other
famous
names
There
are
also
English
French
and
Flemish
rooms
The
favourite
room
for

however
is
the
19th-century

(a
modern

of
the
work
of
contemporary
Hungarian

away
from
the

where
Budapestis

go
to
the

or

The
park
which
covers
some
101
hectares
(250
acres)
began
to
evolve
in
the
early
19th
century
though
many
of
the
present
amenities
were
added
during
preparations
for
the
Millennium
festivities
of
1896
Cross
the
bridge
over
the
boating
lake
which
doubles
as
an
ice-skating
rink
in
winter
The
Castle
of
Vajdahunyad
behind
the
lake
was
built
as
prop
for
the
Millenary
Exhibition
but
proved
so
popular
that
it
was
rebuilt
in
permanent
form
It
reproduces
in
convincing
detail
part
of
the
exterior
of
the
fairytale
Hunyadi
castle
in
Transylvania
Inside
the
castle
is
the
Museum
of
Hungarian
Agriculture
housing
comprehensive
collection
that
illustrates
the
history
of
hunting
fishing
and
farming
If
you
want
to
see
the
castle
at
its
best
return
by
night
when
it
is
beautifully
illuminated
Within
the
grounds
thereâs
Catholic
church
with
splendid
Romanesque
portal
(another
reconstruction)
and
one
of
the
cityâs
favourite
statues
which
depicts
the
medieval
chronicler
who
gave
Hungary
its
ï¬rst
written
records
Unfortunately
he
didnât
leave
us
his
name
so
his
face
is
hidden
deep
inside
the
cowl
of
his
monkâs-style
robe;
he
is
referred
to
simply
as
Anonymous
There
are
two
more
museums
in
the
park
both
towards
its
top
right-hand
corner
The
Museum
of
Aviation
and
Space
Travel
occupies
part
of
the
Petoï¬
Csarnok
(Petoï¬
Hall)
the
city
youth-centre
where
rock
concerts
often
take
place
while
you
will
find
the
Transport
Museum
(KÃ¶zlekedÃ©si
MÃºzeum)
on
the
perimeter
path
of
the
park
Both
of
these
deal
almost
exclusively
with
Hungarian
developments
and
are
most
likely
to
appeal
to
specialists
or
children
The
jewel
in
the
park
is
the
SzÃ©chenyi
Baths
complex
to
the
left
of
the
road
that
bisects
the
park
This
is
one
of
the
largest
medicinal
bath
complexes
in
Europe;
it
also
provides
year-round
open-air
swimming
at
constant
27Â°C
(81Â°F)
in
beautiful
surroundings
The
buildings
constructed
between
1909
and
1913
in
Baroque
Art
Nouveau
style
are
topped
by
series
of
huge
green
domes
Inside
the
pool
area
the
walls
are
ivy-clad
and
there
is
some
sumptuous
statuary
but
even
more
interesting
than
the
architecture
of
the
baths
is
the
bizarre
sight
of
groups
of
men
playing
chess
while
immersed
in
warm
water
(their
boards
are
supported
on
small
jetties
protruding
into
the
pool)
Just
behind
the
baths
are
the
zoo
and
two
amusement
parks
The
zoo
welcomes
visitors
with
an
Art
Nouveau
entrance
decorated
with
polar
bears
and
elephants
It
keeps
wide
range
of
animals
including
most
childrenâs
and
adultsâ
favourite
species
The
animals
are
mostly
held
in
traditional
cages
though
renovations
on
several
pavilions
are
in
progress
Grown-ups
may
like
to
note
that
next
to
the
zoo
is
Gundelâs
restaurant

in
Hungarian
culinary
circles

boats
make
five-hour
journey
all
the
way
from
Budapest
to
Esz-tergom
stopping
en
route
at
Szentendre
and
VisegrÃ¡d
On
your
approach
to
Szentendre
donât
be
put
off
by
the
modern
suburbsÂ âÂ the
heart
of
the
town
remains
virtually
locked
in
the
18th
century
Right
at
the

is
Fo

picture-postcard
cobblestone
square
The
iron
rococo
cross
in
the
centre
was
erected
in
1763
by
the
Serbian
community
(in
gratitude
for
being
spared
by
the
plague)
and
the
majestic
Serbian
church
on
the
hill
is
the
townâs
most
prominent
landmark
Serbian
refugees
twice
settled
here
in
the
wake
of
Turkish
invasions:
first
in
the
late
13th
century
and
then
again
in
1690
On
the
latter
occasion
around
8,000
Serbs
brought
their
religion
art
architecture
trades
and
crafts
and
commercial
acumen
to
Szentendre
The
church
in
the
square
the
Blagovestenska
Eastern
Orthodox
is
known
as
the
Greek
Church
(Greek
refugees
also
ï¬ed
here)
even
though
it
too
is
Serbian
Built
in
the
mid-18th
century
its
interior
is
little
gem
with
collection
of
Serb-painted
icons
well
worth
seeing
On
one
side
of
the
church
in
what
used
to
be
an
18th-century
schoolhouse
you
will
find
the
Ferenczy
Museum
displaying
works
by
the
Hungarian
Impressionist
KÃ¡roly
Ferenczy
and
his
two
children
Another
museum
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
church
conï¬rms
Szentendreâs
status
as
an
important
artistsâ
colony
The
Margit
KovÃ¡cs
Museum
is
the
former
home
and
workshop
of
ceramicist
Margit
KovÃ¡cs
(1907â1977)
unknown
outside
Hungary
but
worthy
of
an
international
audience
Inside
there
are
attenuated
sculptures
of
wide-eyed
damsels
poignant
religious
icons
and
âordinary
people,â
stooped
and
tragic
bearing
the
whole
weight
of
Hungaryâs
20th-century
misfortunes
The
rust-red
mid-18th-century
Serbian
church
on
the
hill
is
only
open
for
services
but
in
its
grounds
is
the
excellent
Collection
of
Serbian
Ecclesiastical
Art
displaying
precious
carvings
icons
and
manuscripts
The
oldest
church
in
the
town
lies
just
above
here
on
top
of
the
hill
affording
perfect
vantage
point
from
which
to
peer
down
into
the
tiny
gardens
and
courtyards
and
across
the
townâs
venerable
rooftops
The
Catholic
parish
church
dates
mostly
from
the
13th
century
though
parts
of
it
go
back
to
the
11th
century
During
summer
and
early
autumn
craft
and
souvenir
stalls
congregate
around
here
Opposite
the
church
is
another
good
local
artistâs
collection
that
of
the
Impressionist
BÃ©la
CzÃ³bel
You
will
ï¬nd
much
more
art
on
display
in
town
but
donât
miss
the
modern
art
in
the
Barcsay
Collection
(on
the
road
out
to
the
bus
and
railway
station)
If
you
want
change
from
museums
and
galleries
4-km
(21â2-mile)
trip
out
of
town
brings
you
to
great
place
for
historic

the
Hungarian
Open
Air

Museum
(Sza-badtÃ©ri
NÃ©prajzi

which
is
an
offshoot
of
the

Catch
the

bus
departing
from
the

next
to
the
HEV

and
ask
for
the
âSkanzen.â
There
are
also
regular
buses
from
the
Tourinform
ofï¬ce
on
the
road
from
the
bus
station
to
the
centre
The
46-hectare
(115-acre)
museum
site
will
eventually
contain
ten
âvillagesâ
of
real
houses
churches
mills
farm
buildings
workshops
and
smithys
dating
mostly
from
the
late
18th
to
the
early
20th
century
and
culled
from
all
over
Hungary
At
present
there
are
only
three
settlements
to
view
but
even
these
will
occupy
you
for
at
least
half
day
and
possibly
longer
It
is
fascinating
and
picturesque
simulation
of
old
rural
Hungary
brought
to
life
by
active
craftspeople
gingerbread
makers
and
other
ârural
folk.â
(Try
to
come
on
the
ï¬rst
or
third
Sunday
of
the

when
there
are
several
different

An
excellent

Donât

climbing
up
the
hill
to
visit
the
Greek
Catholic
Church
from
MÃ¡ndok
(in
northeast
Hungary)
originally
built
in
1670
and
boasting
painted
iconostasis
The

VisegrÃ¡d
Farther
up
the
river
where
the
Danube
bends
lies
VisegrÃ¡d
You
can
get
here
by
boat
or
the
bus
from
Szentendre
This
is
one
of
the
most
picturesque
sections
of
the
river
where
verdant
hillsides
roll
down
almost
to
the
waterâs
edge
The
ï¬nest
place
to
enjoy
the
viewsÂ âÂ reminiscent
of
the
best
of
the
RhineÂ âÂ are
at
the
Citadel
high
on
hill
above
the
ruins
of
the
old
palace
of
VisegrÃ¡d
(which
means
âhigh
castleâ
in
Slavic)
The
strategic
value
of
site
commanding
the
river
bend
has
been
recognized
since
the
fourth
century
when
the
Romans
built
fort
here
In
the
14th
century
the
Angevin
kings
of
Hungary
built
palace
on
the
site
each
monarch
adding
new
rooms
and
more
opulence
until
the
establishment
covered
an
area
now
estimated
at
some
18
hectares
(44
acres)
By
the
end
of
the
15th
century
when
King
MÃ¡tyÃ¡s
(see
page
16)
was
resident
the
palace
like
his
grand
Buda
residence
was
famous
all
over
Europe
One
rather
unwilling
and
notorious
resident
was
the
monstrous
Vlad
the
Impaler
(on
whom
the
Dracula
legend
was
partly
based)
held
prisoner
here
from
1462
to
1475
Like
King
MÃ¡tyÃ¡sâs
Royal
Palace
in
Buda
the
palace
of
VisegrÃ¡d
fell
into
ruins
in
the
Turkish
occupation
and
was
completely
forgotten
Excavations
began
in
1930;
part
of
the
main
building
has
been
unearthed
and
certain
parts
have
been
rebuilt
(using
obviously
new
materials
to
differentiate
these
sections
from
the
original
ones)
Among
the
best
of
the
discoveries
are
the
superb
Hercules
Fountain
(a
rare
vestige
of
Hungarian
Renaissance
architecture)
the
vaulted
galleries
of
the
Court
of
Honour
and
the
restored
Lionâs
Fountain
On
the
hillside
the
hexagonal
tower
known
as
the
Tower
of
Solomon
is
now
museum
of
the
palace
Topping
it
all
is
the
Citadel
which
was
once
considered
so
impregnable
that
the
Hungarian
crown
jewels
were
kept
here
Esztergom
The
third
of
the
Danube
Bend
towns
Esztergom
situated
farther
20
km
(12
miles)
upriver
is
linked
by
hydrofoil
to
Budapest
and
by
boat
or
bus
to
Szentendre
and
VisegrÃ¡d
Take
the
boat
if
you
have
two
hours
to
spare
as
the
riverâs
most
scenic
stretch
lies
between
VisegrÃ¡d
and
Esztergom
King
Stephen
was
born
in
Esztergom
during
his
time
the
medieval
capital
of
Hungary
It
is
still
the
religious
centre
of
the
country
boasting
the
largest
church
in
the
land
The
towering
basilica
stands
on
the
site
of
an
11th-century
church
where
Stephen
was
crowned
as
the
ï¬rst
king
of
Hungary
in
the
year
1000
This
church
was
destroyed
in
the
struggle
with
the
Turks
and
for
all
its
massive
dimensions
(or
perhaps
because
of
its
size)
the
only
part
of
the
current
structure
that
generates
an
ancient
atmosphere
is
the
rather
spooky
crypt
The
most
valuable
part
of
the
basilica
is
the
red-marble
side
chapel
called
the
BakÃ³cz-kÃ¡polnaÂ âÂ a
pure
example
of
Italian
Renaissance
style
Built
in
the
16th
century
the
chapel
taken
from
the
ruins
around
it
and
reassembled
in
the
19th
century
is
all
that
survives
of
the
original
basilica
Note
the
white
marble
altar
which
was
sculpted
by
Florentine
master
Donât
miss
climbing
the
stairs
of
the
Basilica
for
two
more
highlights
The
treasury
contains
what
purports
to
be
Hungaryâs
richest
store
of
religious
objects
including
crystal
cross
from
the
ninth
century
and
the
15th-century
Calvary
of
King
MÃ¡tyÃ¡s
From
priceless
treasures
ascend
the
tower
for
priceless
view
As
well
as
looking
down
over
the
town
you
can
also
see
across
into
Slovakia
The
Danube
forms
natural
boundary;
the
bridge
that
up
until
World
War
linked
the
two
countries
was
symbolically
left
in
ruins
Itâs
melancholy
sight
that
recalls
Hungaryâs
claim
on
that
part
of
the
land
north
of
the
river
lost
in
the
punitive
1920
Treaty
of
Trianon
Those
interested
can
cross
over
by
ferry
at
this
point
(Note
that
the
treasury
as
well
as
the
tower
are
closed
from
November
to
April.)
Alongside
the
basilica
the
remains
of
medieval
royal
palace
have
been
excavated
and
restored
and
today
house
the
Castle
Museum
Among
the
highlights
in
the
museum
are
St
Stephenâs
Hall
the
frescoed
Hall
of
Virtues
(listed
as
Prudence
Temperance
Fortitude
and
Justice)
and
the
12th-century
Royal
Chapel
The

The
Christian
Museum
(KeresztÃ©ny
MÃºzeum)
with
the
most
important
provincial
collection
in
Hungary
is
the
best
religious
art
museum
in
the
country
Covering
mostly
the
Gothic
and
Renaissance
periods
from
the
13th
to
the
16th
centuries
it
has
some
very
good
14th-
and
15th-century
Italian
paintings

Lake
Balaton
Hungary
may
be
deprived
of
coastline
but
in
Lake
Balaton
freshwater
haven
surrounded
by
verdant
hills
fertile
plains
orchards
vineyards
and
historic
villages
they
have
the
next
best
thing
The
northwest
tip
of
Balaton
is
around
100
km
(60
miles)
from
Budapest
lying
within
an
easy
and
comfortable
day-trip
of
the
capital
Buses
and
trains
serve
the
lake
and
coach
excursions
visit
here
in
summer
Balaton
is
the
biggest
lake
in
central
and
western
Europe
measuring
77
km
(48
miles)
across
with
an
area
of
nearly
600
km2
(230
square
miles)
Yet
its
average
depth
is
less
than
metres
(10
feet);
in
winter
it
freezes
over
completely
while
in
summer
the
shallow
water
is
subject
to
wind-driven
waves
and
when
storm
blows
up
even
the
ferries
call
it
day
However
for
most
of
the
summer
the
hot
sun
warms
the
tranquil
lake
almost
up
to
air
temperature
luring
swimmers
in
the
thousands
into
the
water
Whatâs
more
the
mildly
alkaline
water
is
said
to
be
positively
healthy
for
bathingÂ âÂ a
claim
that
few
seaside
resorts
can
make
in
these
days
of
polluted
shores
The
Balaton
authorities
also
ensure
that
the
lake
is
kept
clean
and
calm
by
banning
motor
boats
(with
exceptions
that
require
special
permits)
If
the
ï¬sh
are
barometer
of
lakeâs
health
all
would
appear
to
be
hazard
free:
about
40
species
thrive
in
it
Balaton
pike-perch
(fogas)
is
usually
singled
out
as
the
tastiest
of
all
Fishermen
operate
from
shore
from
boats
and
from
platforms
set
little
distance
into
the
lake
Ice-ï¬shing
has
been
popular
since
the
earliest
times
when
winter
was
the
only
season
in
which
the
catch
could
be
preserved
and
sold
in
distant
parts
of
Hungary
The
frozen
lake
is
also
used
by
ice
yachtsmen
whose
wind-powered
boats
skate
at
hair-raising
speeds
across
the
frozen
lake
Agriculture
ï¬ourishes
all
along
the
circumference
of
the
lake
enhancing
the
area
with
fruit
trees
rippling
expanses
of
wheat
and
in
the
area
of
Badacsony
some
of
the
best
vineyards
in
Hungary
The
north
and
south
shores
of
the
lake
have
their
own
distinct
personalities
The
north
shore
shelves
quicker
and
in
many
places
is
less
suited
to
bathing
than
the
southern
shore
The
north
is
backed
by
hills
greenery
and
quaint
villages;
the
south
is
ï¬atter
and
has
extensive
tourist
facilities
perfect
for
the
more
hedonistic
holiday-maker
The
North
Shore
Driving
from
Budapest
and
navigating
the
lake
in
an
counter-clockwise
direction
(along
the
perimeter
Highway
71)
the
ï¬rst
settlement
of
any
size
is
at
BalatonalmÃ¡di
There
is
medieval
chapel
in
the
parish
church
but
most
people
come
here
to
enjoy
the
beachÂ âÂ the
biggest
and
one
of
the
best-equipped
along
the
northern

with

for
12,000

BalatonfÃ¼red
some
13
km
(8
miles)
farther
west
has
history
as
spa
stretching
back
to
Roman
times
The
main
square
called
GyÃ³gy
tÃ©r
(meaning
Health/Therapeutic
Square)
is
handsome
place
where
the
local
mineral
water
bubbles
up
from
the
ground
beneath
pagoda-like
well-head
On
three
sides
of
the
square
stand
grand
old
buildings:
the
18th-century
HorvÃ¡th
House
once
an
inn
now
minerâs
sanatorium;
the
Trade
Union
Sanatorium
of
1802
and
the
Cardiac
Hospital
which
has
treated
heart
patients
from
all
over
the
world
The
small
grove
in
front
of
the
square
has
number
of
trees
dedicated
by
personalities
who
have
visited
here
including
Indira
Gandhi
Just
off
the
square
is
Blaha
Lujza
utca
with
ï¬ne
1867
villa
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
is
the
best
coffee
house
on
the
lake:
Kedves
has
been
going
strong
for
two
centuries
and
once
youâve
tasted
their
chocolate
cake
youâll
understand
why
At
the
end
of
this
street
is
rotund
church
built
in
the
1840s
and
small
museum
to
the
Hungarian
author
MÃ³r
JÃ³kai
(closed
November
to
February)
It
is
not
all
cures
coffee
and
culture
here:
BalatonfÃ¼red
is
also
one
of
the
lakeâs
liveliest
resorts
bustling
by
day
and
night
One
of
the
most
attractive
spots
on
Lake
Balaton
is
the
village
of
Tihany
The
place
gives
its
name
to
peninsula
which
almost
cuts
the
lake
in
two
and
ends
at
the
ferry
point
of
Tihanyi-rÃ©v
where
there
is
Club
Med-style
camp
and
hotel
offering
gamut
of
entertainment
The
peninsula
is
unspoiled
and
protected
by
its
National
Park
status
It
even
has
its
own
small
lake
popular
with
bird-watchers
and
nature
lovers
To
the
south
are
the
domes
of
former
geysers
Tihany
is
built
high
on
hill
above
the
main
lake
and
its
principal
street
Pisky
sÃ©tÃ¡ny
(a
promenade)
has
few
charming
traditional
thatched
houses
Start
your
tour
of
the
village
below
this
point
at
the
Abbey
Church
(ApÃ¡tsÃ¡g)
which
stands
just
off
the
main
road
The
present
18th-century
Baroque
church
stands
over
an
atmospheric
crypt
almost
thousand
years
old
rare
survivor
in
land
constantly
ravaged
by
so
many
invasions
it
is
claimed
to
be
the
oldest
in
Hungary
Here
you
will
ï¬nd
the
tomb
of
King
AndrÃ¡s
(Andrew)
who
in
1055
founded
the
Benedictine
Abbey
that
once
stood
on
this
site
The
church
itself
is
being
renovated
at
present
but
even
through
the
tarpaulins
you
can
glimpse
its
rich
Baroque
carvings
and
decorative
ornamentation
Next
door
to
the
Abbey
Church
housed
in
the
old
priory
is
the
Tihany
Historical
Museum
(closed
November
to
February)
This
museum
features
regional
folk
items
and
art
three
small
rooms
where
Hungaryâs
last
king
KÃ¡roly
IV
lived
for
ï¬ve
days
in
1921
and
in
the
basement
an
atmospheric
lapidarium
containing
Roman
remains
In
front
of
the
church
King
AndrÃ¡s
is
commemorated
in
typically
offbeat
Imre
Varga
statue
wrapped
in
an
aluminium
cloak
Some
of
the
quaint
thatched
white
houses
that
run
along
Pisky
sÃ©tÃ¡ny
have
been
converted
into
an
Ethnography
Museum
(similar
to
the
one
at
Szentendre
see
page
64
but
on
much
smaller
scale)

The
name
of
the
region
of
Badacsony
is
as
inextricably
linked
with
Hungaryâs
wine
industry
as
that
of
Burgundy
or
Beaujolais
in
France
Apart
from
the
opportunity
to
sample
the
local
tipple
itâs
the
scenery
that
appeals
to
visitors
here;
the
regionâs
volcanic
past
is
evident
at
ï¬rst
sight
of
the
conical
green
hills
The
central
basalt
peak
Mount
Badacsony
the
biggest
of
all
the
extinct
volcanoes
at
437
metres
(1434
feet)
is
invariably
described
as
âcofï¬n-shaped.â
The
basalt
âorgan-pipesâ
of
SzentgyÃ¶rgyhegy
are
an
especially
ï¬ne
sight
If
you
are
feeling
fit
and
energetic
you
can
hike
up
these
hills
but
the
easy
way
is
by
car
or
by
jeep
that
shuttles
passengers
to
and
from
the
bottom
of
the
hill
to
the
wine
museum
and
three
small
museum
houses
as
well
as
scenic
points
of
interest
little
way
farther
west
set
off
the
main
road
is
the
small
settlement
of
Szigliget
The
moody
remains
of
13th-century
castle
offer
ï¬ne
views
of
the
village
and

The
last
town
on
the
north
shore
Keszthely
(pronounced
kest-hey)
was
once
owned
entirely
by
the
wealthy
Festetics
family
and
their
palace
is
one
of
Hungaryâs
most
important
Baroque
monuments
(open
all
year
round)
Here
among
selection
of
its
101
rooms
you
can
see
something
of
the
aristocratic
life
the
family
enjoyed
during
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
The
highlight
is
the
Helikon
library
claimed
to
be
the
greatest
in
the
country
and
it
alone
is
worth
the
palace
entrance
charge
(which
is
hefty
by
Hungarian
standards)

University
of
Agricultural
Sciences
museum
situated
on
BercsÃ©nyi
utca
preserves
the
memory
of
early
local

and

The
university
gives
the
town
another
focus
other
than
tourism
something
unique
among
the
lakeside
settlements
and
as
by-product
there
is
good
selection
of
bars
and
restaurants
Continuing
out
of
Keszthely
to
the
southwest
on
Highway
71
you
reach
another
good
historical
collection
The
Balaton
Museum
portrays
the
story
of
the
settlement
of
the

and
the
development
of
its
people
including
their
agriculture
and
ï¬shing
and
its
fauna
and

better
place
to

might
be
BalatonfÃ¶ldvÃ¡r
arguably
the
areaâs
most
attractive
resort
well-landscaped
around
parks
and

At
SzÃ¡ntÃ³d
the
lake
is
squeezed
to
its
narrowest
point
by
the
Tihany
peninsula
Cars
invariably
queue
here
to
make
the
ten-minute
crossing
to
the
north
shore
On
the
other
side
of
Highway
70
almost
due
south
of
the
ferry
point
is
SzÃ¡ntÃ³dpuszta
Traditional
life
on
the
countryâs
Great
Plain
(the
puszta)
is
evoked
through
some
30
buildings
dating
from
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
including
few
farm
buildings
church
and
csÃ¡rda
(rustic
restaurant)
Displays
of
horsemanship
craftsmanship
and
other
rural
activities
are
given
regularly
The
largest
town
on
the
lakeâs
south
coast
is
SiÃ³fok
This
fairly
popular
tourist
spot
boasts
strand
which
holds
thousands
of
sunbathers
and
lively
nightlife
Pleasure
craft
depart
from
the
large
harbour
but
the
most
pleasant
stretch
of
waterfront
is
the

immediately
east
of

Where
to
Go
CancÃºn
When
the
Mexican
government
decided
to
improve
its
economy
by
developing
its
tourist
industry
totally
new
tailor-made
high-class
resort
was
the
aim;
the
major
decision
was
where
its
site
should
be
Many
factors
were
taken
into
account
before
short
list
of
locations
was
entered
into
computer
When
the
final
results
were
correlated
CancÃºn
was
top
of
the
list
This
location
had
many
natural
attributes
in
its
favor
Twenty-seven
kilometers
(17
miles)
long
and
less
than
kilometer
wide
the
island
is
shaped
like
the
number
seven
and
separated
from
the
YucatÃ¡n
peninsula
by
only
10
(33
ft)
of
water
Its
eastern
shoreline
is
one
long
beach
of
fine
white
sand
(there
are
seven
named
beaches
along
the
strip)
which
is
washed
by
the
translucent
azure
waters
of
the
Caribbean
Between
the
island
and
the
mainland
is
Laguna
NichuptÃ©
huge
seawater
lagoon
bounded
by
mangrove
swamps
that
are
havens
to
numerous
species
of
wildlife
Today
string
of
hotels
have
taken
much
of
the
beachfront
real
estate;
the
balance
given
over
to
bars
nightclubs
and
shopping
malls
On
the
lagoon
side
watersports
and
eco-tours
abound
in
the
calmer
shallow
waters
Blue
signs
denote
public
beach
access
and
there
are
no
restrictions
so
you
can
walk
the
islandâs
full
length
without
concerns
about
trespass
All
in
all
CancÃºn
has
everything
needed
for
the
perfect
relaxing
vacation
Finding
your
way
around
the
resort
couldnât
be
simpler
There
is
only
one
main
thoroughfare
KukulkÃ¡n
Boulevard
running
the
full
length
of
the
island
and
every
hotel
and
attraction
is
only
few
strides
from
it
The
addresses
of
most
hotels
or
restaurants
will
include
their
position
on
KukulkÃ¡n
Boulevard
in
kilometers;
the
farther
south
the
bigger
the
number
This
guide
explores
the
island
from
north
to
south
giving
the
exact
location
of
attractions
in
kilometers
to
make
it
easy
for
you
to
find
what
you
need
You
could
rent
vehicle
of
some
sort
to
travel
back
and
forth
to
your
hotel
but
there
is
very
reliable
and
inexpensive
bus
service
stopping
regularly
and
usually
directly
outside
the
major
hotels
at
intervals
along
the
route
The
buses
run
from
early
morning
to
midnight
Crossing
from
the
mainland
onto
the
islandÂ âÂ into
the
area
called
the
Hotel
ZoneÂ âÂ the
lagoon
with
its
rich
mangrove
forest
is
on
the

or
jet-ski
convoy
on
the
lookout
for
wildlife
such
as
herons
pelicans
deer
wild
boar
even
the
occasional
crocodileÂ âÂ though
the
local
creatures
tend
to
only
be
found
in
the
most
remote
parts
of
the
mangrove
well
away
from
humans
Between
the
lagoon
and
the
road
is
narrow
grassy
area
called
the
Parque
de
las
Artes
with
topiary
and
large
boulders
sitting
on
the
pristine
lawns
and
shaded

bit
more
energetic
on

of
the
road
there
is
wide
cycling
in-line
skating
and
jogging
track
for
much
of
the
length
of

part
of
CancÃºn
has
the
calmest
sea
for
swimming
and
snorkeling
lying
as
it
does
in
the

of
the
Hilton
CancÃºn
Golf
Resort
An
occasional
stray
ball
is
found
within
the
archaeological
site;
the
guides
will
joke
that
it
was
the
Maya
not
the
Scots
who
invented
the
game
The
El
Rey
buildings
are
not
large
by
Mayan
standards
The
temples
were
built
in

just
few
kilometers
away
an
area
that
was
developed
concurrently
with

and
visitors
aboard
Isla
Mujeres
Isla
MujeresÂ (Island
of
the
Women)
lies
only
km
(5
miles)
offshore
from
CancÃºn;
the
40-minute
ferry
ride
transports
you
from
an
ultra-modern
atmosphere
to
an
environment
in
which
time
moves
more
slowly
Several
companies
offer
one-day

often
including
lunch
and
snorkeling;
they

now
has
population
of
around
15,000

One
main
road
forms
an

following
the
shape
of

As
afternoon
turns
to
evening
and
the
day-trippers
head
back
to

Isla
Mujeres
takes
on
much
quieter
character
The
island
has
many
loyal
fans
that
return
year
after
year
for
its
particular
atmosphere
Many
who
choose
to
stay
come
for

usually
means
low-key
entertainment
and
early
nights
few
minutesâ
walk
north
of
town
is
the
main
beach
Playa
Norte
also
known
as
Coco
Beach
It
has
sheltered
waters
and
fine
sand
particularly
suitable
for
children
Coconut
palms
provide
shade
and
few
pelicans
fly
overhead
in
search
of
meal
Heading
south
out
of
town
youâll
pass
the
Mexican
naval
base
and
small
commercial
airstrip
before
traveling
alongside
Laguna
Makax
on
the
right
The
water
here
guarded
from
the
Caribbean
Sea
by
the
island
itself
has
been
used
for
centuries
as
safe
harbor
during
storms
and
hurricanes
Pirate
fleets
stopped
here
because
passing
naval
vessels
would
not
see
their
ships
On
the
far
side
of
Laguna
Mekax
is
Tortugranja
Turtle
Farm
which
has
played
major
role
in
protecting
six
species
of
the
endangered
marine
creatures
and
trying
to
build
their
numbers
Every
year
nest
sites
are
protected
and
number
of
eggs
removed
The
hatchlings
are
cared
for
until
they
are
year
old
and
then
returned
to
the
ocean
You
can
see
the
young
turtles
throughout
the
year
but
the
best
time
to
visit
the
farm
is
during
egg-laying
season;
from
May
through
September
it
is
possible
to
visit
the
nest
sites
and
watch
the
turtles
laying
eggs
Heading
south
on
the
coast
there
are
numerous
small
hotels
and
guest-houses
catering
to
divers
Just
offshore
coral
reef
in
shallow
water
has
become
one
of
the
major
diving
and
snorkeling
venues
in
the
world
Although
the
inner
reefs
were
damaged
in
the
early
years
of
their
popularity
they
are
now
protected
under
the
auspices
of
the
National
Park
service
as
El
GarrafÃ³n/Punta
Sur
Park
Jacques
Cousteau
made
El
GarrafÃ³n
famous
in
the
1960s
when
he
filmed
the
nurse
sharks
in
their
caves
in
the
park
You
can
still
find
them
at
the
Cave
of
the
Sleeping
Sharks
and
experienced
divers
can
swim
with
themÂ âÂ not
as
frightening
as
you
would
think
as
nurse
sharks
are
not
dangerous
to
humansÂ âÂ in
their
dark
watery
hideouts
Non-certified
divers
who
want
the
chance
can
swim
with
the
sharks
at
El
GarrafÃ³n
pier
where
several
sharks
are
kept
in
pens
for
this
purpose
The
marine
life
is
truly
spectacular
at
the
park
both
in
the
shallow
and
the
outer
reef
areas
The
land
around
the
southern
tip
of
the
island
is
also
protected;
Punta
Sur
is
wind-swept
salty
spot
where
the
waves
of
the
Caribbean
crash
onto
the
rocks
The
remains
of
Mayan
temple
can
be
seen
here
along
with
lighthouse
that
guides
sailors
safely
to
port
to
this
day
Cozumel
Cozumel
was
also
brought
to
the
worldâs
attention
by
Jacques
Cousteauâs
diving
films
of
the
1960s
With
the
second-longest
coral
reef
in
the
world
just
off
its
western
coastline
it
soon
became
haunt
for
all
those
who
enjoyed
the
underwater
world
Today
along
with
enjoying
status
as
one
of
the
premier
dive
islands
in
the
world
it
is
also
duty-free
cruise
port
with
shopping
to
match
the
best
in
the
Caribbean
However
Cozumel
has
much
longer
history
of
human
habitation
It
was
Mayan
site
of
some
importance
being
the
center
of
worship
for
the
fertility
goddess
Ix-chel
Cozumel
became
destination
for
Mayan
pilgrims
from
all
over
YucatÃ¡n
in
the
late
and
post-classical
periods
(a.d
900â1650)
The
Maya
who
lived
here
traded
salt
and
honey
all
along
the
coast;
Xcaret
was
their
major
port
on
the
mainland
The
Spanish
conducted
the
first
Catholic
mass
in
Mexico
here
after
their
arrival
in
1518
but
they
had
little
interest
in
the
island
It
remained
almost
uninhabited
through
the
18th
century
But
following
the
War
of
the
Castes
in
1847â1848
several
rebel
families
settled
here
to
escape
retribution
by
colonial
landowners
on
the
Yucatecan
mainland
They
eked
out
simple
living
for
decades
until
the
invention
of
the
scuba
tank
And
the
rest
as
they
say
is
history!
Cozumel
has
multiple
personalities;
it
caters
to
divers
who
go
to
bed
early
and
rise
with
the
sun
yet
it
also
has
occasionally
raucous
nightlife
for
those
who
want
to
stay
out
and
party
Those
who
know
the
island
well
refer
to
this
phenomenon
as
the
âwetâ
side
and
the
âdryâ
side
Day-trippers
who
arrive
on
their
huge
floating
cruise
shipsÂ âÂ or
on
daily
ferries
from
Playa
del
CarmenÂ âÂ add
an
extra
dimension;
they
want
to
see
everything
in
few
hours
so
the
slow
routine
of
island
life
speeds
up
when
they
arrive
There
is
only
one
settlement
the
capital
on
Cozumel
San
Miguel
de
Cozumel;
itâs
bustling
town
chock-full
of
souvenir
shops
duty-free
emporiums
bars
and
assorted
cafÃ©s
and
restaurants
If
you
arrive
on
the
island
by
ferry
from
the
mainland
youâll
be
dropped
off
directly
opposite
the
heart
of
the
downtown
area
Plaza
del
Sol
also
called
the
zÃ³calo
This
large
tree-lined
square
is
where
everyone
meets
for
coffee
or
lunch
at
one
of
the
cafÃ©s
nearby
Several
streets
surrounding
the
square
are
traffic-free
and
you
can
stroll
at
your
leisure
among
the
stores
selling
T-shirts
pottery
onyx
and
silver
The
storeowners
have
practiced
line
and
can
be
pretty
persuasive
so
it
pays
to
have
sense
of
humorÂ âÂ or
few
words
of
Spanish
so
you
can
join
in
the
banter
The
street
running
along
the
seafront
is
Avenida
Rafael
Melgar
also
known
as
the
MalecÃ³n
almost
constantly
busy
with
traffic
It
is
lined
with
numerous
duty-free
stores
selling
fragrances
designer
clothing
and
jewelry
and
gemstones
Above
these
are
bars
and
restaurants
that
keep
the
street
buzzing
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
Stop
in
at
the
Museo
de
la
Isla
de
Cozumel
(Museum
of
the
Island
of
Cozumel)
on
Avenida
Melgar
which
displays
some
interesting
artifacts
found
on
the
island
and
salvaged
from
wrecks
around
its
shores
The
two
main
rooms
on
the
first
floor
offer
simple
explanations
about
the
geology
of
the
YucatÃ¡n
peninsula
and
the
development
of
coral
reefs
offshore
The
second-floor
rooms
tell
the
story
of
Cozumelâs
history
from
ancient
Mayan
carvings
to
conquistador
helmets
and
swords
There
is
also
room
dedicated
to
the
families
who
settled
in
Cozumel
in
the
19th
centuryÂ âÂ after
the
War
of
the
CastesÂ âÂ and
who
have
developed
the
island
since
that
time
Traveling
around
the
island
couldnât
be
simpler
There
is
one
main
highway
which
follows
the
western
coastline
travels
around
the
southern
tip
and
returns
up
the
east
coast
It
then
cuts
across
the
island
at
its
widest
point
back
to
town
The
northwest
section
of
the
island
is
inaccessible
by
most
rental
vehicles
(you
may
find
clause
in
your
contract
forbidding
you
to
try
the
unmade
road)
This
part
of
the
island
is
haven
for
birds
and
wildlife
because
few
people
venture
here
There
are
also
few
Mayan
ruins
to
explore
North
of
town
you
will
find
the
airport
with
several
flights
daily
to
other
parts
of
Mexico
and
few
cities
in
the
US
Several
of
the
older
hotels
are
located
along
the
road
here
though
the
rocky
shoreline
has
fewer
beaches
than
in
the
south
South
of
San
Miguel
you
will
find
the
major
cruise
port
at
La
Ceiba
around
km
(2
miles)
from
town
Several
large
cruise
vessels
dock
each
week
bringing
flurry
of
activity;
taxi
drivers
increase
their
speed
to
make
the
most
of
the
business
There
is
good
beach
at
La
Ceiba
and
number
of
hotels
plus
several
dive
outfits
have
bases
hereÂ âÂ you
can
book
class
or
rent
equipment
Farther
south
in
the
ocean
offshore
the
reef
holds
the
attention
of
even
the
most
experienced
divers
because
of
its
variety
of
animal
and
coral
life
Turtles
rays
sharks
and
many
species
of
colorful
tropical
fish
can
be
found
here
many
at
reasonable
depth
for
novice
diversÂ âÂ though
the
reef
walls
are
better
left
to
those
with
experience
The
booking
office
for
Atlantis
Submarine
is
also
here;
this
mini-submersible
is
ideal
for
non-divers
allowing
glimpse
of
the
thriving
underwater
world
without
your
having
to
get
wet
South
of
the
cruise
port
the
road
(currently
in
the
process
of
being
upgraded)
leads
away
from
the
urban
development
and
out
into
the
countryside
This
part
of
the
island
has
some
of
the
best
and
most
sheltered
beaches
In
recent
years
number
of
excellent
resort
hotels
have
been
built
on
large
plots
of
land;
you
will
see
their
gated
entrances
as
you
drive
by
Next
to
these
are
the
more
modest
accommodations
that
for
years
have
catered
to
dedicated
divers
Around
km
(3
miles)
from
town
you
will
find
the
entrance
to
Chankanaab
State
Park
This
was
one
of
the
first
sites
on
the
island
to
offer
organized
reef
snorkeling
in
an
offshore
lagoon
though
as
it
became
more
popular
it
developed
other
attractions
Snorkeling
is
still
extremely
good
offshore
though
the
lagoon
site
is
now
devoid
of
marine
life
and
is
used
simply
as
safe
swimming
area
Chankanaab
offers
botanical
garden
and
sculpture
park
displaying
native
art
from
all
areas
of
Mexico
It
has
dive
shop
beach
umbrellas
sun
beds
and
two
restaurants
Perhaps
the
prize
of
the
park
goes
to
the
âSwim
with
the
Dolphinsâ
program
The
dolphins
are
kept
in
open
water
just
offshore
and
reached
by
wooden
walkway
Small
groups
of
people
can
enter
the
water
with
the
dolphins;
an
instructor
controls
the
activities
and
exercises
South
from
Chankanaab
you
can
stop
at
number
of
fine
sandy
beaches
on
the
west
coast
The
major
sites
are
Playa
San
Francisco
Playa
del
Sol
and
Playa
Palancar
All
the
main
beaches
have
public
access
and
each
has
its
own
cafÃ©-bar
watersports
facilities
and
lockers
for
beachgoers
The
water
is
beautiful
clear
turquoise
color;
you
will
see
small
dive
or
snorkel
boats
bobbing
offshore
as
you
soak
up
the
sun
These
waters
offer
some
of
the
best
diving
and
snorkeling
in
the
world
The
variety
of
sea-life
living
on
and
around
the
coral
reef
here
is
amazing
with
many
of
the
largest
migratory
fish
species
paying
visit
at
different
times
of
the
year
In
order
to
protect
the
delicate
environment
around
the
reef
the
Cozumel
Reefs
National
Park
was
created
in
July
1996
covering
over
80%
of
the
dive
sites
off
the
island
in
its
11,987
hectares
(29,620
acres)
There
is
US$2
daily
charge
to
dive
in
the
park
Between
Playa
del
Sol
and
Playa
Palancar
you
will
see
dirt
road
marked
by
an
arch
printed
with
the
words
El
Cedral
that
veers
left
from
the
main
highway
The
road
is
poor
and
it
requires
some
patience
to
avoid
the
potholes
but
it
leads
to
El
Cedral
from
where
it
is
possible
to
ride
horse
to
Mayan
ruins
deep
in
the
forest
(take
insect
repellent
if
you
intend
to
make
the
journey)
It
was
at
El
Cedral
that
the
first
Catholic
Mass
was
said
in
Mexico
on
May
1518
In
May
each
year
the
settlement
re-enacts
the
event
and
also
holds
fiesta
with
horseback
riding
music
and
dancing
The
very
southern
tip
of
the
island
is
national
park
protected
from
the
development
which
threatened
its
wild
but
fragile
environment
The
Parque
Punta
Sur
(South
Point
Park)
was
opened
in
August
1999
Access
is
not
permitted
by
car
but
the
park
provides
electric
bicycles
buggies
and
colorful
open-sided
tour
bus
to
give
access
to
the
interior;
two
hours
of
free
cycle
use
is
included
with
the
entry
ticket
Next
to
the
car
park
where
you
leave
your
vehicle
and
information
center
provides
details
about
the
park
and
its
flora
and
fauna
Within
Punta
Surâs
1,100
hectares
(2,718
acres)
are
the
coast
with
its
wild
beaches
and
sand
dunes
and
the
interior
lagoons
and
mangrove
swamps
with
population
of
crocodiles
and
bird
species
You
can
explore
Punta
Celerain
the
most
southerly
point
of
Cozumel
and
now
part
of
the
park
and
Punta
Celerain
Lighthouse
once
protector
of
shipping
in
the
area
and
now
refurbished
to
house
the
Museo
de
la
NavegaciÃ³n
(Navigation
Museum)
series
of
dioramas
in
both
Spanish
and
English
explain
navigation
methods
through
the
ages
including
those
of
the
Maya
who
lived
in
the
region
One
room
in
the
museum
is
dedicated
to
the
lighthouse-keepers
and
their
families
who
lived
here
full
time
often
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
population
in
San
Miguel
From
Punta
Sur
the
main
highway
heads
north
up
the
eastern
coastline
The
conditions
here
offer
quite
contrast
to
the
west
with
the
waves
of
the
Caribbean
lashing
against
limestone
rocks
and
the
low
vegetation
leaning
inward
blown
by
the
sea
breezes
The
whole
area
has
stark
and
wild
beauty
reminiscent
perhaps
of
the
time
when
Cozumel
was
the
haunt
of
pirates
and
renegades
The
tidal
surge
is
very
strong
here
so
swimming
and
snorkeling
are
not
advised
Other
than
few
farms
there
is
little
development
until
you
reach
Playa
Morena
with
its
bar
and
souvenir
stand
Here
the
road
makes
sharp
left
turn
to
cut
across
the
heart
of
the
island
If
you
wish
to
continue
north
from
here
(on
foot
horseback
or
four-wheel
drive
vehicle)
you
will
eventually
reach
the
northern
lighthouse
at
Punta
Molas
having
passed
the
Mayan
ruins
of
El
Castillo
Real
along
the
way
Take
the
sensible
precautions
if
you
make
this
tripÂ âÂ drinking
water
sun
protection
insect
repellent
and
an
extra
layer
of
clothing
are
all
advisable
The
road
leading
back
to
San
Miguel
called
the
Carretera
Transversal
hosts
few
souvenir
stands
where
prices
may
be
little
lower
than
in
townÂ âÂ if
youâre
prepared
to
barter
Six
km
(4
miles)
from
Playa
Morena
is
the
entrance
to
the
San
Gervasio
Archaeological
Park
The
remains
of
San
Gervasio
are
located
several
kilometers
from
the
site
entrance
and
though
not
on
the
scale
of
the
major
Mayan
settlements
of
the
mainland
the
beautiful
tropical
park
environment
makes
the
ruins
worth
exploring
Most
structures
date
from
the
post-classical
period
(1200â1650);
the
site
was
still
in
use
when
the
Spanish
arrived
At
the
Estructura
Manitas
(Little
Hands
Structure)
you
can
clearly
see
the
red
handprints
dating
from
around
1000
on
the
inside
wall
of
the
temple
From
here
you
can
walk
the
route
of
short
sacred
sacbÃ©
(Mayan
road)
to
the
central
collection
of
small
buildings
One
is
El
Osario
(Ossuary
Structure)
where
the
remains
of
several
Maya
were
found
Some
500
(1,524
ft)
behind
here
is
Kana
Nah
(Tall
House)
which
as
its
name
suggests
is
one
of
the
largest
structures
at
the
site
It
was
the
main
temple
where
the
goddess
Ix
chel
was
worshipped
South
to
Tulum
along
theMaya
Riviera
When
tourism
first
came
to
this
area
of
the
YucatÃ¡n
peninsula
the
coastline
between
CancÃºn
and
Tulum
was
pristine
natural
landscape
broken
only
by
few
villages
Rocky
coastal
inlets
where
sea-water
mingles
with
the
fresh
water
of
several
cenotes
are
separated
by
acres
of
virgin
mangrove
Parts
of
the
coastline
have
sandy
beaches
that
seem
as
if
no
human
has
ever
set
foot
on
them
Of
course
with
the
success
of
CancÃºn
developers
have
looked
for
other
opportunities
in
the
region
and
this
stretch
of
coastline
is
gradually
being
taken
for
tourist
development
Luckily
not
every
development
mimics
the
grand
resorts
of
CancÃºn
and
there
is
some
variety
here
in
both
style
and
atmosphere;
there
are
number
of
all-inclusive
hotel
complexes
yet
there
are
also
interesting
towns
and
ports
Tulum
with
its
magnificent
Mayan
ruins
forms
natural
southerly
point
to
the
strip
of
coastal
development
which
has
been
given
the
name
âThe
Maya
Riviera.â
The
area
is
easy
to
explore
by
vehicle
as
the
road
following
the
coastlineÂ âÂ though
in
some
places
few
kilometers
inland
from
itÂ âÂ is
in
good
condition;
around
half
is
four-lane
highway
opened
in
1998
There
is
also
an
excellent
bus
service
linking
the
major
settlements
and
large
hotels
which
takes
around
two
hours
to
run
the
whole
length
of
the
Riviera
Traveling
south
from
CancÃºn
the
first
town
you
will
pass
at
36
km
(22
miles)
is
Puerto
Morelos
the
port
for
vehicle
ferries
to
the
island
of
Cozumel
thirty-minute
journey
from
CancÃºn
is
Tres
RÃ­os
natural
reserve
with
facilities
for
snorkeling
kayaking
and
horseback
riding
Further
south
Playa
del
Carmen
once
tiny
settlement
is
now
the
fastest
growing
resort
in
the
area
For
many
years
Playa
was
simply
stepping-stone
to
Cozumel
only
40-minute
boat
ride
awayÂ âÂ in
fact
the
hotels
along
Cozumelâs
coastline
can
clearly
be
seen
from
the
town
jetty
But
the
town
sitting
on
wonderful
pale-sand
beach
with
clear
bright
azure
water
has
become
an
attraction
in
itself
It
now
boasts
several
large
hotels
and
pretty
traffic-free
street
one
block
west
of
the
strand
Calle
5
where
the
souvenir
stores
cafÃ©s
and
bars
spill
out
into
the
street
As
day
turns
to
night
music
from
rock
to
reggae
floats
in
the
air
All
this
gives
the
town
rather
bohemian
atmosphere
Beyond
Playa
the
coastline
is
most
dramatic;
the
limestone
has
been
eroded
into
several
coastal
inlets
lagoons
and
riverbeds
This
stretch
is
excellent
for
snorkeling
and
has
some
exciting
cenotes
for
diving
and
swimming;
as
well
number
of
these
inlets
have
been
protected
as
national
parks
or
developed
as
pleasure
playgrounds
for
tourists
Around
10
km
(6
miles)
south
of
Playa
del
Carmen
Xcaret
(pronounced
shkaret)
is
the
largest
and
the
most
organized
resort
with
range
of
activities
and
facilities
to
enjoy
Xcaret
or
âlittle
inlet,â
is
an
award-winning
example
of
sustainable
tourist
development
Once
the
site
of
an
ancient
Mayan
port
for
departures
to
Cozumel
the
sheltered
lagoon
was
the
perfect
protection
for
Mayan
canoes
The
waters
of
the
nearby
cenote
were
used
for
ritual
purification
before
pilgrims
made
the
short
sea
journey
to
the
Temple
of
Ix-chelÂ âÂ the
goddess
of
fertility
and
childbirth
The
remains
of
several
temples
can
be
found
in
the
park
grounds
When
Xcaret
opened
in
1990
the
cenote
and
its
outlet
to
the
sea
(a
mixture
of
narrow
gorge
and
underground
tunnel)
were
the
focus
of
the
park;
they
made
an
exciting
snorkeling
or
swimming
tour
Today
this
is
still
popular
attraction
but
the
park
has
grown
to
include
sheltered
swimming
beautiful
beach
restaurants
tropical
gardens
horseback-riding
trails
magnificent
butterfly
pavilion
zoo
an
aquarium
and
âswim
with
the
dolphinsâ
program
The
park
is
also
contributing
to
number
of
projects
protecting
endangered
plants
and
animals
including
the
green
turtle
and
several
parrot
species
As
night
falls
Xcaret
holds
number
of
âspectacularsâ
which
are
both
entertaining
and
educational
Mayan
rituals
are
re-enacted
at
the
ancient
sites
and
folkloric
ballet
offers
traditional
dances
from
different
regions
in
Mexico
Puerto
Aventuras
is
an
interesting
development
unlike
any
place
else
on
the
Maya
Riviera
The
rocky
coastal
inlets
have
been
transformed
into
magnificent
marina
with
mooring
for
yachts
and
motor
launches
and
walkway
along
the
waterside
Sympathetic
two-
and
three-story
pastel
painted
buildings
line
the
marina
with
restaurants
at
ground
level
The
whole
area
has
the
feel
of
the
Italian
or
French
Rivera
rather
than
Caribbean
Mexico
At
the
center
of
the
resort
in
the
sheltered
waters
of
the
inner
lagoon
there
is
âSwim
with
the
Dolphinsâ
program
Just
beside
the
dolphin
pools
is
Museo
CEDAM
(Club
de
ExploraciÃ³n
Deporte
AcuÃ¡tico
de
MÃ©xico)
which
is
dedicated
to
number
of
pioneers
of
underwater
archaeology
and
exploration
The
museum
has
wooden
floor
covered
in
sand
which
adds
touch
of
the
nautical
as
you
wander
among
the
exhibits
Interesting
finds
from
the
ocean
floorÂ âÂ Mayan
Spanish-colonial
and
more
modern
artifactsÂ âÂ combine
with
displays
of
early
diving
equipment
You
will
also
see
stunning
photographs
of
underwater
environments
taken
by
leading
practicians
of
the
art
Just
south
of
Puerto
Aventuras
is
Xel-Ha
network
of
mangrove
waterways
pools
and
caves
that
was
once
Mayan
site
The
majority
of
the
remains
form
an
archaeological
site
on
the
inland
side
of
the
main
highway;
Xel-Ha
Park
sits
on
the
seaward
side
This
park
has
more
natural
areas
than
Xcaret
for
snorkeling
and
exploring
but
fewer
organized
activities
though
there
is
âswim
with
the
dolphinsâ
program
At
either
side
of
this
managed
park
are
public
inlets;
at
Akumal
you
can
snorkel
just
off
the
sand
or
rent
boat
to
take
you
out
to
the
reef
Tulum
is
the
most
southerly
destination
of
the
convoy
of
tourist
buses
departing
daily
from
CancÃºn
Buses
and
cars
park
some
700
(1â2
mile)
from
the
entrance
shuttle
bus
will
carry
passengers
to
the
entrance
for
US$1
if
you
donât
feel
energetic
enough
for
the
walk
The
Mayan
ruins
here
are
magnet
for
visitors
both
for
their
architectural
significance
and
their
beautiful
setting
being
the
only
site
fronting
the
open
sea
Tulum
was
built
late
in
Mayan
history
during
the
12th
century
and
was
still
thriving
in
the
15th
and
16th
centuries
when
other
Mayan
sites
had
been
abandoned
This
was
time
of
great
upheaval
so
the
Maya
built
their
temples
close
together
and
surrounded
them
with
strong
defensive
wallÂ âÂ the
name
Tulum
actually
means
âwalledâ
or
âfenced.â
The
walls
acted
as
defense
later
in
Mayan
history
during
the
War
of
the
Castes
(1847)
when
several
rebel
Maya
brought
their
families
to
hide
out
here
There
are
no
great
structures
on
the
scale
of
those
at
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡
or
Uxmal
but
several
sit
on
rocky
outcrops
overlooking
the
fine
sandy
beach
and
clear
blue
water
below
making
the
place
photographerâs
delight
Chief
among
these
is
El
Castillo
(the
Castle)
the
main
temple
Tulum
was
dedicated
to
the
worship
of
the
Descending
God
who
can
be
seen
in
carvings
and
stucco
reliefs
on
El
Castillo
and
other
buildings
at
the
siteÂ âÂ though
many
details
have
been
lost
to
the
elements
and
the
salt
air
He
is
depicted
as
winged
figure
head
below
and
two
feet
above
It
is
not
clear
what
this
godâs
role
was
within
Mayan
worship;
he
may
represent
the
setting
sun
as
many
temples
at
the
site
including
El
Castillo
face
west
few
steps
northwest
of
El
Castillo
is
Templo
del
Dios
Descendente
(The
Temple
of
the
Descending
God)
of
note
because
it
was
deliberately
built
with
walls
and
doors
out
of
plumb
Between
the
site
entrance
and
El
Castillo
the
Templo
de
los
Frescos
(Temple
of
the
Frescoes
or
Paintings)
has
the
best-preserved
reliefs
at
the
site
and
rather
worn
stela
fronting
the
main
faÃ§ade
At
each
corner
of
the
west-facing
wall
it
is
possible
to
discern
somber
mask
with
large
eyes
and
lipsÂ âÂ possibly
depiction
of
KukulkÃ¡n
Above
the
columned
entrance
are
three
niches
each
with
relief
of
the
Descending
God
at
the
center
Red
handprints
decorate
the
small
upper
room
and
inside
there
are
fine
frescoes
dating
from
the
13th
century
but
it
is
not
possible
to
enter
the
temple
to
see
them
You
can
sunbathe
on
the
beach
at
the
site;
some
Mexican
families
spend
the
day
here
something
the
Maya
would
never
have
been
able
to
do
when
it
was
religious
center
Only
those
who
belonged
to
the
upper
and
religious
castes
were
allowed
into
its
inner
sanctum
Downtown
Tulum
has
the
decided
feeling
of
frontier
town
and
beyondÂ âÂ towards
the
state
capital
ChetumalÂ âÂ the
road
is
in
worse
condition
than
farther
north
Two
kilometers
(about
mile)
east
of
downtown
along
the
coast
hotel
zone
is
being
developed
for
those
who
want
spend
longer
than
day
in
the
region
to
explore
the
less
populated
areas
such
as
Sian
Kaâan
Biosphere
Reserve
to
the
south
Inland
from
Tulum
is
another
Mayan
site
worthy
of
note
CobÃ¡
sits
surrounded
by
jungle
some
42
km
(26
miles)
from
Tulum
on
the
banks
of
Lake
CobÃ¡
It
is
one
of
the
largest
Mayan
sites
said
by
archaeologists
to
be
100
square
km
(39
square
miles)
in
area
and
encompasses
around
20,000
separate
structuresÂ âÂ though
most
have
not
been
excavated
It
is
thought
that
at
its
peak
(a.d
800â100)
it
was
one
of
the
most
important
cities
in
the
Mayan
kingdom
with
network
of
roads
reaching
to
many
satellite
settlements
some
up
to
100
km
(62
miles)
away
At
CobÃ¡
it
is
possible
to
feel
little
as
Stephens
and
Catherwood
did
when
they
discovered
the
Mayan
sites
in
their
expeditions
of
1841
Most
of
the
pyramids
and
temples
still
lie
under
centuries
of
debris
and
vegetation
tantalizing
visitors
with
intricate
carvings
peeking
through
roots
and
branches
Here
you
can
imagine
yourself
to
be
exploring
where
no
one
except
the
abundant
birds
and
butterflies
has
been
for
centuries
CobÃ¡
more
than
any
other
site
requires
sensible
footwear
hat
sunscreen
and
bottled
water
because
the
principal
structures
are
spread
so
widely
apart
The
main
building
at
the
site
is
the
Iglesia
or
church
huge
pyramid
nearly
30
(90
ft)
high
It
sits
among
number
of
structures
known
as
the
Grupo
CobÃ¡
which
lie
to
the
right
of
the
main
entrance
Its
major
staircase
has
been
cleared
and
the
view
from
the
top
is
spectacular
with
the
lakes
and
jungle
stretching
out
to
cover
the
land
At
irregular
intervals
vegetation-covered
mounds
indicate
other
pyramids
yet
to
be
freed
The
only
other
large
structure
in
view
is
the
stone
faÃ§ade
of
Nohoch
Mul
(Big
Hill)
some
20
minutesâ
walk
away
At
42
(138
ft)
Nohoch
Mul
is
the
largest
Mayan
pyramid
yet
discovered;
there
are
120
steps
to
its
upper
platform
Once
there
you
will
find
images
of
the
Descending
GodÂ âÂ the
same
image
seen
so
often
at
Tulum
Between
the
Nohoch
Mul
group
and
Grupo
CobÃ¡
is
Conjunto
de
las
Pinturas
(Paintings
Group)
where
you
can
see
the
Pyramid
of
the
Painted
Lintel
which
as
the
name
suggests
still
bears
traces
of
its
original
coloring
West
to
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡
and
MÃ©rida
Traveling
west
out
of
the
CancÃºn
region
transports
you
almost
immediately
into
different
era
Traces
of
Spanish
colonial
life
can
be
found
across
the
landscape
but
more
than
this
once
out
in
the
countryside
the
life
of
the
agricultural
worker
very
much
resembles
that
lived
by
Maya
in
centuries
past
Today
they
still
produce
numerous
crops
on
small
farms
but
large
modern
ranchesÂ are
much
more
common
in
the
last
hundred
years
than
before
Two
highways
travel
west:
the
four-lane
toll
highway
carries
traffic
halfway
across
the
YucatÃ¡n
peninsula
in
around
three
hours;
the
local
road
(in
good
condition)
travels
through
the
countryside
and
many
local
settlements
which
allows
the
opportunity
to
view
the
daily
life
of
the
region
Both
roads
are
numbered
180
but
the
local
road
is
signposted
â180
libreâ
(meaning
free)
The
first
major
town
on
the
180
libre
is
Valladolid
Founded
in
1543
it
has
YucatÃ¡nâs
oldest
church
San
Bernadino
de
Siena
(1552)
now
outshone
by
the
imposing
Catedral
de
San
Gervasio
in
the
main
square
North
of
Valladolid
on
route
295
are
the
remains
of
the
Mayan
city
of
EkbalÃ¡m
one
of
the
most
recent
sites
to
benefit
from
major
archaeological
attention
Original
stucco
can
still
be
found
on
the
faÃ§ade
of
the
Great
Temple
here
and
this
has
been
augmented
to
show
how
it
would
have
appeared
at
the
zenith
of
the
cityâs
development
This
helps
to
gain
better
understanding
of
how
other
Mayan
buildings
once
looked
at
sites
such
as
Tulum
Beyond
Valladolid
are
the
Grutas
de
BalancanchÃ©
(BalancanchÃ©
Caves)
which
were
only
rediscovered
in
1959
after
being
abandoned
by
the
Maya
The
huge
caverns
with
underground
lakes
were
place
of
offering
and
evidence
of
incense
burning
can
still
be
found
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡
Three
hours
of
traveling
will
bring
you
to
the
small
town
of
PistÃ©
and
the
remains
of
one
of
the
most
famous
Mayan
sites
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡
has
fired
the
imagination
of
archaeologists
and
tourists
alike
No
matter
how
many
other
people
happen
to
be
there
when
you
visit
you
cannot
help
but
be
impressed
by
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡
It
has
been
well
excavated
and
the
huge
range
of
structures
give
lasting
impression
of
how
life
would
have
been
lived
by
the
Mayan
elite
The
city
was
built
late
in
the
empireâs
cycle
between
the
sixth
and
ninth
centuries
(the
post-Classic
period)
Despite
large
amount
of
research
scientists
are
still
not
in
agreement
as
to
exactly
how
the
city
evolved
and
what
influences
came
to
bear
What
is
certain
is
that
Toltec
influences
in
the
form
of
the
god
KukulkÃ¡n
(Quetzalcoatl)
and
Chaac-Mool
reliefs
can
be
found
here
along
with
traditional
Mayan
symbols
Another
mystery
yet
to
be
solved
is
why
the
Toltec
abandoned
the
city
in
1200
Some
time
later
in
the
13th
century
the
ItzÃ¡
Mayan
tribe
led
by
ruler
named
ItzÃ¡mna
moved
north
out
of
what
is
now
the
Campeche
province
to
the
tip
of
YucatÃ¡n
and
settled
in
the
city
They
gave
the
city
the
name
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡;
this
probably
means
âMouth
of
the
Well
of
the
ItzÃ¡s.â
They
founded
capital
at
Mayapan
near
the
site
of
the
modern
city
of
MÃ©rida
In
the
15th
century
following
bloody
civil
war
the
ItzÃ¡s
abandoned
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡
It
had
already
been
reclaimed
by
the
jungle
when
the
Spanish
set
foot
on
the
peninsula
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡
occupies
square
km
(4
square
miles)
If
you
want
to
explore
all
corners
of
the
site
visit
will
occupy
full
day
Excursions
from
CancÃºn
are
popular
but
can
be
tiring
It
is
far
better
to
stay
near
the
site
and
begin
your
visit
early
because
you
can
start
when
the
day
is
cooler
and
you
will
be
able
to
see
at
least
some
of
the
site
before
the
tour
groups
arrive
Those
who
stay
overnight
can
also
enjoy
the
sound-and-light
show
that
takes
place
each
evening
The
city
has
two
distinct
sectors
Old
ChichÃ©n
in
the
south
is
purely
Puuc-Mayan
in
style
(see
page
66)
having
chambers
with
arched
stone
roofs
New
ChichÃ©n
has
distinct
Toltec
influences;
here
stone
columns
supported
roofs
constructed
with
wooden
beams
This
allowed
rooms
in
new
ChichÃ©n
to
be
much
larger
than
in
the
older
part
of
the
site
but
it
also
meant
that
as
the
wood
rotted
the
roofs
of
the
chambers
collapsed
leaving
these
structures
much
less
intact
in
the
present
day
You
can
visit
the
site
unaccompanied
or
hire
guide
at
the
entrance;
they
charge
around
$30
for
group
of
up
to
six
people
You
will
also
find
book
and
gift
store
restaurant
and
museum
with
finds
from
the
site
and
model
of
the
city
to
help
you
to
get
your
bearings
As
you
enter
the
site
(in
the
new
part
of
the
city)
the
huge
square
edifice
of
El
Castillo
also
called
the
Pyramid
of
KukulkÃ¡n
comes
into
view
on
your
right
The
pyramid
30
(100
ft)
high
and
the
main
time-keeping
mechanism
of
the
city
was
built
very
precisely
in
position
shape
and
height
in
order
to
predict
the
planting
and
harvesting
cycles
There
are
364
steps
in
four
staircases
which
together
represent
the
365
days
of
the
year
There
are
52
panels
on
each
side
which
echo
the
52-year
cycle
of
the
Mayan
calendar
and
terraces
that
parallel
the
main
staircase
representing
the
18-month
solar
cycle
The
best
time
to
see
this
super-sized
timepiece
in
action
is
at
the
Spring
Equinox
(21
March)
or
Fall
Equinox
(21
September)
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sunâs
rays
fall
down
the
northern
stairway
and
hit
the
serpent
head
at
the
base
With
the
play
of
light
and
shadow
the
serpent
appears
to
wriggle
down
into
the
earth
For
the
Maya
this
signified
the
re-fertilization
of
the
landÂ âÂ and
time
to
plant
the
corn
The
light
then
leaves
the
snake
head
first
and
travels
back
up
from
the
base;
the
Maya
believed
that
the
power
of
the
sun
was
returning
to
the
realm
of
the
gods
in
the
sky
It
is
possible
to
climb
one
of
the
steep
staircases
to
the
upper
platform
which
has
number
of
small
chambers
The
view
from
the
platform
is
spectacular;
look
down
on
other
buildings
on
the
site
and
also
out
to
the
distance
with
low
Yucatecan
jungle
stretching
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
Take
care
when
you
descend
the
staircase
as
the
treads
are
narrow
Inside
El
Castillo
are
the
foundations
of
an
earlier
structure
and
chamber
containing
the
figure
of
jaguar
decorated
with
jade
along
with
statue
of
\
the
Rain
God
To
the
left
of
the
main
entrance
is
the
huge
open
main
juego
de
pelota
(ball
court)
one
of
the
best
preserved
in
Central
America
Although
one
of
nine
on
the
site
it
is
definitely
the
most
impressive
with
walls
(26
ft)
high
83
(272
ft)
long
and
set
30
(98
ft)
apart
The
walls
are
decorated
with
friezes
showing
players
dressed
in
protective
clothing
and
rather
bloodthirsty
victor
with
the
head
of
losing
player
(though
some
archaeologists
believe
that
the
victor
had
the
âhonorâ
of
losing
his
life
at
the
end
of
the
match)
This
ball
court
has
been
well
studied
by
archaeologists;
ball
courts
can
be
found
in
most
Mesoamerican
settlements
but
the
true
purpose
of
the
games
is
still
not
fully
understood
There
are
temples
at
each
end
of
the
court
which
add
to
the
superb
acoustics:Â it
is
possible
to
hear
voice
speaking
at
one
end
clearly
at
the
other
and
the
whole
complex
has
seven-repeat
echo
sacred
number
in
Mayan
society
The
temple
attached
to
the
eastern
wall
the
Templo
de
los
Jaguares
(Temple
of
the
Jaguars)
is
named
in
honor
of
the
jaguar
figures
carved
on
the
upper
panels
of
the
temple
and
statue
of
jaguar
in
the
lower
chamber
The
carving
to
its
left
is
said
to
depict
the
Mayan
creation
myth
Next
to
the
ball
courts
is
Tzompantli
Temple
of
the
Skulls
with
long
rows
of
skulls
carved
into
its
main
platform
It
is
said
that
here
the
victims
of
sacrifice
had
their
severed
heads
impaled
on
poles
for
the
edification
of
the
gods
Beside
this
is
the
Plataforma
de
las
Ãguilas
(Platform
of
the
Eagles)
with
reliefs
of
eagles
and
jaguarsÂ clutching
human
hearts
Equidistant
between
El
Castillo
and
the
Temple
of
the
Skulls
the
Templo
de
Venus
(Temple
of
Venus)
depicts
the
goddess
as
feathered
serpent
devouring
human
head
From
the
Temple
of
Venus
sacred
causewayÂ âÂ now
little
more
than
dirt
trackÂ âÂ was
once
paved
highway
to
one
of
the
most
important
religious
sites
in
the
city
the
natural
feature
which
may
have
given
the
city
its
name
The
Cenote
Sagrado
limestone
waterhole
60
(90
ft)
in
diameter
and
21
(69
ft)
from
rim
to
water
level
was
not
fresh
water
supply
for
the
city;
it
had
much
more
chilling
use
When
archaeologists
dredged
the
hole
hundreds
of
human
bones
victims
of
the
Mayan
ritual
of
appeasement
to
the
gods
were
found
The
skeletons
of
men
women
and
children
gave
the
cenote
its
other
name
the
Well
of
Sacrifice
To
the
east
of
the
Temple
of
Venus
is
perhaps
the
most
striking
temple
on
the
site
the
Templo
de
los
Guerreros
(Temple
of
the
Warriors)
Named
for
the
reliefs
depicting
thousands
of
Mayan
warriors
the
temple
also
has
numerous
columns
putting
one
in
mind
of
classical
Greek
edifice
On
platform
above
the
columns
is
carved
figure
of
Chaac-Mool
in
reclining
position
its
belly
hollowed
into
bowl
to
receive
offeringsÂ âÂ some
experts
think
these
included
human
hearts
fresh
from
the
body
Unfortunately
at
the
present
time
the
platform
is
not
open
to
visitors
Reached
through
colonnaded
walkway
abutting
the
Temple
of
the
Warriors
is
what
modern
archaeologists
have
named
the
Mercado
or
Market
with
the
remains
of
steam
baths
and
number
of
ball
courts
Just
south
of
the
market
are
the
tracks
of
the
modern
road
(now
diverted)
that
once
cut
through
the
site
Beyond
this
are
remains
to
the
south
and
westÂ âÂ Old
ChichÃ©n
Directly
ahead
is
the
Tumba
del
Gran
Sacerdote
(Tomb
of
the
High
Priest)
built
atop
limestone
cave
where
human
sacrifices
were
carried
out
Several
small
temples
can
be
found
here
Casa
de
los
Metates
(the
House
of
the
Grinding
Stones)
is
named
after
the
corn-grinding
stones
of
the
Maya
which
are
used
in
villages
in
the
region
in
the
present
day
Several
were
found
here
when
archaeologists
investigated
the
building
Chichan-chob
(Little
Holes
also
called
Red
House)
is
an
older-style
building
in
the
Puuc
style
It
has
small
holes
in
the
roof
and
masks
of
Chaac-Mool
on
the
upper
walls
Beyond
small
ball
court
you
will
see
the
imposing
building
of
the
observatory
El
Caracol
An
important
place
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
observations
taken
here
would
predict
the
exact
times
of
the
equinoxes
and
important
celestial
events
El
Caracol
means
âthe
snailâ
in
Spanish;
it
was
given
its
name
by
explorer
John
Lloyd
Stephens
because
he
thought
that
the
spiral
staircase
on
the
inside
of
the
dome
mimicked
the
chamber
of
snail
shell
Edificio
de
las
Monjas
(Edifice
of
the
Nuns)
lying
farthest
south
is
perhaps
the
most
Puuc
in
style
(see
page
66)
of
all
the
buildings
here
It
stands
on
the
site
of
much
older
buildings
that
can
be
seen
in
the
interior
Nearby
is
building
called
surprisingly
La
Iglesia
(The
Church)
It
isnât
place
of
Christian
worshipÂ âÂ in
fact
it
is
one
of
the
oldest
buildings
on
the
site
and
pays
homage
to
the
bacah
group
of
gods
thought
to
have
held
up
the
sky
Images
of
snail
and
tortoise
can
be
seen
here
among
others
The
walls
of
Akab
Dzib
the
Temple
of
Obscure
Writing
to
the
east
of
the
Church
are
filled
with
Mayan
glyphs,Â the
written
language
of
the
peopleÂ that
has
been
the
focus
of
much
attention
and
research
in
the
last
30
years
Other
buildings
of
Old
ChichÃ©n
lie
in
the
scrubland
to
the
south
of
these
structures
but
exploration
is
more
difficult
and
you
may
benefit
from
having
guide
Izamal
Further
west
is
the
small
town
of
Izamal
The
settlement
is
known
as
âthe
city
of
three
culturesâ
because
perhaps
more
than
anywhere
in
the
region
you
can
find
Mayan
colonial
and
modern
influences
together
in
the
city
streets
At
the
heart
of
the
city
is
the
Monastery
of
San
Antonio
de
Padua
home
to
the
Franciscan
order
and
founded
by
Archbishop
de
Landa
at
the
end
of
the
16th
century
Today
there
are
ten
monks
continuing
the
tradition
though
only
their
inner
sanctum
is
out
of
bounds
leaving
you
free
to
explore
the
small
courtyards
and
chapels
In
1993
Pope
John
Paul
II
visited
the
monastery
conducting
mass
here
small
museum
has
photographs
of
his
visit
along
with
papal
throne
built
especially
for
the
occasion
The
monastery
and
buildings
on
the
surrounding
streetsÂ âÂ rows
of
old
colonial
housesÂ âÂ have
been
painted
bright
yellow
one
of
the
traditional
colors
used
by
the
Spanish
settlers
You
can
take
calesa
ride
through
the
streets
and
visit
the
remains
of
Mayan
structures
including
KinichkakmoÂ (âthe
face
of
the
maker
of
the
sunâ)
which
is
the
largest
pyramid
in
the
region
though
few
have
been
excavated
MÃ©rida
The
largest
city
on
the
YucatÃ¡n
peninsula
and
capital
of
YucatÃ¡n
state
La
Blanca
MÃ©rida
was
founded
in
the
1640s
at
the
very
start
of
the
Spanish
occupation
on
the
site
of
large
Mayan
city
TâHo
MÃ©rida
became
the
focus
of
influence
for
the
Montejo
family
who
exerted
their
force
over
the
surrounding
countryside
Since
that
time
it
has
seen
the
ebb
and
flow
of
economic
prosperity
and
political
power
yet
its
architecture
and
lifestyleÂ âÂ a
total
contrast
to
modern
CancÃºnÂ âÂ make
it
fascinating
place
to
visit
MÃ©rida
is
vibrant
bustling
city
with
tangible
energy
It
also
has
interesting
attractions
that
can
fill
few
days
of
your
itinerary
The
heart
of
the
city
is
Plaza
Major
(also
known
by
variety
of
names
such
as
Plaza
des
Armas
Plaza
Principal
Plaza
de
la
Independencia
and
Plaza
de
la
Revolucion)
Its
tree-lined
center
has
shaded
seats
where
everyone
comes
to
meet
and
talk;
shoe-shine
boys
work
throughout
the
day
while
ice-cream
sellers
stand
on
street
corners
with
their
small
barrows
Look
out
for
the
confidenciales
or
love
seats
where
courting
couples
could
sit
next
to
each
other
without
compromising
the
womanâs
reputation
In
the
center
of
the
square
is
flagpole
supporting
Mexican
flag
which
is
raised
and
lowered
at
the
start
and
end
of
each
day
(6am
and
6pm)
in
an
elaborate
ceremony
undertaken
by
the
local
police
band
Numerous
historic
buildings
dating
back
to
the
very
earliest
days
of
Spanish
rule
line
the
square
and
its
surrounding
grid
of
streets
Construction
of
many
of
these
buildings
used
stones
from
the
Mayan
city
of
TâHo
so
alas
nothing
remains
of
this
site
Perhaps
the
most
important
building
is
Palacio
de
Montejo
on
the
south
side
of
the
square
It
was
built
as
family
home
for
the
Montejo
dynasty
and
was
completed
in
1549
The
faÃ§adeÂ âÂ now
the
only
original
element
of
the
houseÂ âÂ is
decorated
with
number
of
ornate
carvings
including
two
large
conquistadors
seen
treading
on
the
heads
of
Mayan
Indians
Perhaps
this
decoration
was
added
to
reaffirm
Montejo
power
in
the
region
Major
renovations
to
the
faÃ§ade
were
completed
in
late
1999
The
style
of
the
house
is
pure
Spanish-colonial
with
an
inner
courtyard
garden
lined
by
rooms
with
high
ceilings
and
huge
wooden
doors
The
house
was
in
the
Montejo
family
until
the
1970s
but
then
passed
into
the
hands
of
bank
which
now
operates
regional
office
ATM
and
currency
exchange
in
the
interior
Visitors
can
wander
into
the
courtyard
but
many
of
the
architectural
treasures
are
off-limits
On
the
west
of
the
square
is
the
Palacio
Municipal
(City
Hall)
painted
pretty
yellow
in
contrast
with
the
trees
in
the
square
Inside
you
can
see
the
wooden-lined
Sala
de
Cabildos
where
the
board
of
the
city
still
holds
its
regular
meetings
The
northern
section
is
taken
up
by
the
Palacio
del
Gobierno
(Governorâs
Palace)
now
merely
an
administrative
building
but
once
the
Governorâs
residence
In
the
inner
courtyard
hang
many
large
canvases
by
artist
Fernando
Castro
Pancheco
illustrating
important
incidents
and
individuals
in
YucatÃ¡nâs
history
On
the
second
floor
the
Salon
de
Historia
long
gallery
room
once
used
for
social
soirÃ©es
has
more
paintings
that
complete
the
collection
The
eastern
side
of
the
square
is
dominated
by
the
Catedral
(1561)
one
of
the
oldest
in
the
Americas
Inside
you
will
find
the
large
crucifix
christened
Cristo
de
las
Ampollas
(Christ
of
the
Blisters)
which
has
been
on
display
here
since
1645
It
was
carved
in
the
1500s
out
of
wood
from
miraculous
tree
so
called
because
it
had
caught
fire
but
did
not
burn
Later
the
finished
crucifix
survived
another
disastrous
fire
though
its
surface
was
blistered
Behind
the
Catedral
on
Calle
61
is
the
Museo
de
la
Ciudad
which
displays
drawings
maps
plans
and
photographs
relating
to
the
planning
and
growth
of
MÃ©rida
Next
to
the
Catedral
on
the
square
is
Museo
de
Arte
ContemporÃ¡neo
Ateneo
de
YucatÃ¡n
(MACAY)
which
occupies
colonial
building
at
the
site
of
the
archbishopâs
palace
now
destroyed
The
gallery
exhibits
the
best
in
modern
art
with
permanent
exhibitions
of
Yucatecan
and
other
Mexican
artists
and
comprehensive
program
of
temporary
exhibitions
Further
works
by
Fernando
Castro
Pancheco
can
be
seen
here
including
some
of
his
early
pieces
The
Plaza
Major
sits
in
square
between
calles
60
and
62
(even
street
numbers
travel
eastâwest)
and
calles
61
and
63
(odd
street
numbers
travel
northâsouth);
the
surrounding
streets
boast
numerous
colonial
gems
that
can
only
be
appreciated
by
strolling
around
the
town
For
those
with
little
time
to
spare
Calle
60
has
the
greatest
concentrated
collection
Walk
north
past
the
Governorâs
Palace
for
three
or
four
blocks
to
take
in
the
wrought-ironâwork
detail
and
the
balconies
and
walls
of
tropical-colored
stucco
that
warms
as
the
afternoon
sun
begins
to
mellow
One
block
north
of
Plaza
Mayor
you
will
find
the
tiny
square
of
Parque
Cepeda
Peraza
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
Iglesia
de
JesÃºs
built
in
the
early
17th
century
by
the
Jesuit
order
Beyond
the
church
is
another
small
square
Parque
Morelos
which
has
sculpture
of
âMother
and
Child,âÂ a
copy
of
the
Renoir
piece
found
in
Paris
The
Teatro
PeÃ³n
Contreras
occupies
the
northern
corner
of
the
square
with
Parisian-style
cafÃ©
and
city
tourist
office
on
its
first
floor
and
regular
schedule
of
performances
The
theatre
is
splendid
example
of
late
19th-
early
20th-century
architecture
with
sweeping
marble
staircase
leading
to
colonnaded
upper
balcony
Across
the
street
is
the
Universidad
de
YucatÃ¡n;
one
block
farther
north
is
Parque
Santa
LucÃ­a
If
you
are
walking
take
right
at
Calle
47
past
Parque
Santa
Anna
then
left
at
the
traffic
signal
This
is
Paseo
Montejo
one
of
the
finest
streets
in
the
city
known
by
citizens
of
MÃ©rida
as
âthe
Champs-ElysÃ¨es
of
YucatÃ¡n.â
This
tree-lined
avenue
was
the
place
to
live
during
the
19th
century
and
all
the
best
families
and
rich
henequen
producers
vied
for
the
best
plots
along
its
length
The
houses
they
built
still
have
an
elegance
and
stature
though
many
were
lost
to
modern
development
replaced
by
hotels
and
bank
buildings
in
the
latter
half
of
the
past
century
The
most
impressive
of
the
remaining
period
buildings
is
Palacio
Canton
which
now
houses
the
Museo
Regional
de
AntropologÃ­a
Historia
(Regional
Anthropological
and
History
Museum)
The
beautiful
plasterwork
detail
and
marble
floors
of
the
palace
are
only
surpassed
by
the
wealth
of
Mayan
artifacts
on
display
The
museum
displays
illustrate
the
most
recent
theories
on
Mayan
societyÂ âÂ so
much
of
which
is
still
conjectureÂ â
Â including
trade
patterns
and
social
customs
On
the
second
floor
of
the
museum
exhibitions
relate
the
methods
used
to
excavate
various
sites
around
YucatÃ¡n
The
museum
is
an
excellent
starting
point
for
your
tour
of
the
Mayan
sites
North
from
the
museum
at
major
intersection
on
the
Paseo
is
the
Monumento
la
Patria
(Monument
to
the
Fatherland
or
National
Monument)
This
huge
limestone
monument
depicting
Mayan
Spanish
and
Mexican
themes
was
begun
in
1944
and
completed
in
1956
MÃ©rida
holds
artistic
and
folkloric
performances
on
every
night
of
the
week
and
an
âall-dayâ
event
in
the
heart
of
the

Although
the
Mayan
city
of
TâHo
has
been
completely
swallowed
by
colonial
MÃ©rida
10-minute
taxi
ride
north
of
the
city
is
DzibilchaltÃºn
city
that
thrived
from
3000
b.c
on
marine
economyÂ âÂ the
coast
being
only
32
km
(20
miles)
away
Archaeologists
believe
that
at
its
peak
in
the
late
Classical
period
(a.d
600â900)
the
population
reached
20,000
and
that
the
function
of
the
city
changed
over
time
from
ceremonial
to
urban
El
Templo
de
las
Siete
MuÃ±ecas
(called
the
Dollâs
House
in
English)
is
the
most
interesting
structure
at
the
site;
it
is
the
only
Mayan
building
with
windows
to
be
found
so
far
though
these
are
not
thought
simply
to
have
provided
light
for
the
room
The
openings
together
with
the
doors
frame
the
five
segments
of
the
sky
marked
by
the
solstices
the
equinoxes
and
the
zenith
When
archaeologists
were
excavating
the
building
they
found
seven
small
clay
dolls
each
with
bodily
deformity
No
one
is
sure
whether
these
were
simply
childâs
toys
or
if
they
had
religious
significance
but
they
gave
the
structure
its
name
The
dolls
are
on
display
at
the
museum
found
just
beyond
the
site
entrance
Uxmal
and
the
Puuc
Route
The
region
to
the
south
of
MÃ©rida
is
known
as
the
Puuc
(pronounced
âpookâ)
It
has
the
highest
ground
in
YucatÃ¡n
the
âSierrita
PuucâÂ âÂ a
ridge
of
limestone
hills
50
(150
ft)
in
height
and
thought
to
be
the
edge
of
giant
crater
formed
when
meteorite
fell
to
earth
millions
of
years
ago
Today
the
land
is
home
to
communities
of
Mayan
farmers
but
the
jungle
has
relinquished
number
of
fine
ancient
sites
to
explore
These
sites
are
called
the
Puuc
and
this
name
has
also
been
taken
to
describe
the
characteristics
of
the
architecture
and
design
of
the
buildings
here
The
Puuc
style
is
characterized
by
latticework
carving
on
the
lower
faÃ§ades
with
masks
and
carvings
on
the
upper
levels
The
Mayan
settlements
of
the
Puuc
region
were
extremely
rich
in
Classical
and
post-Classical
times
because
the
soil
has
always
been
extremely
fertile
It
produced
and
in
fact
still
does
several
crops
each
year
where
farmers
on
the
lowland
(the
rest
of
YucatÃ¡n)
could
only
produce
one
or
maybe
two
The
surpluses
produced
allowed
the
community
to
support
artisans
such
as
stonemasonsÂ âÂ making
the
buildings
here
very
ornateÂ âÂ and
to
trade
with
other
communities
for
goods
and
raw
materials
not
naturally
available
in
the
Puuc
region
The
route
south
from
MÃ©rida
is
the
main
road
to
the
city
of
Campeche
in
the
state
of
same
name
Youâll
travel
through
countryside
once
filled
with
haciendas
(old
colonial
farms
very
much
like
plantations
in
the
Caribbean)
When
the
henequen
boom
was
at
its
height
the
number
of
haciendas
grew
dramatically
but
when
the
system
was
dismantled
in
1937
most
fell
into
decline
The
hacienda
consisted
of
main
house
surrounded
by
its
land
factory
and
village
for
the
hacienda
workers
This
would
include
school
and
company
store
where
workers
were
forced
to
buy
their
supplies
Many
of
the
modern
villages
of
this
region
have
their
roots
in
the
hacienda
system
As
you
pass
through
them
you
may
see
an
old
chimney
breaking
above
the
tree
line
sure
sign
that
the
village
was
once
part
of
hacienda
Turn
off
at
route
261
and
at
km
33
you
will
find
Hacienda
Yaxcopoil
one
of
the
oldest
in
YucatÃ¡n
and
now
museum
dedicated
to
the
old
lifestyle
The
main
house
dates
from
the
17th
century
and
has
been
owned
by
the
present
family
since
1864
The
whole
site
is
faded
and
aging
yet
it
is
still
possible
to
discern
vestiges
of
its
glory
days
It
was
one
of
the
earliest
and
largest
henequen
plants
in
operation
and
the
old
factory
engines
can
still
be
seen
along
with
stock
rooms
and
tool
stores
surrounded
by
present-day
crops
growing
in
the
fields
The
plant
stopped
processing
its
own
crops
in
1984
The
hacienda
school
still
operatesÂ âÂ but
now
as
state
school
The
owner
intends
to
preserve
but
not
renovate
the
buildings
allowing
the
past
to
tell
its
story
Although
many
think
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡
outshines
it
in
size
Uxmal
is
considered
the
jewel
of
Mayan
sites
in
YucatÃ¡n
its
buildings
richly
decorated
with
elaborate
carvings
At
its
peak
between
a.d
600â900
it
is
said
to
have
had
population
of
around
25,000Â âÂ remarkable
when
you
consider
that
it
had
no
water
supply
and
had
to
collect
and
store
its
needs
artificially
One
of
the
highlights
of
the
site
presents
itself
immediately
as
you
enter
The
magnificent
PirÃ¡mide
del
Advino
(Pyramid
of
the
Magician
also
called
the
Pyramid
of
the
Dwarf)
sits
atop
five
older
structures
This
pyramid
is
unique
for
number
of
reasons
It
has
rounded
sides
giving
it
softened
shape
Itâs
steep
(even
more
precipitous
than
the
normal
elevations
in
the
area)
and
the
design
of
the
doorway
at
the
top
which
is
huge
representation
of
Chaac
is
found
at
no
other
site
The
faÃ§ade
of
the
upper
levels
is
extremely
ornate
and
the
main
staircase
has
parallel
row
of
large
Chaac
masks
It
is
closed
to
tourists
at
present
as
work
continues
on
exploring
the
inner
chambers
but
it
is
possible
to
study
the
whole
faÃ§ade
from
the
courtyard
in
front
of
the
pyramid
Next
to
the
pyramid
is
the
CuadrÃ¡ngulo
de
las
Monjas
(Quadrangle
of
the
Nuns)
given
its
name
in
the
16th
century
because
it
resembled
Spanish
monastery
or
nunnery
Its
sizeÂ âÂ over
70
roomsÂ âÂ has
caused
archaeologists
to
postulate
that
it
may
have
been
military
academy
which
expanded
regularly
throughout
its
history
The
western
building
has
the
most
richly
carved
faÃ§ade
There
are
also
numerous
depictions
of
Mayan
homes
or
nah
which
have
changed
little
since
classical
times
and
can
still
be
found
all
across
the
countryside
of
YucatÃ¡n
The
eastern
building
has
statue
of
dwarf
dressed
in
turtle
shell
placed
in
position
normally
associated
with
the
rulers
of
Mayan
cities
serpent
is
entwined
all
along
the
upper
faÃ§ade
around
the
statue
From
its
upper
levels
the
many
buildings
at
the
site
come
clearly
into
view
The
quadrangle
is
the
setting
for
the
Uxmal
Light
and
Sound
Show
which
takes
place
every
evening
South
of
the
quadrangle
beyond
small
ball
court
the
land
rises
to
higher
level
Here
another
group
of
buildings
forms
the
main
center
of
focus
at
the
site
The
Casa
de
las
Tortugas
(Turtle
House)
so
called
because
of
numerous
turtle
motifs
adorning
it
is
found
immediately
on
the
right
Beside
and
totally
dwarfing
it
lies
the
Palacio
del
Gobernador
(Governorâs
Palace)
with
an
imposing
100-m-
(320-ft-)
long
faÃ§ade
The
building
was
erected
in
the
11th
century
for
the
ruler
of
the
city
Halach
Huinic
(the
true
man)
and
consists
of
central
building
flanked
by
two
smaller
wings
The
frieze
of
Chaac
masks
is
one
of
the
most
ornate
and
complex
in
the
known
Mayan
world
Behind
the
palace
is
The
Great
Pyramid;
it
is
less
ornate
than
the
palace
and
only
the
front
faÃ§ade
has
been
excavated
Beyond
this
area
there
are
several
other
groups
of
buildings
many
of
which
have
yet
to
be
excavated
including
the
Dovecote
Group
(which
includes
the
Casa
de
las
Palomas
the
House
of
Doves)
and
the
Grupo
del
Cementario
(Cemetery
Group)
Beyond
these
are
several
even
more
remote
sites
which
can
be
visited
but
you
would
benefit
from
the
services
of
guide
to
find
them
Uxmal
was
very
rich
city
at
the
height
of
its
powers
and
protector
of
many
smaller
settlements
which
paid
tribute
to
it
both
in
food
and
money
string
of
these
sites
now
forms
what
is
called
the
Puuc
Route
and
they
can
all
be
visited
in
one
day
Though
small
each
one
has
something
different
to
reveal
First
in
the
tour
is
Kabah
only
27
km
(17
miles)
south
of
Uxmal
The
major
structure
at
the
site
is
the
Codz-Pop
or
Palace
of
the
Masks
constructed
in
Chenes
styleÂ âÂ characterized
by
masks
covering
the
whole
faÃ§ade
of
the
structure
from
ground
to
roof
There
are
said
to
have
been
over
250
Chaac
representationsÂ âÂ a
most
impressive
sight
unique
in
the
Mayan
world
Codz-Pop
means
ârolled-up
sleeping
mat,â
referring
to
the
curled-up
nose
on
the
masks
Cross
the
main
road
dividing
the
site
to
find
restored
archway
which
once
marked
the
end
of
sacred
sacbÃ©
(Mayan
road)
from
Uxmal
Eight
kilometers
(5
miles)
south
of
Kabah
is
Sayil
famed
for
its
major
building
called
El
Palacio
(the
Palace)
by
the
Spanish
With
over
100
rooms
it
would
be
important
for
its
size
alone
but
the
ornate
decoration
makes
it
even
more
impressive
with
representations
of
the
Descending
God
found
so
prominently
at
Tulum
Nearby
Xlapak
has
only
one
major
structure
palace
but
LabnÃ¡
the
final
Puuc
site
on
the
tour
has
number
of
structures
to
explore
El
Palacio
here
is
decorated
with
alligators
whose
open
jaws
each
have
human
head
emerging
from
them
This
symbol
called
Pop
is
thought
to
be
indicative
of
power
and
is
only
found
at
this
site
sacbÃ©
links
the
palace
to
other
parts
of
the
site
The
largest
structure
is
the
Mirador
pyramid
temple
over
20
(65
ft)
high
Visitors
in
the
1900s
found
decoration
on
the
building
which
has
since
been
worn
away
or
lost
Next
to
the
Mirador
is
the
most
famous
sight
in
LabnÃ¡
also
much
changed
since
its
discovery
El
Arco
(the
Arch)
is
late
Puuc
style
and
was
thought
to
have
been
the
entrance
to
the
courtyard
of
family
residence
Though
the
arch
remains
two
ornate
walls
at
either
side
of
it
have
collapsed
during
the
20th
century
Before
leaving
the
Puuc
area
visit
the
LoltÃºn
Caves
The
guided
tour
through
these
impressive
caverns
takes
90
minutes;
you
can
see
evidence
of
where
the
Mayan
rebels
fortified
the
entrances
during
the
War
of
the
Castes
in
the
1840s
What
to
Do
Sports
Most
visitors
to
the
Costa
del
Sol
do
not
plan
daytime
activities
more
energetic
than
lazing
on
the
beach
and
save
their
energy
for
nightlife
However
sports
facilities
are
in
abundance
for
those
who
want
to
work
off
the
effects
of
too
much
paella
during
the
daylight
hours

but

What
to
Buy
Traditional
Spanish
handicrafts
are
high
on
any
souvenir-hunterâs
shopping
list
Ceramics:
Everyday
glazed
terracotta
pottery
can
be
bought
all
along
the
coast
Thereâs
also
wide
selection
of
tiles
(azulejos)
vases
bowls
and
jugs
with
floral
or
geometric
decorations
in
bright
colors
Foodstuffs:
Take
home
taste
of
Spain
with
some
olives
olive
oil
almonds
cheese
or
mouthwatering
candies
and
cookies
Jewelry:
Silver
rings
bracelets
and
necklaces
in
modern
designs
make
good
buys
as
do
the
artificial
Majorica
pearls
of
Spain
Look
too
for
fine
filigree
jewelry
from
CÃ³rdoba
and
smooth
polished
olive
wood
beads
Leather
and
Suede:
Choose
from
wide
selection
of
handbags
belts
wallets
trousers
skirts
and
coats
Leather
goods
while
no
longer
the
bargain
they
once
were
compare
favorably
in
price
with
Italian
and
French
made
articles
and
the
local
factories
do
turn
out
stylish
high-quality
leather
clothing
CÃ³rdoba
which
has
been
producing
leather
goods
since
Roman
times
is
famous
for
its
embossed
leather
Beware
though
many
of
the
leather
goods
you
will
see
have
been
imported
from
Morocco
and
are
sold
at
vastly
inflated
prices
Itâs
actually
cheaper
and
much
more
interesting
to
take
day
trip
to
Tangier
and
buy
such
goods
there
Souvenirs:
Often
delightfully
tacky
from
plastic
castanets
and
flamenco
dolls
to
imitation
wineskins
and
even
bullfight
posters
printed
with
your
own
name
Wine
and
Spirits:
Sweet
MÃ¡laga
wine
sherry
brandy
and
Spanish
wines
provide
some
of
the
best
bargains
in
Spain
and
are
generally
cheaper
when
bought
in
supermarket
than
at
the
last
minute
at
the
duty-free
shop
in
the
airport
Entertainment
Tour
operators
offer
any
number
of
excursions
some
more
esoteric
than
others
with
brochures
and
booking
facilities
available
through
your
hotel
or
local
travel
agent
Another
form
of
organized

Bullfights:
AndalucÃ­a
is
famed
for
its
bullfighting
traditions
and
has
two
Sevilla
and
CÃ³rdoba
of
the
seven
first-class
Plaza
de
Toros
(bullrings)
in
Spain
The
provincial
capitals
of
AlmerÃ­a
Granada
Huelva
JaÃ©n
and
MÃ¡laga
as
well
as
Algeciras
and
El
Puerto
de
Santa
MarÃ­a
are
second-class
rings
All
others
including
those
of
the
resort
towns
along
the
Costa
del
Sol
come
into
the
third
class
category
The
two
main
events
are
Corrida
de
Toros
where
fully
qualified
matadors
fight
fully-grownÂ âÂ at
least
year
oldÂ âÂ toros
(bulls)
and
Novilladas
where
novilleros
(novice
matadors)
fight
novillos
(immature
bulls)
As
rule
of
thumb
the
better
events
are
held
in
the
better
plazas
particularly
during
the
ferÃ­as
(holiday
fairs)
held
in
the
major
cities
Equally
true
is
the
fact
that
most
of
the
events
held
in
the
resort
towns
are
mainly
for
the
benefit
of
tourists
and
are
of
lesser
quality
They
are
not
generally
less
expensive
though;
small
rings
mean
fewer
seats
which
often
equates
to
higher
prices
Contrary
to
popular
opinion
bullfights
are
not
held
every
Sunday
in
each
city
In
fact
outside
of
the
ferÃ­asÂ âÂ when
they
are
held
dailyÂ âÂ only
Sevilla
has
them
on
regular
basis
throughout
the
season
In
other
places
with
the
exception
of
Easter
Sunday
and
August
15Â âÂ important
national
holidaysÂ âÂ they
are
held
sporadically
and
advertised
by
way
of
the
ubiquitous
carteles
(posters)
stuck
on
every
wall
Be
warned
though
these
events
are
never
less
than
bloodyÂ âÂ and
can
be
much
worse
They
are
however
enthralling
spectacles
and
whatever
your
reaction
youâll
gain
valuable
insight
into
the
country
and
the
people
Flamenco:
All
the
coastal
resorts
offer
flamenco
shows
for
tourists
These
shows
can
be
entertaining
but
the
performances
are
more
show
business
than
the
true
spirit
of
flamenco
To
experience
flamenco
at
its
most
authentic
you
will
have
to
search
out
bars
and
small
clubs
in
MÃ¡laga
or
Sevilla
Ask
the
local
tourist
office
for
advice
on
where
to
go
Flamenco
is
an
ancient
art
form
combining
elements
of
Visigothic
Moorish
and
gypsy
music
There
are
two
distinct
types;
the
cante
jondo
(deep
song)
an
intense
outpouring
of
emotion
and
the
animated
cante
chico
(light
song)
There
are
also
different
varieties
of
flamenco
dance
(the
tango
fandango
farruca
and
zambra)
performed
to
the
staccato
rhythms
and
counter-rhythms
of
the
castanets
hand
clapping
(palmadas)
and
finger
snapping
(pitos)
as
well
as
furious
heel-drumming
(zapateado)
There
is
no
need
to
speak
Spanish
to
enjoy
the
spectacleÂ âÂ you
simply
have
to
feel
the
music
Discotheques
and
Nightclubs:
Some
discos
open
as
early
as
9pm
but
most
donât
gear
up
for
business
until
11pm
or
midnight
They
close
late
too
around
4am
or
even
later
Nightclubs
(salas
de
fiesta)
usually
stage
two
shows
an
evening
one
at
about
midnight
or
1am
and
the
other
around
3am
Depending
on
the
club
the
show
may
feature
flamenco
performances
drag
acts
or
shows
with
semi-nude
women
Bars
pubs
and
clubs
often
provide
musical
entertainment
Casinos:
Two
gambling
establishments
operate
from
8pm
to
the
early
hours;
the
Casino
Torrequebrada
in
BenalmÃ¡dena-Costa
and
the
Casino
Marbella
under
the
Hotel
AndalucÃ­a
Plaza
in
Puerto
BanÃºs
In
addition
to
the
usual
games
the
casinos
have
bar
restaurant
and
nightclub
on
the
premises
Formal
dress
(jacket
and
tie
for
gentlemen)
is
required
Donât
forget
to
bring
your
passport
along
for
identification
Concerts:
From
May
to
October
TÃ­voli
World
brings
the
stars
of
rock
and
pop
to
Torremolinos
for
concerts
in
the
open

The
seasonâs
program
may
include
performances
of
flamenco
and
zarzuela
(Spanish
light
opera)
In
winter
MÃ¡lagaâs
symphony

performs
in
the
Teatro

and
guest

Children
on
the
Costa
del
Sol
The
Costa
del
Sol
is
an
ideal
place
for
vacationing
families
with
kidsÂ âÂ it
is
after
all
one
long
beach
Apart
from
paddling
and
sandcastles
older
children
can
learn
how
to
sail
waterski
or
windsurf
If
you
donât
feel
happy
about
letting
your
children
play
in
the
sea
especially
the
younger
ones
the
water
parks
at
Mijas
Torremolinos
and
Estepona
offer
safer
and
more
controlled
environment
where
itâs
easier
to
keep
close
eye
on
them
Alternative
diversions
for
children
include
the
aquariums
in
BenalmÃ¡dena
and
Puerto
BanÃºs
the
Eagle
Park
in
BenalmÃ¡dena
the
Cueva
(cave)
De
Nerja
and
Mini-
Hollywood
near
AlmerÃ­a
In
the
evenings
TÃ­voli
World
near
BenalmÃ¡dena
provides
all
the
fun
of
the
fair
with
carnival
rides
and
roller
coaster
and
thereâs
also
bar
and
flamenco
show
for
the
grown-ups
The
Crocodile
Park
just
north
of
MÃ¡laga
will
intrigue
most
children
as
will
the
horse
shows
of
El
Ranchito
in
BenalmÃ¡dena
and
Aires
del
Sur
in
Estepona
When
youâre
on
the
beach
donât
forget
that
kids
are
especially
vulnerable
to
the
effects
of
too
much
sun
Take
along
plenty
of
high-factor
sunscreen
and
sun
hats
and
make
sure
theyâre
covered
up
during
the
middle
of
the
day
(a
siesta
during
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
may
be
good
idea
to
avoid
sunburn)

Pidgin
Saying
[Literally
In
dire
straits
monkey
will
even
eat
chillies
or
Anything
will
do
in
an
emergency.]
Pidgin
English
is
spoken
by
millions
of
people
all
over
the
Third
World
There
are
many
varieties
but
they
are
all
most
expressive
and
entertaining
The
most
publicized
is
probably
Tok
Pisin
the
pidgin
of
Papua
New
Guinea
This
has
developed
into
language
in
its
own
right
One
of
the
country's
weekly
newspapers
Wantok
is
published
entirely
in
Tok
Pisin
and
there
are
daily
radio
programs
in
it,
Attempts
have
even
been
made
to
introduce
the
works
of
Shakespeare
to
the
masses
by
translating
them
into
Tok
Pisin
No
one
who
has
ever
seen
the
Bard's
immortal
words

Caesar...
reduced
to
Mi
kam

Kaesar
..
can
be
expected
to
take
Shakespeare
too
seriously
again
And
Tok
Pisin
version
of
Little
Red
Riding
Hood
told
me
some
years
ago
by
an
old
China
Sea
sailor
remains
to
this
day
one
of
the
most
hilarious
monologues
have
ever
heard
Tok
Pisin
does
not
stand
on
ceremony
either
Even
the
formidable
Duke
of
Edinburgh
was
heard
to
remark
ruefully
on
an
official
visit
to
Papua
New
Guinea
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
maintain
stiff
upper
lip
when
one
was
constantly
being
introduced
as
Whitefella
Blongum
Kween
But
it
is
Coast
Pidgin
with
which
am
most
familiar
This
is
the
lingua
franca
of
West
Africa
worked
as
forester
on
The
Coast
for
thirty
years
so
suppose
had
more
time
than
most
to
become
fluent
in
the
language
Here
too
there
are
subtle
differences
from
one
country
to
another
both
in
the
spoken
word
and
in
the
written
word
from
the
phonetic
Krio
of
Sierra
Leone
and
Liberia
to
the
more
straightforward
pidgins
of
Nigeria
and
Cameroon
But
whatever
its
background
pidgin
remains
colorful
and
often
onomatopoetic
In
Coast
Pidgin
mud
becomes
putta-putta
and
noise
becomes
wahallah
phrase
like
have
been
involved
in
an
accident
becomes
graphically
dun

One's
outrage
over
some
disastrous
contretemps
is
alleviated
somewhat
by
the
culprit's
risible
attempts
to
explain
away
the
circumstances
of
his
crime
in
pidgin
had
in
my
employ
for
mercifully
brief
period
an
ancient
caretaker
called
Sixpence
Sixpence's
main
claim
to
fame
was
that
as
very
young
lad
living
in
Cameroon
he
had
been
employed
by
the
celebrated
Mary
Kingsley
as
houseboy
His
relationship
with
the
renowned
traveler
had
ended
in
some
acrimony
after
just
eight
hours
during
which
time
Sixpence
had
managed
to
consign
the
whole
of
her
insect
collection
(painstakingly
accumulated
for
the
British
Museum)
to
the
bonfire
which
he
had
lit
in
the
compound
outside
her
chalet
for
the
express
purpose
of
burning
the
rubbish
from
within
it
This
was
the
day
on
which
Sixpence's
innocence
had
come
to
an
end
and
Miss
Kingsley's
sulfurous
expertise
with
the
English
language
had
remained
indelibly
etched
in
his
memory
all
his
life
Sixpence's
eyesight
was
failing
badly
when
we
first
met
and
he
was
disaster-prone
Gas
cooking
had
just
been
introduced
to
the
European
houses
in
the
area
at
the
time
hired
him
and
Sixpence
was
soon
to
find
out
had
much
to
learn
about
the
dangers
of
gas
cylinders
was
walking
up
the
path
one
day
when
colossal
explosion
rent
Africa
asunder
and
large
part
of
my
house
fell
down
before
my
eyes
stumbled
through
the
dust
and
the
ruins
to
find
Sixpence
dazed
but
miraculously
unscathed
sitting
amidst
the
debris

slightly
bowdlerized
translation
might
read:

Then

Pidgin
loses
much
of
its
character
when
written
and
it
is
sad
fact
that
both
the
writing
and
the
speaking
of
it
is
discouraged
today
in
many
of
West
Africa's
more
modern
schools
for
much
the
same
reason
suppose
that
remember
many
years
ago
being
made
to
feel
an
outcast
for
having
Gaelic
as
my
mother
tongue
in
an
English-speaking
school
in
my
native
Scotland
One
would
hope
that
the
evocative
pidgin
will
be
kept
alive
If
it
is
it
will
be
due
in
no
small
part
to
the
efforts
of
few
of
the
older
missionaries
in
the
hinterland
am
not
alas
of
their
faith
but
had
to
admire
the
command
these
old-timers
had
of
tribal
languages
in
general
and
of
pidgin
in
particular
It
was
from
one
of
those
missionaries
that
obtained
copy
of
Genesis
in
pidgin
English
It
was
version
still
being
used
in
churches
in
parts
of
Nigeria
and
Cameroon
when
was
there:

no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
without
pidgin
West
Africa
would
be
the
poorer
It
is
language
of
humor
and
it
can
lighten
the
darkest
of
moments
have
rarely
known
situation
so
bad
that
few
words
of
pidgin
could
not
make
it
seem
little
brighter
It
was
the
height
of
the
African
rainy
season
and
had
hitched
ride
with
an
old
Dutch
missionary
to
ceremony
several
hundred
miles
away
to
which
we
had
both
been
invited
The
roads
were
sea
of
mud
and
now
with
night
approaching
we
were
stuck
finally
and
irrevocably
in
the
middle
of
the
rainforest
The
river
in
front
of
us
thundered
over
the
road
where
just
the
day
before
wooden
bridge
had
spanned
it
Behind
us
colossal
tree
had
fallen
across
the
road
effectively
blocking
our
retreat
We
had
not
eaten
since
morning
and
the
chances
of
our
doing
so
in
the
next
twelve
hours
looked
slim
indeed
troupe
of
chimpanzees
emerged
from
the
forest
beyond
the
river
They
were
the
wettest
looking
monkeys
had
ever
seen
They
stopped
and
stared
at
us
then
began
chorus
of
hooting
noises
that
echoed
out
through
the
treetops
swear
that
they
were
laughing
at
us
No
food
for
us
this
night
Father
said
sorrowfully
In
fact
at
this
rate
we'll
be
lucky
to
eat
before
Christmas!
He
did
not
reply
immediately
He
was
ferreting
around
behind
the
car
seat
He
hauled
out
disreputable-looking
traveling
bag
and
rummaged
inside
caught
glimpses
of
white
soutane
some
underpants
string
of
rosary
beads
big
black
Bible
Finally
he
unearthed
what
he
was
looking
for
He
removed
the
cork
and
handed
the
bottle
to
me
The
twinkle
was
back
in
his
wise
old
eyes
Jam
pass
die
he
said
Monkey
chop
peppeh
took
long
long
pull
at
Scotland's
finest
felt
it
kindle
heavenly
fires
within
me
right
down
to
the
soles
of
my
boots
Suddenly
Africa
did
not
seem
so
wet
and
muddy
and
dreary
after
all
handed
the
amber
nectar
back
to
the
Reverend
Father
The
old
man
raised
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
we
watched
as
the
chimps
scurried
silently
one
behind
the
other
back
into
the
sodden
forest
Yes
Father
replied
with
quiet
satisfaction
Monkey
chop
peppeh
indeed!
The
Day
They
Took
the
Peck
out
of
Pecksniffian
Erskine
Caldwell
must
have
felt
that
one
lexical
epoch
was
enough
for
him
He
stayed
with
the
same
old
Webster's
New
Collegiate
Dictionary
he
began
with;
when
it
threatened
to
come
apart
he
would
have
it
rebound
As
contributor
to
the
language
and
one
whose
writings
were
confined
to
snapshot
of
time
and
people
Caldwell
could
well
afford
to
stand
pat
As
mere
word
user
must
keep
up
with
the
times
Every
twenty
years
or
so
upgrade
my
dictionary
It
was
in
that
spirit
of
personal
progress
that
replaced
my
Webster's
Seventh
New
Collegiate
Dictionary
with
the
Ninth
Upgrading
is
pain;
decades
of
accumulated
notes
highlights
and
cross-reference
jottings
must
be
transferred
to
the
sterile
new
edition
Things
were
going
fine
until
got
to
the
word
Pecksniffian
It
was
still
there
but
the
definition
had
been
cleansed
of
its
contemptible
meaning
and
made
tolerably
benign
After
entering
the
proper
definition
in
the
margin
Selfish
and
corrupt
behind
display
of
seeming
benevolence
sat
down
to
decipher
the
new
version:
unctuously
hypocritical
That
is
about
as
easy
to
embrace
as
wet
eel
about
as
useful
as
punctured
balloon
Describing
Pecksniffian
scoundrel
as
merely
hypocritically
hypocritical
implies
that
something
can
indeed
be
less
than
nothing
as
that
theory
was
catechized
by
Wilbur
the
pig
in
Charlotte's
Web
Charles
Dickens'
character
Seth
Pecksniff
made
his
debut
about
the
time
the
YMCA
was
founded
only
few
years
before
P.T
Barnum
introduced
us
to
the
Swedish
Nightingale
Jenny
Lind
As
words
go
Pecksniffian
is
youngster
The
word
Calvinism
was
coined
in
Vasco
da
Gama's
day
and
during
the
four
centuries
since
has
been
left
pretty
much
alone
Seth
Pecksniff
could
no
more
undergo
post-mortem
metamorphosis
than
John
Calvin
Dickens
certainly
was
not
wishy-washy
when
it
came
to
developing
characters
and
Seth
Pecksniff
was
definitely
not
just
quick
study
among
the
cast
in
Martin
Chuzzlewit
Something
sinister
is
up
thought
I
Why
would
lexicographer
snatch
up
unique
Dickensian
creation
gag
him
and
bind
his
real
persona
hand
and
foot
then
slyly
stand
an
impersonator
in
his
place?
This
is
clearly
sign
of
unctuous
hypocrites
at
work
Did
the
decriminalization
of
Pecksniff
have
more
expansive
implications?
Persons
in
high
places
would
any
day
rather
be
called
hypocritical
than
corrupt
With
queasy
frantic
haste
as
one
might
inventory
his
burgled
residence
looked
up
corrupt
Whew!
Still
intact:
morally
degenerate
and
perverted
had
been
prepared
for
anything:
hypocritical
demonstrating
poor
judgment,..
For
years
and
years
Merriam-Webster
has
held
out
an
explicit
definition
of
Pecksniffian
one
precisely
consistent
with
the
Pecksniff
we
know
and
usage
has
squared
with
that
definition
It
was
special
word
unambiguously
descriptive
of
character's
character
Users
have
been
respectfully
fussy
about
employing
that
distinctive
word;
it
has
not
been
slung
around
indiscriminately
as
quintessential
is
today
literal
translation
of
unctuously
hypocritical--the
phrase
does
demand
some
translation--
would
describe
ordinary
slick
operators
mainly
putting
on
airs
Hypocrites
even
hypocritical
hypocrites
are
dime
dozen
One
can
see
parade
of
the
species
on
TV
any
Sunday
Sometimes
they
even
pop
up
in
our
bathroom
mirrors
But
Pecksniffians
are
different
breed
They
are
not
simply
characters
who
display
contrived
earnestness
and
advertise
virtues
they
don't
have
like
the
big
smile
and
self-bestowed
nickname
Honest
John
your
friendly
usedcar
dealer
The
Pecksnifflan
is
not
so
benign
Fortunately
for
society
Pecksniffians
are
spread
pretty
thin
among
the
general
population
It
would
scarcely
concern
Pecksniff
that
we
suspected
that
he
is
not
what
we
had
first
thought--
or
hoped
for
What
he
desperately
hopes
to
conceal
is
what
he
truly
is:
corrupt!
Yes
realize
the
living
nature
of
language
expect
gradual
evolutionary
changes
in
word
usage
But
the
sanitizing
of
Pecksniffian
was
no
more
evolutionary
than
the
stallion's
transmutation
to
gelding
The
old
and
new
definitions
are
so
opposed
as
to
be
in
mortal
combat
One
might
want
to
keep
one's
guard
up
when
dealing
with
an
unctuously
hypocritical
old
boy
but
that
comes
somewhat
naturally
because
unctuosity
in
people
is
pretty
easy
to
spot
But
unctuous
hypocrites
are
not
the
sort
who
would
make
$500
billion
raid
on
the
US
Treasury
in
broad
daylight
That
kind
of
job
demands
the
talents
of
genuine
Pecksniffian
politicians
and
their
Pecksniffian
pals
Was
Charles
Keating
as
he
passed
out
worthless
bonds
in
exchange
for
thousands
of
citizens'
retirement
nest
eggs
merely
unctuously
hypocritical
or
was
he
corrupt
behind
display
of
seeming
benevolence?

against
particularly
talented
Reverend
Pecksniff
actually
averted
the
destruction
of
his
empire
with
tele-tearful
explanation
that
his
debauchery
was
sacrificial
and
in
the
line
of
duty:
It
was
on-the-job
training
for
hand-to-hand
combat
with
the
devil!

There
is

to

the
meanings
of
words

unmistakable
terms

it
in
the
early
1980s

with
the
apex
of
the

when
Merriam-Webster
discovered
the
tolerable
side
of
Seth
Pecksniff
Then
after
that
the
Texas
Penal
Code
redefined
car
theft
to

use
of

and
decreased
the

for

that

the

substances
Dope

in
that
nature
of

to
come

were

Now

simply
excising

All
these
italicized
words
belong
to
sizable
group
of
verbs
based
on
names--
names
of
people
brands
places
time
periods
and
so
on
But
although
we
can
talk
about
proper
nouns
and
proper
adjectives
we
do
not
have
proper
term
to
classify
such
verbs
Surely
they
deserve
to
be
classified
but
as
what?
The
answer
is
not
an
easy
one
so
before
trying
to
put
forward
some
ideas
let
us
start
by
looking
at
how
similar
nouns
and
adjectives
are
classed
The
words
Jane
Italy
and
February
are
three
examples
of
what
we
usually
refer
to
as
proper
nouns--those
individual
nouns
that
refer
primarily
to
people
places
and
time
periods
and
that
are
generally
written
with
an
initial
capital
letter
Such
words
can
also
be
termed
proper
names
or
proper
nouns
though
these
more
general
terms
may
also
include
titles
The
Times
Gone
With
The
Wind
)
nationalities
the
Japanese
Russians
)
ethnic
or
religious
groups
Arabs
Jews
)
languages
English
Swahili
)
buildings
the
Central
Station
Durham
Cathedral
)
and
organizations
OPEC
the
United
Nations
)
Some
grammar
books
go
step
further
pointing
out
that
along
with
proper
nouns
there
is
also
category
of
proper
adjectives
Proper
adjectives
we
are
told
generally
derive
from
proper
names
and
are
also
usually
written
with
an
initial
capital
letter
In
the
main
they
refer
to
nationalities
Swiss
British
Egyptian
)
places
Venetian
Himalayan
Balkan
)
ethnic
linguistic
or
religious
groups
Sanskrit
Gaelic
Muslim
)
and
people
Napoleonic
Smithsonian
Dantesque
)
Sometimes
proper
noun
is
used
attributively
as
an
adjective
London
buy
)
Some
proper
nouns
and
proper
adjectives
that
have
given
rise
to
widely
used
expressions
are
normally
written
with
lower-case
letter;
examples
include
cardigan
boycott
sandwich
platonic
love
quixotic
Many
experts
however
prefer
to
categorize
these
as
common
nouns
or
adjectives
labelling
them
eponyms
--words
derived
from
names
In
fact
the
name
that
originally
inspired
the
word
is
now
often
merely
incidental
to
the
meaning
and
presumably
in
consequence
the
capital
letter
is
omitted
These
factors
appear
to
strip
such
words
of
proper
status
The
OED
states
quite
dogmatically
that
proper
noun
is
written
with
an
initial
capital
letter
Other
sources
are
not
quite
so
outspoken;
Merriam-Webster
dictionaries
maintain
that
proper
nouns
are
usually
capitalized
in
English
Definitions
tend
to
be
gerrymandered
to
comply
with
editorial
policies
small
number
of
problems
of
capitalization--and
therefore
of
categorization--arise
as
for
instance
with
words
and
expressions
like
F/french
fries
Hoover
B/bohemian
C/casanova
S/scotch
whisky
C/casarean
In
such
cases
there
seem
to
be
few
hard
and
fast
rules:
some
dictionaries
indicate
capital
letter
others
small
letter
still
others
give
both
forms
Here
the
dividing
lines
between
proper
nouns
and
adjectives
and
eponymous
common
nouns
and
adjectives
become
even
hazier
But
rather
than
pursue
that
obscure
tack
any
further
(place
names
such
as
Washington
are
surely
both
proper
nouns
and
eponyms)
let
us
see
if
the
proper
categories
of
words
really
end
there
as
grammar
books
tend
to
suggest
If
we
have
proper
nouns
and
proper
adjectives
can
we
not
have
proper
verbs
too?
What
about
verbs
such
as
boycott
hoover
gerrymander
pasteurize
(all
based
on
personal
names
though
all
usually
written
with
small
letter)
Can
they
not
be
termed
proper
verbs?
Once
again
as
far
as
these
verbs
are
concerned
the
answer
would
seem
to
lie
in
the
lack
of
an
initial
capital
letter
and
the
fact
that
they
refer
to
something
very
much
removed
from
the
naine
itself
For
these
reasons
most
grammarians
would
simply
classify
these
verbs
as
eponyms
If
however
we
look
at
few
more
verbs
based
on
names
the
situation
is
perhaps
not
quite
so
clear
cut
Brand
names
for
example
are
also
regularly
seen
in
verbal
form;
some
typical
examples
are
shown
in
the
following
sentences
(All
name-based
verbs
given
as
examples
in
this
article
are
included
in
the
OED2

Quite
deliberately
some
of
these
have
been
written
with
capital
letters
and
some
with
lower-case
letters
To
coca-colonize
cellophane
and
xerox
appear
to
work
quite
well
with
small
letters
but
capital
letters
are
surely
preferable
for
many
of
the
others
It
probably
depends
on
how
widely
used
each
individual
verb
is
Whether
or
not
capital
letter
is
used
may
often
be
question
of
personal
choice
and
dictionaries
frequently
give
both
forms
Place
names
can
also
crop
up
in
verbal
form
C/charleston
being
classic
example
Countries
areas
and
cities
used
as
verbs
can
often
indicate
visit:
you
might
hear:
They
Cyprused

spring
or
We
Florida'd
last
fall
in
the
course
of
normal
conversation
But
other
more
specific
meanings
can
become
attached
to
places:
to
Benidorm
means
to
develop
(a
seaside
resort
without
much
respect
to
the
natural
landscape
or
the
urban
environment);
to
Rubicon
implies
going
beyond
point
of
no
return
Hardly
anyone
is
aware
that
the
verb
to
meander
comes
from
the
name
of
the
winding
Menderes
river
in
Turkey
Place
names
and
the
like
often
become
verbs
when
used
with
an-
ize
or
an
ify
suffix:
The
story
was
Hollywoodized;
The
area
risks
being
balkanized;
The
region
was
Vaticanized;
The
decor
was
Frenchified;
The
country
is
becoming
Swissified;
The
immigrant
quickly
became
Americanized;
Standard
British
English
is
being
Cockneyfied
Capital
letters
are
generally
used
here
except
for
verbs
which
have
become
fairly
common
Capital
letters
usually
seem
compulsory
for
names
of
time
periods
used
as
verbs

New

She

are
essential
in

where
we
find
the

all
being
used
as

Personal
names
probably
constitute
the
largest
category
of
name-based
verbs
Frequently
used

found
in
dictionaries
are
usually
written
with
lower-case
letters

to
morse
But
more
original
significant
use
of
personal
name
in
verbal
form
is
more
likely
to
be
written
with
capital
letter
Advertising
copy
topical
conversation
and
song
lyrics
seem
to
be
three
very
fertile
sources
of
this
latter
use
For
example
in
the
song
Rainbow
High
from
Evita
by
Andrew
Lloyd
Webber
and
Tim
Rice
we
find
So
Christian
Dior
me
So
Machiavell-me
So
Lauren
Bacall
me
There
are
numerous
expressions
based
on
famous
names
that
celebrate
the
well-known
traits
of
the
people
in
question;
here
is
fairly
short
list:
She

The

Stop

Charming

They
unsuccessfully
tried
to

He

Tom

so!
The
examples
Ponting
and
Prince
Charming
from
the
above
list
are
generally
found
as
verbs
only
in
their
ing
form
as
that
is
their
original
form
But
few
other
name-based
verbs
seem
to
have
such
constraints
probably
because
English
is
such
relatively
uninflected
language
whereas
many
other
languages
have
dozens
or
even
hundreds
of
verb
forms
The
flexible
nature
of
English
means
that
verbs
can
easily
be
based
on
names
whereas
in
Latinate
languages
with
their
many
inflections
such
process
is
clearly
hampered
Perhaps
it
is
precisely
because
our
approach
to
the
grammar
of
English
is
still
in
many
ways
based
on
Latin
grammar
that
we
do
not
have
specific
grammatical
term
for
name-based
verbs
and
it
is
time
to
give
proper
recognition
to
this
feature
The
dividing
line
between
proper
nouns
(and
proper
names)
and
common
nouns-cum-eponyms
is
difficult
to
define
Nevertheless
two
key
factors
for
classification
seem
to
be
whether
the
name
behind
the
verb
is
still
relevant
to
the
meaning
and
whether
capital
letter
is
used
Such
considerations
are
also
pertinent
to
name-based
adjectives
There
would
appear
to
be
no
reason
why
the
first
of
these
defining
factors
cannot
be
applied
equally
well
to
verbs
boycott
and
to
boycott
could
be
labelled
hand-in-hand
as
eponymous
noun
and
verb
(poor
Capt
Boycott
having
been
forgotten
by
everyone
except
the
etymologists
and
encyclopedists)
In
the
majority
of
cases
however
the
name
is
not
irrelevant
and
the
capital
is
usually
kept
Clearly
we
need
second
category
for
those
verbs
that
still
allude
directly
to
the
name
and
that
are
consequently
often
written
with
capital
letter
The
only
proper
term
for
such
category
must
be
proper
verb

Elementary
My
Dear
Mendeleev
The
categorization
of
all
the
known
elements
of
the
day
by
the
Russian
scientist
Dmitri
Ivanovich
Mendeleev
(1834-1907)
represents
an
instance
of
genius
in
nomenclature
and
classification
Not
only
did
Mendeleev
notice
that
the
elements
could
be
grouped
together
in
chart
that
related
their
atomic
numbers
(the
number
of
neutrons
in
the
nucleus
of
their
base
isotope)
but
he
also
saw
that
this
relationship
grouped
together
elements
with
similar
chemical
characteristics
For
instance
all
the
noble
gases
(neon
argon
krypton
xenon
and
radon)
are
arranged
in
vertical
row
at
the
right-hand
edge
of
the
table
However
just
because
elements
in
the
same
area
of
the
Table
are
related
atomically
and
chemically
this
neatness
is
not
necessarily
reflected
in
the
names
let
alone
the
two-character
symbols
we
have
given
to
elements
which
reflect
all
the
chaos
variety
whims
and
even
vanity
of
history
and
human
nature
Let
us
start
with
some
of
the
more
common
elements
however
as
their
etymology
best
illustrates
the
complete
arbitrariness
in
naming
elements
Hydrogen
with
atomic
number
1
is
actually
rather
straightforward:
its
name
comes
from
easily
recognized
Latin
roots
for
water
and
create
It
is
the
most
common
element
in
the
universe
and
it
is
the
most
common
element
in
ordinary
everyday
water
In
German
it
is
called
very
prosaically
Wasserstoffe
water
stuff
in
recognition
of
its
role
as
the
basic
building
block
of
water
German
has
number
of
other
element
names
which
end
in
-stoffe:
Kohlstoffe
Sauerstoffe
and
Stickstoffe
being
the
best
known
Kohlstoffe
is
of
course
the
stuff
of
coal
or
charcoal
Both
coal
and
c(h)ar
come
from
IE
ker
meaning
charcoal
Sauerstoffe
is
not
reference
to
SÃ¤uerkraut
but
in
way
that
is
not
as
crazy
as
it
sounds:
SÃ¤ure
is
the
German
word
for
acid
and
oxygen
is
likewise
the
stuff
that
makes
acids
Oxy
comes
from
Greek
oxus
sharp
IE
ak
sharp
and
sour
both
being
descriptive
of
acid
Nitrogen
is
little
more
complicated
The
word
comes
from
Greek
natron
ash
or
soda
What
might
have
been
referred
to
was
nitrogen's
key
role
in
creating
nitrates
and
other
alkaline
(soda-like)
compounds
Alongside
these
four
most
common
elements--probably
99
per
cent
of
all
atoms
in
organic
molecules
are
either
carbon
oxygen
hydrogen
or
nitrogen--we
should
consider
some
of
the
elements
without
which
our
standard
of
living
would
be
impossible:
the
base
and
precious
metals
group
of
five
metallic
elements
which
were
well
known
to
the
ancients
and
which
also
have
in
common
symbols
that
do
not
resemble
the
English
words
for
them
are
lead
(Pb)
copper
(Cu)
mercury
(Hg)
silver
(Ag)
and
gold
(Au)
The
reason
the
symbols
vary
so
much
from
their
names
is
that
they
are
abbreviations
of
names
given
them
in
ancient
times
Mercury
also
called
quicksilver
is
liquid
at
room
temperature
and
thus
brought
to
mind
the
fleet-footed
Roman
messenger
god
However
the
Greeks
also
called
the
metal
quicksilver;
in
Greek
liquid
silver
is
hydrÃ¡rgyros
from
which
the
symbol
Hg
derived
Copper
is
from
ME
coper
OE
coper/copor
Proto-Germanic
kupar
and
is
called
cuprum
in
Late
Latin;
both
Proto-Germanic
and
Late
Latin
forms
are
from
Latin
Cyprium
the
adjective
for
Cyprus
whence
the
best
copper
came
in
antiquity
which
goes
back
to
the
Greeks
who
called
it
kupros
Whereas
both
the
name
of
the
element
in
English
and
its
universal
symbol
come
from
Cyprus
the
name
came
via
Germanic
and
the
symbol
via
Latin
Lead
is
from
ME/OE
lead
West
Germanic
lauda
but
its
ultimate
origin
is
obscure
The
Latin
plumbum
weight
gives
us
the
symbol
Pb
(along
with
words
like
plumb
plumb
bob
and
plumber
one
who
works
with
lead
and
lead
pipes
Silver
is
from
OE
siolfor/seolfor
Proto-Germanic
silubhra
and
may
not
be
an
Indo-European
word
at
all
but
one
borrowed
from
the
Semitic
language
Akkadian
(the
language
of
Babylon):
sarpu
refined
metal
The
symbol
Ag
comes
from
Latin
argentum
from
IE
*arg
meaning
to
shine
or
white
Gold
comes
from
OE
gold
IE
ghel
to
shine
but
in
yellow
sense
(in
contrast
to
arg
which
is
to
shine
in
white
sense)
This
root
or
closely
related
ones
such
as
ghol
yield
whole
slough
of
modern
English
words
via
various
Proto-Germanic
and
related
IE
roots:
yellow
gild
gall
(a
yellowish
substance)
choler
cholera
melancholy
black
bile
and
chlorine
all
via
Greek
kholÃ©
yellow
bile
and
Greek
chlidÃ©
luxury
and
Proto-Germanic
ghhleid
and
glazem:
gleam
glint
glimmer
glisten
glass
glaze
gloss
glance
glade
glee
glow
gloaming
glide
and
glissade
--quite
haul
from
what
is
basically
single
root!
The
symbol
Au
comes
from
Latin
aurum
gold
which
in
turn
comes
from
Indo-European
auso-
gold
but
possibly
meaning
to
draw
water
leading
one
to
speculate
that
ancient
gold
was
found
by
panning
as
in
placer
mining
Finally
group
of
odds
`n'
sods:
nickel
(the
devil's
metal)
from
modern
German
Kupfernickel
copper
demon:
Nickel
is
diminutive
of
Nicklaus
similar
to
the
English
Old
Nick
term
for
the
Devil
so
called
because
nickel
was
considered
contaminant
when
found
in
copper
ore
but
in
the
early
days
of
mining--as
if
the
metal
were
spooked
Once
use
had
been
found
for
nickel
(it
is
what
makes
stainless
steel
stainless
among
other
uses)
it
became
desirable
metal;
but
its
ore
was
found
to
have
gremlin
in
it
which
turned
out
to
be
cobalt
Kobalt
in
German)
The
German
word
for
gremlin
is
Kobold
an
underground
sprite
believed
to
put
curses
on
ore
Although
several
elements
are
spelled
differently
on
either
side
of
the
anglophone
world
caesium
vs
cesium
for
instance)
only
aluminium
is
both
spelled
and
pronounced
differently
Aluminium
is
so
spelled
outside
North
America
(except
by
the
Canadian
aluminum
giant
Alcan
Aluminium
)
The
metal
was
identified
in
1808
by
Sir
Humphry
Davy
who
originally
named
it
alumium
based
on
Latin
alumen
and
alum
oxides
and
sulphates
of
aluminum
respectively
which
were
known
to
the
ancients
Four
years
later
however
Davy
changed
his
mind
and
called
the
element
aluminum
which
he
felt
more
closely
resembled
the
Latin
roots
The
word
was
transformed
in
aluminium
in
Britain
because
it
seemed
more
classically
consistent
There
is
another
element--tungsten--which
used
to
be
known
as
wolfram
in
Britain
although
this
has
been
supplanted
by
tungsten
It
is
not
considered
proper
to
name
elements
after
oneself
but
others
can
name
an
element
after
you
if
you
are
dead
and
sufficiently
famous
Or
you
could
arrange
to
have
an
element
named
after
your
hometown
or
your
country:
Scandium
Polonium
Europium
Francium
Americium
Germanium
Berkelium
Californium
Yttrium
and
Ytterbium
the
last
two
being
elements
named
after
the
Swedish
town
where
they
were
discovered
Elements
named
after
scientists
include
Curium
Mendelevium
Einsteinium
Nobelium
(actually
this
was
named
after
Sweden's
Nobel
Institute
not
directly
after
Alfred
Nobel)
and
Lawrencium
However
there
is
another
element
whose
nomenclature
breaks
the
rules
thanks
to
trick
its
discoverer
played
on
the
world
The
19th-century
French
chemist
Paul
Emile
Lecoq
de
Boisbaudran
managed
to
name
Gallium
after
himself
(because
of
course
Coq
in
Latin
is
Gallus
!)
As
gallium
is
the
only
other
metal
besides
mercury
which
is
liquid
at
room
temperature
and
since
liquid
metals
have
slightly
shady
reputation
perhaps
Lecoq's
trick
was
poetically
apt

only

When

However
it
was
only

5,000
years
ago
that
Homo
loquens
hit
upon
writing
down
some
of
the
Babelian
babble
around
him--and
there
has
been
no
stopping
him
since!
Presumably
Sumerian
or
Egyptian
accountants--no
boob-bookkeepers
they!--first
substituted
signs
for
pictographs
giving
them
phonetic
instead
of
semantic
values
Literati
of
the
day
decided
they
too
could
use
these
new-fangled
marks
for
something
besides
counting
cows
setting
in
motion
another
logorrhoeic
avalanche
that
has
continued
to
snowball
ever
since
Speech
and
writing
as
inextricably
joined
as
paper's
two
surfaces
are
different
forms
of
the
same
singular
phenomenon
distinguishing
humans
from
all
other
creatures
on
earth
Yet
while
the
garrulous
gabble
continues
everywhere
constant
and
unabated
writing
still
eludes
half
the
world's
population
for
whom
marks
on
any
medium
remain
inscrutable
impenetrable
indecipherable
cryptography
Writing
is
symbol
of
the
sounds
(Aristotle
Categories
)
But
the
discrepancies
between
language
in
its
spoken
and
written
forms
are
often
blatant
The
symbols
of
any
writing
system

Two
books
of
recent
vintage
reflecting
this
ongoing
fascination
are:
The
Alphabet
Abecedarium
The
Story
of
Writing
The
Alphabet
Abecedarium
is
the
bibliophile's
answer
to
the
botanist's
stroll
through
the
garden
being
an
eminently
enjoyable
omnium

of
recondite
recherchÃ©
and
obscure
arcana
and
lore
about
the
letters
of
our
Latin
alphabet
written
in
light
conversational
self-deprecatory
tongue-in-cheek
style
After
brief
history
of
the
alphabet
each
of
the
twenty-six
succeeding
chapters
is
devoted
to
single
letter
with
final
one
discussing
signs
and
symbols
Firmage
recounts
the
development
of
each
letter
from
its
first
protoplastic
attestation
on
through
its
often
protean
metamorphoses
over
the
millennia
In
an
engaging
wide-ranging
display
of
erudition
Firmage
discusses
the
letters'
symbological
values
in
such
diverse
parlances
as
chemistry
music
ancient
and
modern
mysticism
(including
far
too
much
New
Age
material
for
my
tastes)
while
quotes
from
such
diverse
figures
as
Joyce
Rabelais
Dostoyevsky
Bob
Dylan--and
Elmer
Fudd--interlard
the
text
Firmage's
main
interest
in
this
pleasant
potpourri
is
in
aesthetics:
the
letters'
shapes
and
designs
Extrapolating
on
the
theories
of
the
Renaissance
designer
Geofroy
Tory
as
expounded
in
his
Champ

(1529)
Firmage
takes
Tory's
sketches
as
the
springboard
for
his
analysis
of
the
letter-shapes
and
the
sometimes
highly
stylized
forms
they
assume
throughout

their
inchoate

Robinson's
The
Story
of
Writing
is
almost
coffee-table-sized;
it
is
elegantly
designed
and
richly
illustrated
After
presenting
various
systems
of
communication
(signs
pictographs
rebuses
shorthand
tallies
Babylonian
clay
tokens
Peruvian
quipus)
Robinson
discusses
such
ancient
and
now
defunct
but
decipherable
writing
systems
as
Sumerian
cuneiform
Egyptian
hieroglyphs
Minoan
Greek
Linear
B
and
Mayan
glyphs;
ditto
some
of
the
more
outstanding
conundra
awaiting
decipherment--Cretan
Linear
A
Proto-Elamite
Etruscan
and
the
Easter
Island
and
Indus
scripts

From
Hieroglyphs
to
Alphabets--and
Back?
the
title
of
Robinson's
concluding
chapter
is
not
an
entirely
rhetorical
question
Only
twenty
years
ago
did
those
now
ubiquitous
and--depending
on
how
one
perceives
them--
exuberantly
eloquent
or
infuriatingly
laconic
logos
begin
to
appear
on
highway
and
street
signs;
in
terminals
(do
kilted
Scots
or
slacks-clad
women
ever
end
up
in
the
wrong
lavatories?);
computer
screen
displays;
and
instruction
manuals
for
electr(on)ic
gadgetry
Similarly
architectural
musical
mathematical
astronomical
chemical
notation
dance
and
circuit
diagrams
are
replete
with
symbols
some
scholars
place
on
par
with
proto-scripts
implying
that
after
5,000
years
of
literary
lucubrations
and
scriveners'
scribblings
we
are
leaving
the
Age
of
Writing
and
entering
post-modern
Age
of
Logography
Succinctly
stated
the
basic
underlying
question
is
How
do
we
(who
use
alphabets)
read?
Conversely
how
did
the
ancient
Sumerians
Egyptians
and
how
do
present-day
Chinese
Japanese
and
Koreans
read?
Athanasius
Kircher's
(1602-1680)
and
Joseph
de
Guignes'
(1721-1800)
fanciful
descriptions
of
Chinese
signs
and
Egyptian
hieroglyphs
gave
birth
to
the
notion
that
these
writing
systems
could
somehow
circumvent
pedestrian
alphabets
going
as
it
were
straight
to
the
heart
of
things
Since
then
the
myth
has
persisted
that
here
encoded
in
these
quasi-representational
forms
was
the
quintessence
of
thought
the
eternal
Platonic
ideal
the
Jungian
Ur-
symbol
underlying
all
human
cogitation--and
by
extrapolation
speech--the
(al)lure
of
the
fabulous
(Far)
East
playing
an
obvious
role
Linguistic
research
has
proven
however
that
such
notions
are
entirely
false
Hieroglyphs
and
logographs
are
just
as
much
phonetic-based
scripts
as
letters
(which
millennia
ago
were
likewise
pictorial
representations
of
concrete
objects)
That
hieroglyphs
and
logographs
sometimes
contain
significant
visual
elements--mnemonic
aids
to
jog
the
memory
and
set
the
synapses
swinging--is
icing
on
the
cake
First
and
foremost
hieroglyphs
and
logographs
are
read
as
sounds
not
symbols
as
my
seven-year
foray
into
Chinese
has
taught
me
How
the
brain
actually
perceives
writing
of
any
shape
is
question
spanning
wide
variety
of
disparate
disciplines
cognitive
sciences
(neuropsycho-)
linguistics
and
-biology
the
debate
ongoing
and
controversy-laden
Visible
speech
regardless
whether
alphabetic
or
logographic
with
all
its
faults
and
foibles
its
inherent
inconsistencies
inadequacies
and
inaccuracies
it
seems
is
here
to
stay
All
Gone
Pear-Shaped:
Opportunities
for
Misunderstanding
the
Police
One
of
my
first
and
most
vivid
impressions
after
becoming
London
police
officer
was
the
exceptional
richness
of
police
jargon
It
also
struck
me
as
odd
in
view
of
how
inventive
and
amusing
this
jargon
is
how
little
is
used
for
background
colour
in
TV
police
dramas
and
when
the
programme-makers
use
it
at
all
how
often
they
get
it
wrong
For
instance
fictional
police
are
always
talking
about
their
being
in
the
Force
whereas
real
police
never
talk
about
the
force
it
is
always
simply
the
job
So
an
off-duty
officer
stopped
in
speed
trap
will
try
to
escape
by
murmuring
to
the
traffic
officer
I'm
in
the
job
mate
or
perhaps
just
I'm
job
When
his
pals
ask
him
about
it
they
will
say
Were
you
in
job
car?
Officers
perennially
gripe
about
the
abrasive
and
unsympathetic
qualities
of
job
toilet
paper
Even
the
house
journal
of
Britain's
largest
force
the
London
Metropolitan
Police
is
called
simply
The
Job
Similarly
no
real
police
officer
has
in
my
hearing
ever
referred
to
his
territory
as
either
his
manor
or
his
patch
both
terms
being
the
norm
in
British
cop
shows
In
fact
policemen
always
speak
of
their
ground
an
officer
might
ask
his
pal
Do
you
know
pub
called
the
Rhinoceros?
and
his
friend
will
reply
Of
course
do:
it's
on
my
ground
Returning
from
foray
outside
his
own
station's
area
one
officer
will
say
to
another
Ah
we're
back
on
the
ground
again
Another
term
much
beloved
of
TV
dramatists
is
Super
for
Superintendent
and
its
logical
next
step
Chief
Super
the
Super's
on
his
way
In
reality
police
never
abbreviate
this
rank
I've
no
idea
why;
they
just
don't
It
is
always
the
Superintendent
or
He's
Chief
Superintendent
now
In
conversation
however
the
Superintendent
or
Chief
Superintendent
in
charge
of
station
is
almost
invariably
referred
to
as
simply
the
guv'nor
and
he
and
his
entourage
of
supervising
officers
down
to
and
including
Inspectors
are
collectively
the
governors
The
Inspector
running
shift
of
operational
officers
is
also
the
guv'nor
By
contrast
no
one
of
any
rank
ever
addresses
someone
of
the
rank
of
Constable
as
Constable:
in
direct
address
he
will
simply
be
addressed
by
name
or
in
more
formal
contexts
by
his
number:
601
report
to
the
Chief
Superintendent
for
annual
qualification
review
at
3.00
pm
In
indirect
reference
the
body
of
Constables
is
always
referred
to
as
the
PCs
mentioned
individually
in
such
terms
as
He's
PC
on
Division
My
son's
in
the
job:
he's
PC
at
Wembley
Sergeants
are
addressed
from
time
to
time
as
Sarge
but
much
more
usually
as
Skipper
or
Skip
and
they
are
always
referred
to
indirectly
as
such:
He's
skipper
on
division
Inspectors
and
Chief
Inspectors
are
never
abbreviated
or
otherwise
jargonized
As
for
the
most
stratospheric
ranks
of
all
ending
with
the
Commissioner
himself
they
are
known
collectively
as
the
brass
The
PCs
are
divided
into
reliefs
each
working
rotation
of
early
late
and
night
shifts
Shift
however
is
word
that
is
not
used
by
the
police:
early
and
late
duties
are
known
as
early
and
late
turn
but
nights
are
always
night
duty
or
plain
nights
Early
turn
is
generally
known
colloquially
as
early
worm
but
the
other
two
have
no
sobriquets
Any
single
period
of
work
is
tour
(of
duty)
Before
your
tour
you
get
into
your
uniform
including
your
bonnet
(helmet--but
never
the
flat
cap
used
on
motorized
patrol)
your
stick
(truncheon
including
the
new
American-style
nightsticks)
and
your
uniform
jacket
(not
strictly
jargon
term
but
another
case
of
police-public
divide
in
that
the
public
nearly
always
call
it
tunic
which
is
never
used
by
the
police
themselves)
You
also
put
on
your
PR
personal
radio
At
one
time
this
was
called
the
Batphone
but
that
term
has
dropped
out
of
use
The
building
where
all
this
takes
place
is
never
referred
to
as
anything
other
than
the
nick
That
is
also
the
commonest
of
many
names
for
prison
and
the
one
almost
invariably
used
by
police
Anyone
held
in
police
custody
is
banged
up
Nick
is
the
universal
verb
for
the
act
of
arrest:
the
polite
courtroom
phrase
arrested
and
cautioned
him
is
almost
invariably
euphemism
for
the
words
actually
spoken
by
PC
to
the
prisoner
on
the
street
are
You're
nicked--suitably
adverbially
embellished
if
the
prisoner
has
caused
the
PC
to
run
fight
or
lose
his
breath
prisoner
is
body
as
in
Any
mobile
unit
available
to
so
to
Trafalgar
Square
to
pick
up
601
with
body?
But
you
never
arrest
body
or
even
nick
him:
you
always
get
body
You
may
also
feel
his
collar
or
more
commonly
have
him
off
and
if
it
is
for
anything
other
than
drunkenness
you
get
crime
knock
Crime
knocks
often
flow
from
observations
Here
is
another
example
of
the
TV
people
(and
the
newspapers)
getting
it
wrong:
they
always
refer
to
the
police
as
keeping
an
observation
Police
on
the
other
hand
never
say
that
always
doing
an
obbo
One
thing
however
is
certain:
however
he
came
to
be
arrested
the
body
is
always
thenceforward
referred
to
as
Chummy
Many
crimes
are
invariably
referred
to
by
initials
some
of
which
belong
to
offences
that
have
been
super-seded--a
good
example
of
jargon's
proving
more
tenacious
of
life
than
the
things
from
which
it
arises
For
example
someone
arrested
for
the
offence
of
going
equipped
for
theft
is
still
known
by
the
initials
of
the
old
offence
of
carrying
House
Breaking
Implements
by
night
from
the
Larceny
Acts
though
they
were
repealed
decades
ago
Thus
had
him
off
for
HBI
You
might
also
have
him
off
for
TDA
(Taking
and
Driving
Away
now
replaced
by
Taking
conveyance
)
or
for
OPD
(Outraging
Public
Decency)
IPO
(Impersonating
Police
Officer)
or
for
the
better-known
ABH
or
GBH
(assaults
occasioning
Actual
or
Grievous
Bodily
Harm)
And
there
are
many
others
If
you
have
had
someone
off
for
some
of
the
more
serious
of
these
crimes
it
is
likely
that
you
will
be
in
plain
clothes
In
that
case
you
need
to
identify
yourself
as
job
to
Chummy
You
do
this
by
flashing
your
brief
which
means
in
practice
waving
under
his
nose
bit
of
plastic
that
is
actually
your
warrant
card
but
as
far
as
Chummy
knows
might
be
anything
and
announcing
that
he's
nicked
When
he
gets
to
the
nick
he
will
then
holler
for
brief
of
an
entirely
different
kind
namely
his
lawyer--a
solicitor;
and
if
the
case
goes
as
far
as
court
the
brief
will
very
likely
have
engaged
mouthpiece
--in
Britain
barrister
in
the
USA
trial
lawyer--to
speak
for
him
Some
crime
knocks
are
wrongful
and
sometimes
officers
have
been
known
to
arrest
on
sight
someone
they
feel
sure
is
at
it
and
decide
later
on
what
they
have
arrested
him
for
sometimes
even
planting
evidence
This
is
known
in
copspeak
as
being
swift
or
as
swifting
someone
off
for
whatever
it
is
that
is
later
decided
upon
Or
you
may
tell
your
pals
in
the
canteen
later
that
you
had
him
off
under
the
[or
whichever]
Division
Breathing
Act
or
under
the
Refusal
of
Particulars
Act
More
frequent
is
the
custom
of
claiming
that
Chummy
said
something
self-incriminating
on
arrest
This
is
known
as
verballing
him
up
Any
such
behaviour
is
often
described
as
bent
as
in
bent
copper
but
among
police
themselves
the
common
term
for
such
an
arrest
is
see
old
so-and-so
got
well
and
truly
stitched
up
for
theft
from
vehicles
This
is
yet
another
case
where
police
and
public
part
company:
the
media
always
talk
of
bent
police
fitting
up
innocent
arrestees
The
police
never
use
that
term
always
stitch
up
The
term
fit
up
was
as
far
as
can
ascertain
coined
by
the
novelist
G.F
Newman
in
his
story
of
bent
detective
Sir
You
Bastard
but
it
is
the
one
that
has
caught
on
at
the
expense
of
the
real
police
term
police
officer
caught
going
bent
will
get
into
trouble
Whether
or
not
he
ends
up
in
court
he
will
certainly
be
the
subject
of
internal
disciplinary
proceedings
He
will
describe
himself
however
as
having
been
stuck
on
this
being
short
for
stuck
on
the
dab
Or
he
may
use
the
other
half
for
his
abbreviation
and
say
I'm
going
on
the
dab
for
this
The
term
comes
from
the
word
dabs
fingerprints
which
are
taken
from
prisoner
by
police
only
after
arrest
for
fairly
serious
crime
And
an
officer
who
has
been
stuck
on
may
well
be
heard
lamenting
that
It's
all
gone
pearshaped
--which
is
what
happens
when
anything
that
should
have
fine
firm
shape
sags
with
all
the
stuffing
leaking
down
into
the
bottom
and
flopping
outwards
Having
initially
been
stuck
on
the
errant
PC
will
soon
receive
the
official
form
warning
him
that
he
may
be
subject
to
disciplinary
proceedings
Like
all
large
bureaucracies
the
police
flounder
in
an
ocean
of
paper
with
form
for
every
action
The
one
for
this
warning
of
possible
discipline
is
Form
No
163
so
the
PC
can
now
say
of
himself
I've
been
one-six-three'd;
and
bit
later
when
the
senior
officer
assigned
to
investigate
the
complaint
decides
that
there
is
enough
evidence
to
justify
hearing
(which
he
always
does)
comes
the
even
more
dreaded
next
stage
I've
been
one-six-foured
--i.e.
given
notice
of
the
date
of
the
disciplinary
hearing
You
can
be
stuck
on
for
anything
from
serious
misconduct
to
minor
infringements
of
the
police's
absurdly
draconian
and
catch-all
disciplinary
codes
which
make
it
possible
for
senior
officer
with
grudge
against
junior
to
stick
him
on
for
almost
anything
For
example
the
PC
may
have
been
caught
slipping
unobtrusively
into
restaurant
or
pub
on
his
ground
to
scrounge--otherwise
ponce
or
mump
--a
drink
or
meal
Every
PC
cultivates
his
own
special
places
for
this
purpose:
they
are
his
own
preserve
and
forbidden
to
other
PCs;
he
will
refer
to
them
as
his
ponce-holes
and
they
add
greatly
to
the
sum
of
constabular
happiness
(Mine
included
the
Savoy
Hotel.)
Other
things
for
which
one
might
go
on
the
dab
include
scrounging
provender
from
markets
the
produce
being
known
as
codgel
associating
with
the
wrong
kind
of
company
which
is
to
say
actions
like
boozing
with
known
criminals
or
CRO
men
(CRO
stands
for
Criminal
Records
Office
The
office
itself
has
been
given
an
impressive
new
name
but
the
old
initials
survive
it.)
So
might
talk
of
your
friends
with
criminal
convictions
as
your
CRO
mates
Police/public
again:
the
cop
shows
and
newspapers
always
describe
these
friends
of
yours
as
having
form
The
police
always
talk
of
previous
Having
either
Chummy
will
of
course
have
docket
number
at
CRO
or
its
computerized
replacement;
any
police
officer
however
will
still
say
Well
well
well!
He's
got
club
number
Having
nicked
Chummy
the
police
may
wish
to
search
his
property
for
the
proceeds
of
his
crimes
If
he
refuses
his
permission
for
them
to
do
so
they
will
get
(warrant)
from
magistrate
or
in
some
parts
Panel
of
experts
bench
of
lay
justices
Then
they
will
go
and
give
his
drum
spin
or
just
spin
him
search
his
home
Whether
or
not
they
find
anything
they
will
eventually
get
into
half-blues
civilian
jacket
over
job
shirt
and
trousers
and
go
off
to
the
pub
for
well-earned
pint;
and
if
you
eavesdrop
on
their
conversation
since
policemen
always
talk
shop
you
will
undoubtedly
overhear
some
of
the
expressions
you
have
been
introduced
to
here
No
one
expected
it
to
be
that
high
but
it's
lower
than
what
we
expected

How
long
is
it
since
you
turned
round
and
gave
someone
good
earful?
And
did
he
or
she
turn
round
and
give
as
good
as
they
got?
You
might
turn
round
to

and
say
you

You
may
find
this

to
be

Certainly
it

The
piÃ¨ce-de-rÃ©sistance
of
the

however
came
when
my

me
of

(or
should
that
be

between
herself

her

After
an

she
delivered
the
knockout
punch
with
the
following:

it

that
Mr

The

his
misquotation

never

apart
from
being
called

my

pals
the
name
never
caused
any

That
was
before

It

It
is
not

that
my
first

to
say
it
is
in

that
one
of
the
really
weird

hiccups
occurs
It
usually
happens
in
restaurants
or
hotels
or
any
of
the
other
places
where
professional
name
takers
are
found
The
conversation
usually
goes
something
like
this:
Good

Could
have
your
name
please?
Yes
I'm
John
Thorpe
OK
Mr
Philips
I've
put
your

No
no
My

is

not
Philips

Yewer
Jarn
Thorwup
Gee
I'm

that
conversation
may
sound
unbelievable
but
in
the
US
have
been
renamed
Philips
dozens
of
times
on
the
West
coast
particularly
So
often
in
fact
that
have
been
forced
to
assume
the
new
identity
of
the
more
acceptable
Jarn
Thorwup
when
dealing
with
any
of
the
name
takers
so
deeply
entrenched
in
the
American
way
of
doing
things
How
can
they
hear
it
that
way?
It
is
not
as
though
Thorpe
is
that
unusual
name
in
the
States:
after
all
one
of
the
great
athletes
of
all
time
was
Jim

But
they

ANTIPODEAN
ENGLISH
The
ABC
of
Broadcasting
Australian
Australia's
national
broadcaster
the
Australian
Broadcasting
Corporation
[ABC]
has
had
advice
on
its
use
of
English
for
more
than
half
century
The
advising
body
the
Standing
Committee
on
Spoken
English
[SCOSE]
has
in
recent
years
been
made
up
of
four
categories
of
member:
broadcasters
[practitioners];
bureaucrats
[facilitators];
academics
[linguistic
experts];
and
representatives
of
the
wider
community
The
committee
is
generally
held
in
high
regard
but
ran
aground
when
four
out
of
five
of
the
outside
members
resigned
earlier
this
year
Their
action
raises
two
questions
The
first
is
general
one:
what
sort
of
standardisation
or
regulation
does
community
expect
or
tolerate
in
the
language
its
broadcasters
use?
The
second
is
more
local
and
specific
to
the
set
of
circumstances
pertaining
in
the
ABC:
why
does
committee
which
has
had
useful
and
influential
life
for
more
than
fifty
years
suddenly
reach
crisis
point
at
which
significant
proportion
of
its
members
are
prepared
to
gamble
on
an
incoming
General
Manager's
reassessment
of
its
role
and
put
at
risk
its
very
existence?
To
take
the
general
question
first
let
us
begin
with
little
history
SCOSE
began
its
life
in
1943
as
the
Pronunciation
Advisory
Committee
It
was
concerned
with
the
maintenance
of
standard
English
pronunciations
as
those
then
believed
to
be
most
suitable
for
broadcasting
Standard
English
meant
the
King's
English
and
in
this
outpost
of
Empire
announcers
(though
unseen)
wore
dinner
suits
to
read
the
news
and
abided
by
the
rulings
of
the
English
phonetician
Daniel
Jones
whose
tremendously
influential
English
Pronouncing
Dictionary
was
first
published
in
1917
Enter
young
Australian
phonetician
Alex
Mitchell
later
to
become
the
founding
Vice-Chancellor
of
Macquarie
University
and
in
that
capacity
to
appoint
Arthur
Delbridge
later
to
become
Chief
Editor
of
the
Macquarie
Dictionary
as
Macquarie's
first
Professor
of
English
and
Linguistics
In
1952
on
the
recommendation
of
an
internal
committee
set
up
to
consider
the
desirability
of
the
ABC's
making
some
departure
from
BBC
practice
the
Standing
Committee
on
Pronunciation
was
established
to
(and
the
wording
is
historic)
advise
the
Corporation
on
the
most
acceptable
pronunciation
of
those
words
for
which
[the]
current
Australian
pronunciation
differs
from
the
pronunciation
recorded
by
Daniel
Jones
The
committee
was
named
the
Standing
Committee
on
Spoken
English
in
1954
Mitchell
and
Delbridge
being
successive
chairmen
of
SCOSE
during
its
formative
years
Over
the
years
this
committee
has
vigilantly
assessed
its
utility
several
times
reviewing
its
aims
and
procedures
(in
1971
1983
1987
and
1989)
Its
revised
terms
of
reference
are:
to
advise
the
Corporation
on
its
use
of
Spoken
English
in
broadcasting
with
special
reference
to
pronunciation
grammatical
usage
and
style;
and
to
prepare
for
publication
in
electronic
or
print
form
such
specialised
guides
to
the
use
of
English
or
other
languages
as
necessary
Its
primary
goal
has
been
the
provision
of
expert
advice
to
broadcasters--on
the
pronunciation
of
names
place
names
foreign
words
words
from
specialist
vocabularies
as
various
as
music
and
sport
the
Church
and
medicine
etc
Daily
lists
of
words
that
are
likely
to
give
broadcaster
the
conniptions
are
constantly
being
added
to
huge
database
which
is
electronically
available
to
all
broadcasters
Nor
has
the
committee
shirked
the
responsibility
thrust
on
it
by
the
public
or
avoided
public
controversy
It
has
taken
on
(over
the
pronunciation
of
kilometre)
Australia's
most
loquacious
Prime
Minister
Gough
Whitlam
and
fearlessly
determined
an
Australian
pronunciation
of
words
as
divers
as
Jervis
Bay
Chernobyl
and
Quixote
It
has
developed
and
sustained
public
role
for
itself
as
its
numerous
correspondents
will
testify
It
has
watched
over
and
in
very
low-key
way
guided
the
development
of
recognisable
and
accepted
Australian
standard
It
has
not
been
without
influence
on
the
ABC's
commercial
rivals
It
seems
reasonable
to
assume
that
it
is
valued
by
the
community
Where
committee
can
lose
its
way
no
matter
how
intrinsically
valuable
its
deliberations
is
in
its
communication
with
its
users
(or
should-be
users)
One
problem
is
the
receptivity
of
new
generation
of
broadcaster
that
thinks
SCOSE
ivory-towerish
and
its
recommendations
arcane
and
irrelevant
in
world
where
information
matters
more
than
its
expression
second
has
been
the
maintenance
of
communicating
mechanism
within
the
Organisation
which
has
been
dependent
on
support
from
within
the
ABC's
management
structure
In
its
heyday
SCOSE
was
chaired
by
one
of
the
academic
members
which
gave
it
certain
impartiality
and
independent
force
and
the
circulation
of
its
findings
was
the
responsibility
of
senior
ABC
officer
and
trained
secretary-cum-research
assistant
who
was
the
servant
of
the
committee
and
who
reported
to
that
officer
Most
recently
it
has
been
chaired
by
senior
officer
alternately
the
Head
of
Radio
(who
has
rarely
been
able
to
attend
meetings)
and
the
Head

Many
thanks
for
the
very
kind
gift
of
the
number
of
VERBATIM
containing
the
long
and
very
amusing
article
on
my
grandfather
Professor
Walter
W
Skeat
[The
(invariably)
Right
Reverence
Walter
W
Skeat
XVIII
1,16]
From
what
was
told
many
years
ago
he
was
constantly
deluged
with
letters
from
complete
strangers
demanding
to
be
told
the
etymology
of
various
words
and
am
not
at
all
surprised
that
he
should
have
shown
irritation
with
those
who
had
not
even
taken
the
elementary
steps
of
consulting
either
his
own
dictionary
or
the
N.E.D
These
however
were
the
easy
ones
and
could
be
answered
very
briefly
When
asked
for
the
derivation
of
word
of
which
the
etymology
had
not
been
worked
out
he
adopted
rationing
system:
he
did
the
best
he
could
with
the
resources
available
in
his
study
in
the
space
of
half
an
hour
The
result
was
then
communicated
to
his
correspondent
whose
letter
would
then
be
dropped
into
the
wastepaper
basket!
This
was
necessary
because
otherwise
his
work
would
have
brought
to
standstill
Of
course
personal
acquaintances
were
not
treated
in
such
cavalier
fashion
and
he
must
have
accumulated
an
enormous
correspondence
virtually
none
of
which
has
survived
except
for
his
letters
from
Sir
James
Murray
who
with
great
presence
of
mind
on
hearing
of
my
grandfather's
death
recovered
the
letters
which
he
had
sent
him
Both
sides
of
this
lifetime
correspondence
are
now
in
the
possession
of
his
granddaughter
Miss
K
M
E
Murray
who
has
made
arrangements
in
her
will
to
bequeath
them
to
the
Bodleian
Apart
from
these
all
his
vast
correspondence
seems
to
have
been
destroyed
apart
from
few
stray
items
which
have
descended
to
me
say
destroyed
because
recall
having
been
told
many
years
ago
that
after
his
death
his
two
sons
(my
father
and
my
uncle)
spent
weeks
tearing
up
old
letters
Robert
Adams
writes
[XXII,2]
of
the
much-celebrated
Stoat
as
if
Heironymous
were
still
anonymous
am
astonished
that
Adams
has
been
unaware
of
Stoat's
new
career
Mr
Stoat
has
been
profiled
several
times
in
Tqydrtk
Magazine
among
other
places
In
those
articles
he
spoke
of
his
frustration
with
words
inevitably
creating
meaning
in
the
minds
of
literate
readers
and
his
search
for
an
audience
neither
literate
nor
readers
Possibly
Cardiff
has
been
spared
MTV
but
we
haven't
The
idea
that
words
strung
together
will
inevitably
make
some
sort
of
sense
and
conjure
connections
in
reader's
mind
has
been
vanquished
by
MTV
Stoat's
insight
was
to
mate
words
without
apparent
meaning
to
video
images
that
move
so
rapidly
and
have
so
little
intrinsic
activity
(as
opposed
to
action
of
which
there
is
plenty)
that
no
one
can
imagine
what
they're
about
There
is
no
time
for
reflection
and
savoring
no
desire
to
be
bombarded
again
Nouns
are
often
paired
but
in
ways
that
guarantee
incomprehension
For
instance
in
one
of
his
famous
videos
haddock
(or
some
other
large
fish)
was
on
the
screen
for
moment
while
vocalist
sic
sang
about
light
bulb
Now
of
course
we
have
been
given
the
key
to
this
complicated
metaphor
Thanks
for
enlightening
us
hope
Mr
Adams
will
explore
this
oeuvre
and
see
how
people
can
take
random
words
sung
to
apparently
random
music
and
accompany
them
by
random
images
Mr
Stoat
has
successfully
broached
the
barricades
of
words

Beating

Once

had
their

remember
exactly

Beating

was
intended
to
establish

at
time
when

The
bumping
of
boys'
heads
had
to
be
suffered
even
when

As
Mairie
Robinson
editor-in-chief
of
The
Concise
Scots
Dictionary
(Aberdeen
University
Press

points
out
in
her
Introduction
Scots
is
more
strongly
differentiated
from
Standard
English
than
any
of
the
English
regional
dialects
in
the
number
of
words
meanings
of
words
and
expressions
not
current
in
Standard
English
in
its
strikingly
different
pronunciation
and
in
the
loyal
affection
with
which
the
Scottish
people
continue
to
embrace
it
Scots
is
not
corruption
of
modern
English;
Scots
and
modern
English
evolved
in
parallel
from
Old
English
with
importations
from
many
other
languages

in

MacIntosh's
story

looking

All
the

are
uniquely

and
are
listed

defined
in
Ms
Robinson's

To
call
the
Scots
tongue
Doric
(meaning
broad
or
rustic)
is
to
perpetuate
the
notion
that
it
is
the
speech
of
uneducated
country
folk
an
idea
still
endorsed
by
snobbish
anglophiles
in
Scotland
Lallans
of
course

lowlands

to
designate

of
the
Scottish
Renaissance
movement
which
is
determined
to
preserve
the
ancient
language
as
an
artistic
medium
Mr
MacIntosh
has
lived
too
long

temptation

Mills

ways
of
thinking
as
she
confronts

politics
of
language-use
head
on
Noting
that
language
is
not
simply
vehicle
for
ideas
but
rather
material
entity
which
may
in
fact
shape
those
ideas
Mills
states
that
further
aim
of
feminist
analysis
is
to
draw
attention
to
and
change
the
way
that
gender
is
represented
since
it
is
clear
that
great
many
of
these
representational
practices
are
not
in
the
interests
of
either
women
or
men
Her
book
establishes
framework
for
such
analysis
designed
both
to
describe
sexism
in
text
and
through
process
she
names
feminist
stylistics
to
deconstruct
the
way
in
which
point
of
view
agency
metaphor
and
other
features
of
the
text
are
unexpectedly
closely
related
to
matters
of
gender
For
lay
readers
and
students
who
are
not
familiar
with
the
prevailing
concepts
of
mainstream
linguistics
stylistics
and
literary
analysis
Mills's
Introduction
provides
helpful
explication
of
current
theories
and
positions
in
these
disciplines
The
opening
chapters
address
such
questions
as
whether
meaning
can
exist
in
text
itself
or
is
more
the
result
of
negotiation
between
reader
and
text;
whether
male
writing
can
be
distinguished
from
female
writing
in
terms
of
formal
linguistic
constituents;
and
how
gender
interacts
with
reader
positioning
that
is
the
ways
text
addresses
and
identifies
its
reader
Mills
research
professor
in
English
at
Sheffield
Hallam
University
looks
at
these
issues
in
relation
to
conventional
models
of
text
in
which
piece
of
written
material
is
treated
as
if
it
existed
in
its
own
right
with
little
reference
to
factors
or
constraints
outside
it--the
socioeconomic
factors
of
gender
and
race
for
example
She
then
develops
feminist
model
which
extends
the
parameters
of
text
into
its
surrounding
context
This
model
she
asserts
makes
space
for
the
possibility
and
in
fact
the
necessity
of
integrating
notions
of
gender
race
and
class
and
also
sociohistorical
and
economic
factors
into
the
analysis
and
indeed
into
the
definition
of
the
text
itself
In
the
second
half
of
the
book
Mills
employs
the
strategies
of
feminist
stylistics
to
expose
the
workings
of
gender
at
three
levels
of
language--the
word
the
phrase
or
sentence
and
larger-scale
discourse
Her
examples
throughout
are
taken
from
widely
diverse
written
materials
both
canonical
and
nonliterary
including
novels
newspaper
articles
advertisements
and
popular
songs
Although
the
book
is
described
lightly
as
tool-kit--
and
indeed
Mills's
Summary
lists
questions
through
which
text
can
be
analyzed
for
its
representations
of
gender--
Feminist
Stylistics
is
complex
many-layered
approach
to
reading
that
enables
reader
to
look
beneath
overt
content
in
order
to
see
hidden
messages
which
while
often
unrecognized
by
both
writer
and
reader
nevertheless
reinforce
and
help
to
legitimatize
stereotypical
notions
about
gender
differences
embedded
in
our
culture
Examining
ready-made
phrases
referring
to
women
or
in
some
cases
men
Mills
cites
for
example
some
familiar
proverbs
woman's
work
is
never
done
seems
to
describe
natural
state
of
affairs
The
message
is
hard
to
counter
because
the
speaker/writer
using
it
does
not
take
responsibility
for
inventing
it
but
merely
calls
on
preexisting
commonsense
knowledge
Thus
if
specific
woman
complains
of
having
too
much
work
to
do
Mills
writes
this
phrase
can
be
used
to
suggest
that
the..
difficulty
of
the
conditions
of
her
[specific]
working
life
is
not
as
important
as
the
general
fact
that
women
always
have
too
much
work
to
do
It
might
further
suggest
that
someone
who
has
at
any
given
time
completed
all
the
tasks
before
her
is
not
by
definition
woman
Also
examined
are
effects
of
the
grammatical
convention
in
English
that
the
masculine
is
the
standard
or
unmarked
form
the
feminine
being
deviant
from
the
norm
One
result
is
the
use
of
generic
words
to
refer
to
males
only
of
which
Mills
gives
ludicrous
examples
like
the
headline
on
news
story
about
AIDS
prevention

the

that

were

which
Chapman
ruefully
glosses
as

He
seems

regard
Haugen's
statement

their

as

Chapman
convinced
by
nautical
and
navigational
evidence
that
the
Mapstone
was
genuine
felt
that
the
other
runestones
of
the
group
must
be
authentic
too
He
managed
to
make
an
appointment
with
Professor
Haugen
who
had
called
them
modern
Haugen
invited
Chapman
to
visit
him
at
his
home
and
in
lengthy
meeting
they
discussed
Chapman's
findings
They
agreed
on
most
matters
regarding
the
runic
characters
and
on
many
features
of
language
But
if
Chapman
had
hoped
to
convert
Einar
Haugen
to
his
own
views
of
the
authenticity
of
the
stones
he
did
not
succeed
for
the
Professor
never
deviated
from
his
conviction
that
they
were
modern
He
agreed
however
to
keep
in
touch
with
Chapman
and
to
answer
whatever
questions
he
had
Chapman
states
(p
ii)
that
Haugen
had
scholar's
open
mind
(a
characteristic
not
ordinarily
perceived
by
him
in
most
scholars)
and
he
seemed
grateful
for
Haugen's
comments
This
lasted
for
number
of
years
(until
Haugen's
death
in
fact)
The
professor
had
not
been
willing
to
provide
complete
translation
for
his
time
and
energy
were
both
consumed
in
number
of
projects
and
obligations
Paul
Chapman
apparently
had
his
own
views
of
how
long
it
took
to
provide
answers
to
runic
questions
and
seems
to
have
in
some
cases
expected
replies
by
return
mail
He
compared
the
text
of
the
Memorial
Stone
with
the
contents
of
two
sagas
(sometimes
called
Vinland
Sagas)
James
E
Knirk
head
of
the
Runic
Archive
of
the
University
of
Oslo
who
read
an
early
draft
of
one
of
Chapman's
articles
(pp
31-32)
questioned
the
validity
of
using
the
evidence
of
the
sagas
which
contain
so
much
fictional
and
fantastic
material
Chapman's
defense
of
his
procedure
is
that
the
two
sagas
on
which
he
based
his
conclusions
were
mostly
factual
and
dealt
to
great
extent
with
navigation
an
area
in
which
he
claims
competence
and
practical
experience
He
seems
not
too
much
at
home
in
matters
of
language
His
subtitle
Study
in
Linguistics
bears
this
out
He
seems
relieved
to
be
able
to
report
that
linguists
had
spent
considerable
time
in
studying
the
runestones
without
significant
results
or
that
they
were
quick
to
call
something
fraudulent
The
book
is
despite
these
strictures
worth
reading
and
judicious
readers
will
probably
separate
the
genuine
from
the
dubious
The
illustrations
are
pleasing
and
informative
and
the
runes
are
neatly
transcribed
The
author
makes
an
interesting
attempt
to
account
for
several
features
of
the
runestones:
the
reason
for
their
being
left
in
Maine
the
presence
of
Danish
and
other
words
in
the
inscriptions
the
implications
of
runic
inscriptions
in
which
oghams
occur
together
with
runes
etc

Chapter
Four
Transforming
One
Word
into
Another
As
he
sees
it
all
of
letterplay
revolves
around
three
simple
operations
by
which
one
word
can
be
transformed
into
another--insertion
deletion
and
rearrangement
of
letters
One
type
of
transformation
the
word
network
grew
out
of
Lewis
Carroll's
word
ladders
(originally
called
doublets)
In
word
ladder
two
words
are
connected
by
changing
one
letter
at
time:
LESS
LOSS
LOSE
LOVE
MOVE
MORE
In
one
type
of
word
network
all
words
of
the
same
length
would
be
connected
at
all
possible
places
The
next
chapter
Alphabetical
Order
and
Scoring
begins
with
discussion
of
the
last
word
in
English
and
examines
forms
that
rely
on
positions
of
the
letters
in
the
alphabet
This
paragraph
by
Allan
Simmons
is
an
alphabetic
pun:
Eh!

Jake

You

Why
said?
In
Word
Groups
the
letterplay
shifts
to
words
that
look
ordinary
alone
but
become
unusual
in
combination
The
chapter
opens
with
word
squares
and
variations
like
the
compound
word

invented
by
Hairy

The
chapter
on
Number
Words
explores
the
fascinating
things
that
happen
when
words
and
numbers
collide
Many
of
the
resulting
forms
are
ideal
for
computer
letter-crunching

The
Afterword
concludes
with
look
at
words
as
single
entities
It
is
divided
into
two
sections--geometric
views
of
words
and
discussion
of
long
words
Making
the
Alphabet
Dance
is
the
manifesto
of
man
whose
love
for
words
goes
far
beyond
twenty-six
letters
One
of
the
most
important
wordplay
books
of
the
20th
century
it
gives
name
to
letterplay
and
traces
its
evolution
Although
the
field
is
complex
both
expert
and
novice
can
make
new
discoveries
And
that
Eckler
would
be
the
first
to
say
is
exciting:
One
of
the
great
joys
of
recreational
linguistics
is
the
chance
to
do
original
work
to
discover
new
techniques
or
better
examples
illustrating
old
ones
Such
contributions
can
even
be
made
by
the
diligent
newcomer
to
the
field;
it
is
not
always
necessary
to
serve
long
apprenticeship
mastering
past
results

The

is
very
readable
book
about
English
words
though
from
the
notes
at
the
ends
of
chapters
one
infers
that
it
was
intended
as
an
informal
text
The
reader
gets
the
impression
though
the
author
educated
at
Oxford
and
London
universities
was
Professor
of
Applied
Linguistics
at
the
University
of
Hong
Kong
that
the
book
is
either
for
beginning
linguists
or
for
interested
parties
from
other
disciplines
It
suffers
from
one
severe
reprehensible
shortcoming:
it
lacks
an
index
something
no
book
should
be
without
The
book
is
short
and
simple
but
not
simplistic
(a
word
used
by
some
these

to
avoid
over-simplified
);
it
is
divided
into
fourteen

By
Their
Notes
Ye
Shall
Know
Them:
Look
at
Onomatopoeic
Ornithonymy
According
to
the
great
Danish
linguist
Otto
Jespersen
there
are
five
theories
to
account
for
the
origin
of
language:
the
bow-wow
theory
in
which
speech
imitated
animal
calls;
the
pooh-pooh
theory
in
which
people
made
instinctive
sounds
through
physical
or
emotional
reactions;
the
dingdong
theory
in
which
people
reacted
to
the
environment;
the
yo-he-ho
theory
in
which
people
spoke
when
working
together;
and
the
la-la
theory
in
which
speech
arose
from
the
romantic
side
of
life
If
bird
names
are
anything
to
go
by
the
bowwow
theory
(perhaps
we
should
call
it
the
tweet-tweet
theory)
rules
the
roost
since
many
birds
are
named
for
their
songs
or
calls
This
even
holds
for
the
generic
cock
hen
and
chick
The
farmyard
cock
is
so
called
for
its
clucks
as
illustrated
by
Chaucer
in
The
Nun's
Priest's
Tale
in
which
Chanticleer
cryde
anon
cok
cok
The
cockerel's
cock-a-doodle-doo
is
an
extension
of
this
as
cock's
crow
The
hen
is
so
called
for
her
singing
with
name
related
to
Latin
canere
to
sing
and
so
to
English
chant
(Chanticleer
though
male
has
name
meaning
one
who
sings
clearly.)
The
chicken
has
name
related
to
that
of
the
cock
with
its
changed
vowel
representing
its
less
powerful
cry
The
chick
as
young
bird
is
named
from
it
Outside
the
farmyard
but
still
(usually)
within
farmland
territory
the
crow
and
rook
are
both
named
for
their
harsh
call
or
caw
and
though
less
common
the
chough
and
the
raven
are
similarly
named
The
chough's
cry
has
been
described
as
kyaw
and
the
raven's
as
prruk
(suggesting
the
name
of
the
physically
related
rook
)
The
corncrake's
cry
has
been
verbalized
as
crex
which
adequately
represents
the
crake
that
is
the
basic
form
of
the
name
Elsewhere
afield
the
curlew
with
its
cry
of
courli
is
obviously
named
as
is
the
cuckoo
whose
name
is
similar
in
many
languages
(French
coucou
German
Kuckuck
Greek
kokkux
Latin
cuculus
)
The
first
part
of
its
name
is
in
fact
directly
related
to
that
of
the
cock
as
the
initial
cuck
of
its
call
corresponds
to
the
farmyard
bird's
cluck
The
jackdaw
also
belongs
to
the
crow
family
(Corvidae
)
and
daw
represents
its
chak
(It
does
it
better
in
Italian
than
English
where
the
bird
is
taccola
from
earlier
tacca
.)
The
first
part
of
its
name
is
the
personal
name
Jack
The
sparrow
does
not
itself
have
an
imitative
name
although
it
was
formerly
nicknamed
Philip
for
its
rapid
twittering
and
chirping
notes
Hence
John
Skelton's
early
16th-century
poem
Phyllyp
Sparowe
lament
by
young
lady
for
her
pet
sparrow
killed
by
cat
with
the
affecting
lines:
Nothynge
it
auayled/To
call
Phylyp
agayne,/Whom
Gyb
our
cat
hath
slayne
Another
bird
with
an
imitative
name
prefixed
by
personal
name
is
the
magpie
Here
pie
is
related
to
Latin
pipere
to
chirp
There
are
other
birds
with
pi
or
its
equivalent
in
their
names
similarly
such
as
the
peewit
pipit
and
even
the
pigeon
True
pigeons
coo
but
the
bird
derives
its
name
from
the
onomatopoeic
base
pip
that
imitates
the
chirp
of
young
bird
(and
that
also
gave
English
pipe
)
Hence
also
the
more
obvious
name
of
the
sandpiper
bird
that
pipes
(or
peeps
on
the
sands
We
are
now
by
the
seaside
where
the
gull
has
name
representing
its
repeated
kyow
kyow
The
seagull
is
also
known
as
the
mew
likewise
an
imitative
name
Another
aquatic
bird
is
the
goose
whose
name
represents
its
distinctive
honk
The
male
of
the
species
the
gander
has
directly
related
name
as
does
the
gannet
Its
cry
is
described
as
barking
arrah
Still
with
the
water
birds
the
heron
is
named
for
its
harsh
cry
rrank;
the
name
itself
is
related
to
that
of
the
hen
The
bittern
is
further
wading
bird;
its
cry
is
usually
described
as
boom
and
the
first
part
of
its
name
from
Latin
butio
represents
this
Yet
another
water
dweller
is
the
garganey
kind
of
duck
Its
name
represents
its
distinctive
quacking
On
dry
land
the
finch
is
named
for
its
prolonged
nasal
tswe-e-e
mostly
clearly
heard
in
the
greenfinch
The
siskin
is
in
the
same
family
and
has
similar
nameâand
indeed
similar
call
harsher
note
is
sounded
by
the
shrike
whose
name
is
related
to
screech
and
shriek
The
quail
is
so
called
not
because
it
is
timid
but
because
the
call
of
the
female
is
double
note
queep
queep
The
quail
is
gamebird
as
is
the
partridge
Its
own
name
is
equally
imitative
not
of
its
voice
but
of
the
sharp
whirring
sound
made
by
its
wings
when
it
suddenly
flies
up
This
sounds
like
fart
related
word
(Compare
Greek
perdix
partridge
and
perdesthai
to
break
wind.)
Quite
different
sound
is
made
by
the
owl
whose
name
represents
its
familiar
hoot
otherwise
the
final
longer
note
of
its
conventional
call
tu-whit
tu-whoo
English
howl
is
related
word
French
hibou
also
imitates
the
bird's
call
as
does
its
German
name
Eule
diminutive
form
of
Uhu
eagle
owl
Even
the
little
wren
has
an
echoic
name
as
much
more
obviously
does
the
chiffchaff
although
its
chiffs
and
chaffs
are
usually
repeated
in
irregular
order
such
as
chiff
chiff
chiff
chaff
chiff
chaff
rarer
bird
but
also
with
an
obviously
onomatopoeic
name
is
the
hoopoe
Its
far-carrying
poo-poo-poo
is
also
represened
in
its
Latin
name
Upupa
epops
Its
name
evokes
the
equally
exotic
bobolink
bulbul
and
whippoorwill
with
their
clearly
echoic
names
The
last
bird
is
an
American
nightjar
where
jar
is
also
an
imitative
word
referring
to
its
loud
churring
cry
Churr
and
jar
are
related
words.)
The
nightingale
does
not
have
directly
imitative
name
although
the
final-
gale
is
related
to
yell
which
is
undoubtedly
echoic
It
is
tempting
to
relate
the
yellowhammer's
name
to
yammer
(German
jammern
)
referring
to
its
fussy
call
rapid

But
the
origin
of
the
name
is
disputed
(The
first
part
of
the
name
indicates
the
colour
of
the
bird's
head
and
underparts.)

in
this
bouquet
of
bird
names
let
us

There

ups
(like
the

we

kept
adding

without
removing
the

leading
us
not

into

of

at

into

and
of
course
there
have
been
downs
(like
falling

that

Salty
Sayings
from
Cornwall
The

way
with
words
tends

be

salty

old
sayings
are
concerned
with
cutting
people
down
to
size
and
shrewd
thrusts
are
meant
to
find
their
mark!
The
slow-witted
are
often
described
as
Like
Tregony
bandâthree
scats
[beats]
behind
or
as
too
slow
to
carry
cold
dennar
[dinner]
Stronger
still

old
gibe

weth
the
cakes
often
muttered
behind
the
deficient
one's
back
Any
sign
of
putting
on
airs
or
assertiveness
is
frowned
upon
and
one
still
hears
crude
jokes
like
Quietness
is
the
best
noise
as
Uncle
Johnny
said
when
he
knocked
down
his
wife
or
Dressed

Hatch
Mournful
looks

reminder

For
the

blunt
speech

and

hair
like

water
Even
contented
person
is
often
heard
to
say
Ah'm
happy
on

own
dung
heap
with
typical
Cornish
self-mockery
Ask
an
older
inhabitant
for
his
or
her
age
and
you
may
well
get
the
familiar
reply
As
old
as
my
little
finger
and

strong-minded
county

Cornwall
an
individual
may
be
admired
as
being
as
tough
as
Hancock's
motherâan
archetypal
dragon
lady
rooted
in
local
history
Being
Celtic
nation
the
Cornish
cleave
naturally
to
vivid
descriptions
Any
sign
of
restlessness
for
instance
is
summed
up
as
All
of
motion
like
Mulfra
toad
on
red
hot
shovel
and
when
shivering
it
is
case
of
cold
as
quilkin
[frog]
or
chilled
to
the
marra
[marrow]
Although
pushiness
is
not
quality
naturally
approved
of
in
Cornwall
neither
is
undue
modesty:
standing
in
his
own
light
like
the
Mayor

(another
apocryphal
figure)
Pride

Fancies

Laziness

Show

best
side
of

and
Cheer

More
rough

oft

idea
that
someone
has
been

very
like

very
prevalent

No

with
that
ANTIPODEAN
ENGLISH
Settlement
by
Sea
Astride
Port
Jackson
the
city
of
Sydney
marks
the
site
of
the
first
European
settlement
in
Australia
From
Sydney
second
convict
settlement
was
established
at
Hobart
in
Tasmania
To
the
north
on
Moreton
Bay
in
Queensland
Brisbane
was
founded;
to
the
south
on
Port
Phillip
Bay
in
Victoria
Melbourne
Westward
round
the
southern
coast
Adelaide
was
first
approached
from
the
sea
as
was
at
the
western
extreme
Perth
In
time
overland
routes
between
these
cities
(Hobart
of
course
excluded)
were
found
but
for
much
of
the
19th
century
what
are
now
the
capital
cities
of
the
six
Australian
States
were
most
easily
reached
by
sea
In
each
of
these
the
linguistic
situation
obtaining
in
Sydney
was
replicated
The
settlers
quickly
discovered
that
knowledge
of
Dharuk
(the
Aboriginal
language
spoken
in
Sydney)
was
of
no
help
to
them
in
communicating
with
the
local
Aboriginesâunless
the
Aborigines
had
learned
words
from
the
settlers
in
the
belief
that
they
were
English
as
indeed
happened
with
some
pidgin
terms
and
in
the
west
with
boomerang
In
each
new
settlement
therefore
borrowing
began
anew
So
in
Brisbane
dialects
of
Yagara
were
the
first
encountered
and
the
source
of
some
sixteen
loan
words
In
Melbourne
the
Victorian
languages
Wuywurung
(spoken
in
three
dialects
on
the
site
of
Melbourne
and
to
the
north
and
west)
and
Wathawurung
(spoken
on
the
western
side
of
Port
Phillip
Bay)
were
the
first
source
of
borrowings
though
the
surviving
words
number
no
more
than
sixteen
The
language
spoken
on
the
site
of
Adelaide
Gaurna
though
unusually
well
recordedâby
Lutheran
missionaries
who
were
amongst
the
early
settlersâagain
yielded
only
about
ten
loans
The
extremes
are
provided
by
the
nameless
Tasmanian
languages
which
gave
no
more
than
three
words
to
English
and
Nyungar
the
language
spoken
over
quite
large
area
in
the
southwest
of
Western
Australia
but
essentially
the
language
of
the
site
of
Perth
which
has
enriched
English
with
more
than
fifty
loanwords
The
ignorance
surrounding
the
Tasmanian
languages
betrays
the
fact
that
the
relationships
between
convicts
and
later
settlers
and
the
Tasmanian
Aborigines
were
of
hostility
unreached
elsewhere;
the
continuing
fertility
of
Nyungar
by
contrast
results
from
much
happier
and
more
accommodating
relationship
One
has
to
assume
that
the
words
which
had
Sydney-based
currency
in
English
were
known
to
most
colonists
because
they
had
been
encountered
either
in
Sydney
or
in
accounts
of
Sydney
Nonetheless
there
is
sense
in
which
each
new
settlement
meant
new
start
and
consequently
duplication
in
the
nomenclature
of
key
items
Gunyah
the
Dharuk
word
for
dwelling
is
matched
by
the
Melburnian
quamby
verb
meaning
lie
down
camp
and
also
noun
meaning
shelter
by
the
Brisbane
humpy
the
Adelaide
wurley
and
the
Perth
mia
mia
Of
these
hump
is
now
the
most
commonly
used
in
the
general
sense
of
hut
or
temporary
dwelling
whether
of
Aboriginal
or
European
provenance
And
mia
mia
has
been
widely
used
in
Victoria
in
this
sense
and
in
New
Zealand
of
duck-shooter's
hide
But
the
fact
remains
that
despite
this
diversity
the
English
word
hut
enjoyed
greater
currency
than
any
of
the
borrowings
being
the
usual
word
for
the
accommodation
of
the
convict
the
rural
labourer
and
the
itinerant
bushman
Australian
pidgin
acquired
second
negative
borak
used
as
an
alternative
to
baal
or
in
figurative
sense
for
humbug
nonsense
or
rubbish
from
Wathawurung
whence
came
also
an
exclamation
merrygig
well
done
and
coolie
derogatory
term
for
person
who
partnered
an
Aboriginal
woman
It
is
ironic
that
lubra
word
for
black
womanâusually
younger
woman
than
is
connoted
by
the
Dharuk
gin
âwas
one
of
the
few
survivals
of
the
Tasmanian
languages
in
which
it
has
been

the

Each
new
settlement
meant
new
beginning
but
so
limited
was
the
relationship
between
settlers
and
Aborigines
that
there
was
little
progress
beyond
the
Port
Jackson
model
Not
until
travel
by
land
supplemented
and
eventually
replaced
that
by
sea
did
incremental
borrowing
became
at
least
possibility
just
as
the
passage
of
time
meant
that
there
was
likelihood
that
language
would
be
more
fully
and
more
competently
recorded
The
Case
of
Nyungar
Exploration
and
settlement
overland
followed
travel
by
sea
In
particular
once
the
mountain
barrier
had
been
overcome
the
settlers
from
the
Sydney
area
moved
inland
and
to
the
north
Thus
the
languages
of
the
New
South
Wales
inlandâWiradhuri
and
Kamilaroi
and
its
dialect
Yuwaalaraayâformed
part
of
borrowing
continuum
which
began
with
Dharuk
and
which
incorporated
the
Australian
pidgin
which
David
Collins
an
officer
of
the
First
Fleet
had
described
as
barbarous
mixture
of
English
with
the
Port
Jackson
dialect
Words
like
gammon
and
piccaninny
from
English
slang
and
African
pidgin
respectively
joined
range
of
Port
Jackson
words
to
form
pidgin
in
which
limited
communication
was
possible
This
was
added
to
as
it
travelled
north
and
west
by
words
like
yabber
talk
based
on
the
root
ya
-
found
in
Wiradhuri
and
other
languages)
the
Yagara
(Brisbane)
words
bung
dead
humpy
dwelling
and
yacka
work
(as
noun
and
verb)
and
particularly
by
names
for
flora
and
fauna
the
travellers
now
recognized
as
being
commonly
found
in
the
inland
So
Wiradhuri
words
like
corella
and
gang-gang
names
for
cockatoos
kookaburra
kingfisher
boggi
lizard
belah
Casuarina
billabong
anabranch
gilgai
waterhole
and
bondi
club
became
parts
of
everyday
Australian
English
as
did
the
Kamilaroi
words
brolga
crane
budgerigar
small
parrot
coolamon
wooden
vessel
or
basin
gundy
yet
another
word
for
hut
and
towri
country
the
traditional
territory
of
an
Aboriginal
people
the
Yuwaalaraay
words
galah
parrot
and
gidgee
an
acacia
and
words
common
to
Kamilaroi
and
Yuwaalaraay
like
the
names
of
other
species
of
acacia
such
as
boree
and
mulga
When
would-be
poet
writes
the
lines
Where
the
tangled
boree
blossoms
Where
the
gidya
thickets
wave
And
the
tall
yapunyah's
shadow
Rests
upon
the
stockman's
grave
he
has
in
sense
guaranteed
the
currency
of
the
words
he
uses
Much
the
same
sort
of
continuum
exists
in
the
west
where
Nyungar
which
had
number
of
advantages
over
Dharuk
has
provided
for
more
than
150
years
source
of
loan
words
First
the
settlement
in
the
west
took
place
some
forty
years
after
that
in
the
east
and
the
settlers
had
better
idea
of
what
they
were
handling
Second
though
the
language
is
no
longer
spoken
it
was
more
fully
and
more
intelligently
recorded
than
those
first
encountered
And
third
as
matter
of
governmental
policy
Aboriginal
names
for
flora
and
fauna
have
been
preferred
So
for
instance
the
names
of
the
farmed
freshwater
crayfish
koonac
and
marron
have
only
short
histories
of
usage
in
English
coincident
with
their
utility
though
they
were
first
recorded
in
the
19th
century
And
there
are
substantial
lists
of
the
names
of
treesâ
jarrah
karri
mallett
marri
tuart
and
wandoo
âand
of
animalsâ
chuditch
dalgite
dunnart
kumarl
nool-benger
and
numbat
âthat
are
familiar
at
least
in
the
west
There
are
also
words
representative
of
other
areas
of
Aboriginal
life
such
as
boylya
cleverman
or
wise
elder
gnamma
waterhole
kylie
boomerang
miamia
dwelling
monaych
originally
the
name
of
cockatoo
and
by
transference
police
officer
nyoongar
Aboriginal
person
wagyl
the
mythical
rainbow
serpent
wilgie
red
ochre
used
to
paint
the
body
on
ceremonial
occasions
and
wongi
word
for
an
Aboriginal
person
originally
used
around
Kalgoorlie
But
though
the
Nyungar
words
supply
more
comprehensive
picture
of
Aboriginal
life
than
do
the
Dharuk
or
those
from
any
single
inland
language
the
greater
number
of
words
used
to
denote
key
notions
of
Aboriginal
belief
and
life
are
special
uses
of
English
words
like
cleverman
which
has
replaced
words
like
the
Dharuk
koradji
and
the
Nyoongar
boylya
which
are
effectively
obsolete
So
the
Aboriginal
equivalent
of
the
Creation
is
Dreamtime
itself
translation
of

hut
is
preferred
to

to

And
bark

are

the
terms
in
which
they
are

The
language
of
the
invaders
is
the
language
of
choice
except
in
the
artificially
maintained
case
of
the
nomenclature
of
flora
and
fauna
In
other
words
although
the
opportunity
was
there
for
borrowing
on
larger
scale
and
with
degree
of
comprehensiveness
that
had
not
been
achieved
hitherto
it
has
not
been
taken
In
the

elsewhere

the
lexicographical

of
developing

Australia
is
slight
indeed
Proliferating
Plurals
(and
Some
Singular
Substitutions)
It
seems
that
reporters
and
other
writers
and
speakers
have
invented
new
rule:
Whenever
possible
use
plurals
Thus
television
radio
and
newspaper
reporters
tell
us:
Aids
and
assistances
were
given
by
the
Red
Cross
The
conditions
of
the

are
unknown
An
oil
spill

[i.e.

were

Fog

visibilities
today
At
the
same
time
perhaps
from
an
unconscious
discomfort
caused
by
so
many
perplexing
plurals
there
has
been
mini-trend
in
the
opposite
direction
One
form
has
been
the
de
facto
singularization
of
some
commonly
used
words
of
foreign
origin:
bacterium
datum
medium
stratum
It
graffito
LL
(fr
Gk)
phenomenon
Gk
criterion
Though
all
are
currently
being
used
almost
exclusively
in
plural
form
they
are
treated
as
if
they
were
singular
e.g.
bacteria
etc
The
more
usual
form
of
singularizing
appears
when
we
are
told
that
someone
is
no
longer
in
the
good
grace
of
someone
else;
the
ground
for
divorce
was...;
the
supervisor
or
custodian
(i.e.
janitor]
of
school
building
was
also
responsible
for
the
upkeep
of
its
ground
and
one
reporter
evidently
mightily
disturbed
by
the
prevalent
pluralism
even
tried
to
make
singular
noun
still
more
so
by
lopping
off
its
final
specie
of
mammal
(which
one
might
think
is
right
on
the
money)
Though
the
singular
insanity
is
far
outstripped
by
the
multiple
mania
one
can
expect
in
this
age
of
downsizing
to
encounter
more
of
the
less
and
less
of
the
more
What's
In
Name?
This
slightly
enlarged
version
of
Paul
Dickson's
Names
published
by
Delacorte
Press
in
1986
is
light-hearted
collection
of
names
that
the
author
considers
to
be
interesting
for
one
reason
or
another
We
are
invited
to
share
his
delight
in
Embraceable
Zoo
(for
store
selling
toys)
Onan
(Dorothy
Parker's
pet
canary
who
spilled
his
seed)
Robot
Redford
(a
robot
which
once
gave
commencement
address)
and
many
similar
examples
For
most
of
us
these
are
typical
tit-bits
that
raise
passing
smile
when
we
come
across
them
as
column-fillers
in
our
newspapers
To
irrespressible
name-collectors
like
Paul
Dickson
they
bring
the
thrill
of
new
find
that
anyone
who
has
ever
collected
anything
will
understand
have
known
few
name-collectors
in
my
time
and
they
are
an
enthusiastic
bunch
remember
George
Hubbard
showing
me
the
filing
cabinets
in
his
New
York
apartment
crammed
with
lists
of
personal
names
like
Mollie
Panter-Downes
and
Romeo
Yench
also
recall
with
affection
the
late
John
Leaver
who
cycled
around
the
English
countryside
as
boy
collecting
pub-names
He
was
still
collecting
them
in
his
seventies
John
Leaver
is
not
mentioned
in
this
book
which
is
very
thin
on
British
material
Mr
Dickson
says
for
instance
that
he
has
long
had
special
passion
for
apple
names
and
quotes
several
hundred
of
them
but
he
ignores
the
National
Apple
Register
of
the
United
Kingdom
by
uriel
W.G
Smith
which
catalogues
the
names
of
22,000
cultivars
(Miss
Smith
once
amused
herself
by
working
365
apple
names
into
story
which
began:
Mrs
Toogood
whose
daughter
Alice
was
Little
Beauty
but
rather
Coquette
despaired
of
ever
seeing
Golden/Ring
on
the
Lady's
Finger...)
We
need
not
cavil
of
course
at
the
absence
of
such
obvious
reference
sources;
in
work
like
this
the
author
has
the
right
to
favour
serendipity
over
methodical
research
Whether
he
has
the
right
to
be
needlessly
careless
in
his
statements
is
perhaps
another
matter
As
typical
example
we
read
that
the
word
derrick
derived
from
the
surname
of
famous
hangman
was
in
use
for
centuries
as
name
for
the
gallows
glance
at
the
citations
in
the
OED
or
at
Partridge's
article
in
Name
Into
Word
which
Dickson
cites
in
his
bibliography
would
have
made
it
clear
that
this
usage
did
not
extend
beyond
the
17th
century
It
is
also
news
to
me
that
once
wrote
book
called
First
Names
mentioned
on
page
138
Mr
Dickson's
definition
of
name
is
itself
rather
unsatisfactory
Why
are
we
suddenly
treated
on
page
16
to
an
incomplete
list
of
-ine
words

What
are
the
German
nouns
Wettfahrt
and
Fahrtwind
(printed

doing

The
latter
may
interest
those
who
make
special
study
of
flatulence
(perdologists?)
if
such
people
exist
but
these
are
not
names
There
is
no
need
to
include
non-names
in
book
of
this
kind
when
we
are
surrounded
by
thousands
of
minor
nomenclatures
The
paper
on
which
these
words
are
printed
for
instance
as
well
as
the
typeface
and
even
the
ink
have
names
Almost
any
generic
noun
can
be
broken
down
into
named
subdivisions
To
knowledgeable
pogonologist
beard
is
Bodkin
Cathedral
Ducktail
Goatee
Lavatory
Brush
Imperial
Pique-devant
Spade
Stiletto
or
Vandyke
to
name
but
few
At
least
two
hundred
types
of
hat
have
more
specific
names
If
Mr
Dickson
wished
to
remain
thoroughly
American
he
could
still
find
interesting
names
on
his
doorstep
Let
me
recommend

Jonathon
Green
has
deservedly
acquired
the
mantle
of
Eric
Partridge
as
the
foremost
authority
on
British
slang
His
books
are

listed
on
the

of
this

The
present
work
is
departure
for
him
for
most
of
his
earlier
works
have
been
reference
books
have
heard
some
of
Green's
broadcasts
and
interviews
and
he
comes
off
quite
well
for
he
is
smooth
and
glib
just
what
is
needed
for
radio
That
style
translated
into
book
form
however
makes
this
book
seem
greatly
overwritten
Its
main
fault
lies
in
the
reliance
on
extensive
quotations
from
the
works
described
the
sort
of
thing
one
expects
to
be
paraphrased
by
historian
with
the
original
matter
buried
in
footnotes
Mercifully
there
are
few
such
notes
and
they
come
at
the
end
of
the
book
where
they
can
be
ignored
The
problem
with
the
quotations
is
that
they
are
often
quite
long
and
neither
interesting
nor
revealing
often
serving
to
support
point
made
by
the
author
whom
would
be
happy
to
believe
on
his
own
recognizance
Still
there
are
number
of
errors
which
ought
to
be
corrected
for
any
subsequent
edition
or
printing
Green's
account

personal
lives
(and
qualificationsâor
lack
thereof)
of
the
famous
lexicographers
One
might
quarrel
with
an
occasional
comment
(like
[The
Techne
might
be
said
to
have
become
the
basis
of
every
Greek
textbook
that
schoolboys
in
England
and
elsewhere
would
face
until
the
year
1000
which
must
have
encompassed
relatively
small
number)
but
such
are
few
and
far
between
in
the
earlier
chapters
of
the
book
It
is
not
till
we
arrive
at
the
final
chapter
The
Modern
World
that
serious
inadequacies
rear
their
ugly
heads
Green
writes:
[Lexicographers]
have
retained
their
priestly
role
especially
in
America
and
especially
in
the
world
of
what
America
terms
college
and
Britain
concise
dictionaries,..
[p
359]
The
simple
facts
are
that
American
college
(or
desk)
dictionaries
today
contain
about
170,000
entries
(about
half
that
number
of
headwords)
up
from
the
Â±130,000
they
had
till
the
1960s);
British
concise
dictionaries
contain
far
fewer
than
that:
the
Concise
Oxford
the
best-selling
dictionary
in
the
UK
contains
about
120,000
entries
(probably
not
more
than
about
60,000
headwords)
which
is
equivalent
to
what
are
classed
as
concise
dictionaries
in
America
As
far
as
am
aware
what
are
called
college
or
desk
dictionaries
in
America
have
no
special
label
in
Britain
though
several
notably
the
Collins
Dictionary
are
of
comparable
extent
Green
is
correct
in
writing
that
the
(unabridged
Funk
Wagnalls)
Standard
Dictionary
of
the
English
Language
(1893)
gives
two
pronunciations
for
each
entry
but
he
is
mistaken
in
reporting
that
one
represents
the
popular
pronunciation
the
other
showing
the
precise
one
[p.364]:
there
are
two
pronunciations
because
one
employs
more
popular
presumably
understandable
pronunciation
key
(called
in
the
phonetics
trade
broad
transcription)
while
the
other
cleaves
to
scholarly
transcription
(called
narrow
transcription);
if
such
pattern
were
followed
today
the
first
would
be
the
simplified
system
used
generally
in
most
dictionaries
and
the
second
would
employ
the
symbols
of
the
International
Phonetic
Alphabet
(which
for
their
more
recondite
transcriptions
require
trained
phonetician
for
their
understanding)
In
discussing
the
third
edition
of
Merriam-Webster's
New
International
Dictionary
(MW-III)
Green
describes
one
of
its
main
advances
as
general
move
away
from
America's
traditional
prescriptive
lexicography
towards
more
descriptive
British
style
Such
move
had
indeed
taken
place
many
years
before
Philip
Gove's
editorship
of
the
MW-III
and
is
evidenced
in
such
works
as
the
Merriam-Webster
Collegiate
Webster's
New
World
and
American
College
dictionaries

Let
us
now
turn
to
the

body
of

Opening
it

Hogwash
Sailor's

rubbish
tale
with
no
truth
in
it;
and
worthless
stuff:
His
claim
that

is
all
hogwash
Aside
from
the
unfortunate
quotation
which
hardly
seems
nautical
at
all
hogwash
is
ordinary
English
which
it
may
be
assumed
(English-speaking)
sailors
used
as
medium
in
which
to
couch
their
nauticalisms
Thus
the
direction
would
seem
to
have
been
from
everyday
word
to
language
of
the
sea
and
not
as
advertised
vice
versa
The
same
must
be
said
for

hold

scores
of

these
were
everyday
words
in
the
general
language
before
they
were
used
by
sailors
The
problemâand
it
is
serious
oneâ
is
that
there
are
indeed
many
words
and
phrases
that
originated
at
sea
and
were
brought
ashore
for
ready
embodiment
in
everyday
speech
but
to
find
the
same
terms
in
both
does
not
justify
the
assertion
that
the
sea
term
came
first
It
must
be
saidâand
believe
shall
be
borne
out
on
thisâthat
relying
on
citations
appearing
in
the
OED
or
in
works
written
long
ago
is
precarious
business:
the
only
accurate
safe
statement
that
can
be
made
about
such
information
is
that
it
provides
evidence
for
the
existence
of
word
in
given
context
at
the
time
of
publication
of
the
work:
it
cannot
and
must
not
be
construed
as
the
first
time
the
word
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
earth
merely
as
the
first
written
evidence
we
have
of
its
appearance
Clearly
that
is
not
to
say
that
most
words
appearing
in
quotations
in
the
OED
and
in
any
other
(original)
source
are
being
used
for
the
first
time:
on
the
contrary
it
is
very
likelyâand
this
might
well
apply
to
terms
of
art
of
specialized
field
and
particularly
the
speech
of
sailors
who
did
not
enjoy
an
entirely
savory
reputationâthat
the
terms
were
in
oral
use
for
long
time
before
they
were
written
down
Consider
how
long
it
took

to

true
when
dealing
with
languageâor
even
accurate
as
the
alchemists
and
other
early
researchers
in
science
discovered
There
is
certain
charm
seen
in
working
the
alchemy
of
language
and
we
can
well
appreciate
it
in
the
context
of
artistic
license
But
it
is
quite
another
thing
when
it
is
foisted
on
an
unsuspecting
public
as
fact
when
indeed
it
is
either
pure
speculation
or
writer's
interpretation
of
the
best
way
to
make
data
fit
into
the
procrustean
bed
of
his
theory
There
is
no
doubt
that
much
controversy
has
surrounded
the
interpretation
of
the
word
devil
in
nautical
contexts
and
particularly
with
the
expression
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea
Likewise
it
is
indisputable
that
many
nautical
expressions
have
come
ashore
to
be
used
metaphorically
by
landlubbers
The
problem
is
that
although
many
such
expressions
have
been
included
in
Ship
to
Shore
many
that
were
not
nautical
have
also
been
listed
As
it
is
impossible
for
the
non-expert
to
sort
them
out
it
remains
for
people
like
Jeans
to
do
so
and
he
has
incautiously
included
many
for
which
insufficient
evidence
exists
that
they
were
originally
nautical
and
he
has
failed
in
his
duty
by
not
identifying
questionable
entries
Shardlow's
drawings
are

Nineteenth-Century
English
It
is
always
good
idea
to
read
an
author's
preface
(or
foreword)
to
discover
the
purpose
of
book
before
reading
and
certainly
before
reviewing
it
From
Professor
Bailey's
we
quote
the
following
which
pretty
much
sums
up
his
attitude
toward
language
in
general
and
English
in
particular:
English
is
single
language
full
of
variety
and
believe
that
no
speaker
is
beneath
notice
and
no
single
one
has
exclusive
rights
to
represent
the
language
Models
assuming
metropolis
and
hinterland
capital
and
colony
standard
language
and
dialect
have
little
to
offer
except
fragmentation
and
prejudice
It
is
virtually
impossible
to
argue
against
such
point
of
departure
from
the
standpoint
of
the
linguistic
scientific
investigator
After
all
researchers
into
cancer
heart
disease
virology
and
bacteriology
would
look
quite
foolish
were
they
to
adopt
the
high
moral
ground
by
damning
the
causes
of
disease
as
sinful
or
bad
Yet
the
issue
of
good
vs
bad
is
always
at
the
forefront
when
language
comes
up
for
discussion
not
perhaps
among
linguists
but
to
be
sure
among
the
rest
of
the
population
In
some
cases
murder
mayhem
and
to
borrow
tasteless
euphemism
from
social
conflict
linguistic
cleansing
have
been
aroused
by
languageânot
by
vituperation
cursing
and
blasphemy
but
simply
by
being
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
speaking
particular
language
or
dialect
Dialect
differences
can
cause
strife
and
disharmony
as
can
be
witnessed
in
the
contemporary
dispute
over
the
decision
by
California
school
district
to
use
Ebonics
as
vehicle
to
teach
Standard
English
Linguists
might
well
distance
themselves
from
such
mundane
anti-intellectualism
but
that
does
not
make
it
go
away
nor
does
it
solve
the
problem
or
come
close
to
answering
the
question
of
what
should
be
done
about
teaching
language
very
telling
point
in
such
disputes
is
that
those
who
speak
dialect
other
than
Standard
(which
we
persist
in
putting
in
quotation
marks
because
it
continually
changes
both
temporally
and
geographically)
are
condemned
to
accept
work
that
is
below
level
socially
and
economically
to
which
they
aspire
and
to
which
they
feel
they
are
entitled
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
opportunity
As
have
held
while
language
itself
can
the
subject
of
cool
analysis
in
some
contexts
it
is
social
institution
and
our
means
of
communication
While
it
is
not
only
scientific
and
scholarly
but
noble
to
maintain
that
such
matters
as
pronunciation
usage
dialect
and
other
features
are
all
part
of
the
description
of
language
and
are
neither
good
nor
bad
the
fact
remains
that
using
dialect
or
speech
pattern
that
is
unacceptable
to
those
who
are
giving
out
the
jobs
may
mean
that
one
either
gets
the
job
or
not
other
qualifications
being
equal
hence
the
scientific
and
scholarly
considerations
may
be
effectively
put
into
their
academic
niches
where
they
belong
There
is
another
aspect
to
the
entire
subject
invariably
ignored
by
linguists
and
linguistic
scientists
because
they
remain
unable
to
measure
or
quantify
it
namely
style
Language
is
language
says
the
scientist
totally
ignoring
(sometimes
deliberately
usually
owing
to
lack
of
discernment)
any
artâor
lack
thereofâthat
might
be
involved
in
the
speech
or
writing
of
individuals
whether
professional
writers
or
not
(Some
might
protest
that
the
study
called
stylistics
deals
with
art
in
language
but
those
who
know
the
nature
of
stylistics
are
aware
that
it
does
not
even
come
close
to
measuring
effectiveness
poetry
eloquence
beauty
and
other
characteristics
associated
with
artistic
expression.)
Third
the
language
of
an
individual
reflects
his
culture
which
is
catch-all
term
covering
many
things
There
are
those
of
an
older
generation
that
considers
itself
better
educated
than
almost
anyone
younger
who
understand
culture
to
mean
familiarity
with
the
better
and
more
important
works
of
art
(of
all
kinds)
of
the
world
This
interpretation
of
culture
is
admittedly
of
decreasing
importance
to
an
increasing
proportion
of
the
population
who
place
rock
'n'
roll
stars
on
the
same
scale
of
artistic
accomplishment
as
Milton
Rembrandt
Mozart
Gershwin
Hemingway
et
al.;
because
the
last
do
not
speak
to
them
they
are
peremptorily
shouldered
out
of
consideration
This
aspect
of
language
should
not
be
construed
solely
as
demonstration
of
knowledge
(as
in
knowing
how
many
symphonies
Beethoven
wrote
whether
Caruso
was
tenor
or
bass
or
being
able
to
hum
melodies
from
Puccini's
operas)
though
that
is
certainly
reflex
of
cultured
individual
Rather
it
is
the
artistry
that
rubs
off
on
the
person
steeped
in
the
best
parts
of
the
culture
the
phrase
unconsciously
plucked
from
17th-century
poem
or
16th-century
play
(no
matter
how
corny
like
Methinks
the
lady
doth
protest
too
much)
the
single
word
that
indicates
at
least
passing
familiarity
with
history
(like
defenestration
)
the
fragment
of
an
air
associated
with
Bach
fugue
These
aspects
of
language
are
social
philosophical
artistic
largely
ignored
by
linguists
sometimes
out
of
devotion
to
what
is
perceived
as
the
scientific
method
sometimes
out
of
sheer
philistinism
and
the
inability
to
exercise
taste
sometimes
out
of
abject
ignorance
One
need
only
read
the
academic
papers
published
in
linguistic
journals
to
be
convinced
that
notwithstanding
their
specialty
linguists
at
large
are
incapable
of
writing
simple
expository
declarative
sentences
without
resorting
to
turgid
syntax
obscure
vocabulary
and
uncompromising
sesquipedalianism
In
short
considering
that
their
specialty
is
language
it
is
astonishing
how
few
of
them
use
it
effectively
In
this
regard
am
pleased
to
say
that
Richard
Bailey
is
an
exception
Though
linguistâand
good
oneâhe
knows
how
to
write
and
how
to
write
persuasively
and
informatively
Most
of
the
preceding
commentary
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
substance
of
Nineteenth-Century
English
which
traces
the
spread
growth
and
increasing
universality
of
the
English
language
during
that
period
Bailey
examines
the
Writing
Sounds
Words
Slang
Grammar
and
Voices
of
English
to
quote
the
chapter
headings
and
he
does
so
without
expressing
much
opinion
about
them
letting
the
facts
speak
for
themselves
Well
almost
Bailey's
presentation
is
tinged
by
an
underlying
suggestion
of
disapproval
of
those
who
would
dictate
the
way
the
language
should
be
used
He
does
not
say
as
much
expressly
but
his
characterization
of
such
do-gooders
as
pedants
(p
215)
and
purists
(p
223)
his
persistent
placing
of
quotation
marks
around
words
and
phrases
condemned
by
contemporary
purists
and
pedants
to
signifyâwhat?â
their
quaintness?
their
curiosity?
For
the
most
part
despite
the
occasional
campaigning
for
linguistic
liberalism
(aimed
obviously
at
20th-
and
presumably
21st-century
readers)
what
emerges
is
an
engaging
picture
of
concerned
speakers
of
English
some
of
them
pedants
trying
to
establish
(or
preserve)
some
purity
in
the
language
the
remainder
readers
of
the
works
published
by
the
former
in
the
shape
of
grammars
usage
guides
pronunciation
guides
spellers
etc
Because
English
spelling
is
often
unrelated
to
its
pronunciation
and
inconsistent
with
it
the
majority
of
spellers
were
used
as
teaching
tools
in
schools;
but
there
was
also
an
opportunity
to
acquaint
adults
with
accepted
spelling
forms
(just
as
there
is
today
among
the
bad
speller's
dictionaries)
There
is
no
gainsaying
that
standardization
of
spelling
(and
of
other
mechanics
of
language)
can
be
helpful
to
communication
but
like
other
reflexes
of
language
proficiency
it
can
also
mark
the
relative
literacy
or
education
of
person
Spelling
and
conventional
hyphenation
can
be
linked;
while
noted
not
so
much
as
single
typographical
error
in
this
book
saw
once
again
confirmation
of
the
encroaching
ignorance
of
those
who
write
automatic
hyphenation
programs
for
computers
presumably
employed
in
the
production
of
the
work:
the
oft-repeated
word
English
properly
hyphenated
Eng-lish
has
been
made
to
conform
to
the
other
words
having
-ng-
at
syllable
break
by
appearing
as
Eng-lish
throughout
This
rule
is
well
known
to
traditional
compositors
though
curiously
it
does
not
extend
to
Angle
or
Anglo
(as
in
Anglo-Saxon
though
they
are
all
linked
etymologically
The
same
point
was
raised
in
our
review
[XIX
1
15]
of
Bailey's
Images
of
English
(1991
also
University
of
Michigan
Press)
In
his
assessment
of
the
century
as
whole
Bailey
discusses
the
progress
of
education
especially
public
education
and
the
spread
of
literacy
In
that
regard
point
to
be
made
about
the
culture
of
the
period
in
contrast
to
the
language
is
the
publication
late
in
the
century
of
number
of
reference
books
especially
readers'
handbooks
and
particularly
Dictionary
of
Phrase
and
Fable
by
E
Cobham
Brewer
which
went
through
many
printings
and
revived
in
the
latter
part
of
the
20th
century
through
several
updated
editions
It
is
significant
because
its
enormous
popularity
reflects
the
public's
interest
in
metaphor
based
on
classical
and
cultural
references
understandable
only
to
those
steeped
in
the
literature
not
to
those
who
having
learned
to
read
seldom
read
anything
but
dime
novel
popular
magazines
or
newspaper
Those
who
aspired
to
broader
knowledge
used
Brewer's
and
others'
books
as
ready-reference
guide
to
culture
It
is
not
insignificant
that
their
popularity
has
seen
reflowering
hundred
years
after
their
original
appearance
late
in
the
19th
century
Nineteenth-Century
English
is
an
interesting
if
somewhat
staid
tracing
of
the
development
of
English
into
world
language
though
its
influence
today
is
probably
owing
directly
more
to
events
of
the
past
sixty
years
than
to
the
growth
and
spread
it
enjoyed
during
the
century
of
colonialism
Still
there
is
no
gainsaying
Bailey's
ultimate
argument:
Nineteenth-century
English
was
part
of
social
transformation
that
changed
the
language
and
changed
the
world
It
remains
to
be
seen
what
will
be
written
about
the
20th
century
the
close
of
which
is
seeing
spread
of
English
via
the
Internet
that
is
regarded
as
so
pernicious
by
the
French
that
they
have
seen
fit
to
prosecute
company
(with
pied
terre
in
France)
for
advertising
on
the
medium
in
English
without
the
accompaniment
of
French
translation
Will
the
21st
century
see
still
more
diversification
of
English
and
encouragement
of
that
diversity
or
more
standardization
and
conformity
to
the
medium
employed
by
major
industrial
powers?
There
is
little
doubt
that
people
who
are
driven
by
economic
necessity
will
cleave
to
the
language
most
closely
associated
with
financial
reward
and
the
opportunities
offered
by
the
Internet
are
immense
compared
with
those
formerly
offered
by
books
motion
pictures
television
and
other
media
Still
it
is
impossible
to
predict
accurately
what
the
future
will
bring
and
hundred
years
hence
everyone
might
well
be
lisping

[Note:
The
publisher
originally
sent
only
the
cassette
and
that
is
what
is
reviewed
here.]
This
hour-long
tape
recording
employing
the
casual
format
of
the
candid
microphone
offers
thirteen
diverse
English
speech
patterns
gleaned
from
as
many
off
the
cuff
interviews
Because
no
other
information
accompanied
the
tape
this
reviewer
was
forced
to
depend
on
the
more
than
slightly
helter-skelter
impression
it
leaves
on
the
chartless
listener
The
quality
of
the
tape
itself
is
often
fuzzy
(no
matter
that
the
interviews
appear
to
be
unrehearsed)
The
table
of
contents
on
the
sleeve
omits
the
Dublin
segment
even
though
the
speaker
is
very
much
there
in
his
recollections
of
the
1916
uprising
Lloyd
George
the
Black
and
Tan
as
well
as
bits
and
pieces
of
his
own
life's
history
The
interviews
are
preceded
by
set
of
drill-words
presumably
to
establish
the
regional
pronunciation
of
English
vowel
sounds
which
have
over
the
centuries
undergone
many
striking
changes
Not
altogether
surprisingly
the
drill-words
are
almost
without
exception
spoken
with
great
clarity
from
Bristol
to
Northumberland
and
Liverpool
to
Lowland
Scots
But
once
the
polite
obligation
to
enunciate
these
sounds
is
got
over
the
narrators
are
back
on
familiar
ground
most
of
them
buoyantly
loquacious
and
quite
at
home
with
the
art
of
the
monologue
Their
stories
range
from
mirthful
account
by
Bristol
woman
about
her
shiftless
next-door
neighbor
whose
overflowing
drain
gutters
flooded
her
property
to
somber
story
by
man
from
South
Wales
whose
son's
leg
was
amputated
in
fearful
childhood
accident
There
is
no
high
drama
in
these
everyday
stories:
they
are
simply
abstract
and
brief
chronicles
of
time
and
place
spoken
artifacts
for
preserving
the
everfluctuating
accents
and
dialects
of
Great
Britain's
intricate
linguistic
hierarchy
It
should
be
noted
however
that
these
singular
odds
and
ends
of
regional
accents
are
far
from
being
useful
for
an
actor
aspiring
to
become
the
next
Meryl
Streep
mistress
of
the
(virtual)
dialect
Although
they
are
indisputably
accurate
none
of
the
excerpts
is
sufficiently
heightened
to
be
model
for
simulation
especially
given
the
unfocused
quality
of
the
tape
itself
In
his
1912
preface
to
Pygmalion
George
Bernard
Shaw
wrote
It
is
impossible
for
an
Englishman
to
open
his
mouth
without
making
another
Englishman
hate
or
despise
him
And
in
1989
John
Honey
an
English
professor
and
phonetics
expert
wrote
Does
Accent
Matter?
[rev
XVI,1,10]
in
which
he
champions
the
cause
of
teaching
the
Queen's
English
(RP
or
received
pronunciation)
in
order
to
achieve
social
and
economic
equality
for
those
who
are
passed
over
in
the
job
market
because
of
unacceptable
regional
accents
such
as
the
nasal
twangs
and
glottal
stops
of
Cockey
Liverpudlian
and
Glaswegian
Both
Pygmalion
arguments
are
sound
as
well
as
altruistic;
but
at
time
when
certain
civilizations
and
cultures
are
in
danger
of
losing
their
spoken
heritage
these
slight
quirky
renderings
of
native
speech
may
prove
to
be
as
valuable
as
the
archaeologist's
fossil
finds
Only

of

which
almost
died
out
over
the
past
fifty
years
An
Ainu
farmer
speaks
for
the
strange
tenacious
hold
of
one's

tongue:
It's
true
the

is
almost
lost
but
there's
lot
of
spirit
still
so
don't
think
it's
too
late
And
that
appears
to
be
the
underlying
purpose
of
English
Accents
and
Dialects
fitting
epigraph
to
which
might
be
added

When

unblushingly
commit
blunders
such
as
these
is
it
any
wonder
that

slanging

the
bitter
exchange
of
empty
slogans?
Words

loss
But
here
it
is
not
the
words
that

and
their
failure
is
both
symptom
and

confusion
Sad

it
provide
proof
that
death
is
no
longer
taboo
or
are
such
euphemisms
the
victims
of
modern
contempt
for
flowery
imprecise
language?
For
whatever
reason
phrases
such
as

sound
decidedly
old-fashioned
these

death
of

is
seen
as
return
to
chaos
and
disorder

is

announced
directly

to
announce

is

the

to

the
many

On

distinguished
by
its
being
ill-considered:
flame
is
usually
insulting
or
provocative
(in
the
sense
of
causing
irritation);
it
can
also
be
simply
persisting
incessantly
and
rabidly
on
topic
others
find
uninteresting
(or
past
the
point
of
interest)
Flames
are
not
any
more
ill-considered
than
all
the
rest
of
human
communication
unless
you
are
of
particularly
pacifist
philosophy
that
deems
all
acrimony
ill
considered
If
the
reader
doesn't
know
what
flag
is
defining
it
as
piece
of
information
that
is
either
true
or
false
is
worse
than
not
defining
it
at
all
You
can
think
of
flag
as
marker
associated
with
something
else:
the
flag
can
be
one
or
zero
on
or
off
yes
or
no
One
use
of
flag
is
to
mark
whether
information
currently
in
use
in
computer
application
has
been
changed
since
it
was
last
saved
If
yes
the
user
is
asked
whether
it
should
be
saved
upon
exit;
if
no
the
program
simply
exits
flag
is
true
or
false
only
in
the
very
limited
sense
of
asking
the
question
Is
it
true
that
the
information
on
the
screen
is
different
from
its
counterpart
on
the
disk?
It
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
correctness
of
the
information
and
the
flag
itself
is
presumably
always
true
Almost
as
misleading
is
the
idea
that
real
time
is
an
amount
of
time
such
as
the
time
it
takes
real
people
to
communicate
on
telephone:
real
time
as
applied
to
computer
system
is
actually
respected
technical
term
that
describes
using
computer
for
something
that
is
happening
while
the
program
is
running
like
the
computer's
modification
of
the
angles
of
the
flaps
of
an
airplane
in
flight
based
on
the
rate
of
change
of
the
altimeter
independent
of
commands
from
the
pilot
This
term
distinguishes
such
programs
from
the
more
common
type
for
example
calculating
flight
path
based
on
weather
predictions
for
use
later
in
the
day
Real
time
in
jargon
applies
to
doing
something
without
time
for
planning
or
previous
thought
as
in
the
minutes
before
presentation
(or
indeed
during
it)
creating
display
to
replace
the
key
prop
someone
forgot
Other
terms
define
duration
of
time
in
the
real
world
as
opposed
to
the
amount
of
computer
processing
time
required
for
something
One
such
term
is

she
only

thus
committed
number
of
deplorable

Ms
Flanders
lists
bÃ¶
hmische
DÃ¶rfer
and
Wortsalat
as
synonyms
These
two
words
are
however
far
from
interchangeable
Wortsalat
means
obscure
phraseology
and
mysterious
wording
often
referring
to
page-length
sentences
that
can
crop
up
in
the
writing
of
bureaucrats
and
politicians
The
phrase
jemandem

jemanden
bÃ¶hmische
DÃ¶rfer
ein
bÃ¶hmisches
Dorf
sein
could
be
translated
as
to
appear
incomprehensible
inexplicable
or
strange
Originally
the
phrase
expressed
the
fact
that
to
Germans
living
in
Bohemia
the
Slav
village
names
sounded
strange
and
that
the
Germans
could
not
understand
them
precisely
Also
Germans
would
never
say
or
write
Senf

they
had
in
mind
the
meaning
to
meddle
in

people's
affairs
conversation
by
adding
one's

In
this

it
is

the

it
would
be

The
phrase

wie

That
goes
like

is
interesting
from
semantic
viewpoint
The
comparison
signified
that

not
go
together
at
all
because
if

of

Wilenitz's
comment
in
his
EPISTOLA
[XXIII,1,24]
about
my
EPISTOLA
[XXII,2,10]
in
response
to
Milton
Horowitz's
Discouraging
Word
[OBITER
DICTA
XXII,1,13]
The
subject
of
our
epistolary
dialogue
is
the
etymology
of
the
word
balagan
buzzword
in
modern
Hebrew
If
in
Mr
Wilenitz's
EPISTOLA
he
had
written
Perhaps
[instead
of
Surely
the
vehicle
for
carrying
the
Russian
word
into
modern
Israeli
Hebrew
was
Yiddish
would
agree
with
him
without
reservation
But
recent
experiences
in
San
Francisco
as
well
as
casual
earlier
observations
in
the
New
York
area
and
in
Israel
suggest
to
me
that
Russian
is
to
the
current
Ashkenazic
Diaspora
what
Yiddish
was
to
earlier
Jewish
communities
in
Europe
and
America
The
analogy
is
not
perfect;
analogies
hardly
ever
are
Unless
Yiddish
is
merely
dialect
of
German
and
not
separate
language
spoken
almost
exclusively
by
Jews
it
differs
from
the
Russian
spoken
by
the
bulk
of
Jewish
emigrants
from
the
USSR
in
being
the
Jews'
own
language
rather
than
shared
language
like
Russian
In
the
following
anecdote
substitution
of
the
word
Russian
for
Yiddish
kills
the
joke
though
am
sure
that
many
more
Jews
today
speak
Russian
than
speak
Yiddish
An
old
Jewish
lady
in
Israel
was
chided
by
her
children
for
talking
to
their
Sabra
children

dialect
of
the
ghetto
instead
of
in
Hebrew
But
the
old
grandmother
protested
talk
to
them
in
Yiddish
because
want
them
to
know
they're
Jewish
Nevertheless
Jewish
immigrants
to
America
and
even
in
Israel
despite
pressure
to
learn
Hebrew
communicate
among
themselves
mainly
in
Russian
hardly
ever
in
Yiddish

Jews

as

found
myself
chatting
with
one
of
the
nurses
in

While
waiting
for
my
wife
in
the
reception
room
saw
dapper
little
old
fellow
approach
the
information
desk
and
attempt
in
Russian
to
get
directions
from
the
uncomprehending
woman
in
attendance
there
behind
sign
in
several
languages
including
Tagalogâbut
not
Yiddish
interpreted
for
the
old
gentleman
and
then
having
nothing
better
to
do
walked
with
him
to
the
building
he
had
been
directed
to
He
was
from
Kiev
was
once
at
Jewish
friend's
birthday
party
where
somehow
the
guests
mostly
Jewish
got
to
talking
about
their
grandparents
most
of
whom
came
from
Kiev
and
thereabouts
One
of
the
guests
laughing
hyperbolically
remarked
Well
everyone's
grandmother
came
from
Kiev
(Of
course
politically
the
Ukraine
or
Ukraine
tout
court
as
it

now
officially
called
is
no
longer
Russian
but
as
for
language
it
is
at
least
as
Russian
as
it
is
Ukrainian.)
So
guessed
that
the
old
gentleman
was
Jewish
and
would
bet
that
he
was
fluent
only
in
Russian
If
indeed
Russian
is
the
principal
language
of
the
current
Jewish
Diaspora
balagan
at
least
in
Milton
Horowitz's
example
where
it
applied
to
computer
screen
might
have
come
directly
from
Russian
into
Hebrew
without
the
intermediary
of
Yiddish
Or
perhaps
it
was
simply
Russian
in
English
transliteration
rather
than
the
Hebrew
or
Yiddish
word
borrowed
from
Russian

They
adopted

as
their
capital
from
531
until
554
when
they
moved
it
to
Toledo
The
invasion
of
the
Moors
in
711
brought
the
Visigothic
kingdom
to
an
end
and
Catalonia
was

overrun
by

After

While
much
of
Spain
was
under

domination
Barcelona
and
most
of
Catalonia
remained
linked
to
northern
Europe
geo-political
wrinkle
that
would
do
much
to
determine
the
distinct
Catalonian
character
Cataloniaâs
legendary
founding

also
gave
the
budding
nation
its
flag
of
four
horizontal
red
stripes
on

the

holds
that

date
celebrated

as

The
Catalan
nation
was
soon
enlarged
through
marriage
and
military
adventure
RamÃ³n
Berenguer
III
(1096â1131)
captured
Mallorca
Ibiza
and
Tarragona
from
the
Moors
and
acquired
the
French
county
of
Provence
through
his
heiress
wife
His
successor
RamÃ³n
Berenguer
IV
united
Catalonia
with
neighboring
AragÃ³n
by
marriage
and
his
son
Alfonso
II
became
the
first
joint-king
of
AragÃ³n
and
Catalonia
and
was
known
as
âthe
Emperor
of
the
Pyrenees.â
His
kingdom
extended
all
the
way
to
Nice
But
much
of
this
territory
was
lost
by
the
next
king
Alfonsoâs
son
Peter
the
Catholic
who
picked
the
losing
side
in
the
French
crusade
against
the
heretics
of
Albi
Successive
generations
turned
their
attention
towards
the
conquest
of
the
Mediterranean
basin
Jaume
(1213â1276)
known
as
âthe
Conqueror,â
consolidated
control
over
the
Balearic
Islands
and
claimed
Valencia
Pedro
III
(1276â
1285)
annexed
Sicily
in
1282
Over
the
ensuing
century
Barcelona
reached
the
peak
of
its
glory:
Its
mercantilist
trade
grew
rapidly
throughout
the
Mediterranean
and
its
territories
included
Sardinia
Corsica
Naples
the
Roussillon
in
southern
France
and
briefly
Athens
The
Middle
Ages
from
the
late-13thâ15th
centuries
were
time
of
great
building
in
Barcelona
giving
rise
to
the
cathedral
and
other
great
Gothic
palaces
and
monuments
Wedged
between
Europe
and
the
Muslim
territories
Barcelona
served
as
channel
for
the
exchange
of
scientific
knowledge
and
scholarship
The
arts
flourished
in
the
cities
and
monasteries
of
Catalonia
patronized
by
vigorous
class
of
artisans
bankers
and
merchants
including
an
important
Jewish
community
Nascent
democratic
institutions
appeared
with
code
of
laws
the
Usatges
de
Barcelona
in
the
11th
century;
municipal
council
with
participation
of
leading
citizens
called
the
Consell
de
Cent
(Council
of
One
Hundred)
was
formed
in
1249;
and
in
1283
parliament
or
Corts
for
Catalonia
originated
later
to
become
the
Generalitat
the
civil
government
Barcelonaâs
fate
took
another
decisive
turn
when
the
marriage
of
Ferdinand
of
AragÃ³n-Catalonia
(FerrÃ¡n
II
to
the
Catalans)
to
Isabella
of
Castile
joined
their
two
crowns
and
formed
the
nucleus
of
united
Spanish
state
Under
Los
Reyes
CatÃ³licosÂ âÂ called
âThe
Catholic
Monarchsâ
because
they
finally
captured
the
last
Moorish
redoubt
on
the
Peninsula
at
Granada
in
1492Â âÂ Catalonia
was
fully
incorporated
into
the
Castilian
state
After
Christopher
Columbus
discovered
America
he
was
received
by
the
monarchs
in
Barcelonaâs
Royal
Palace
Despite
the
symbolic
gesture
Castile
the
power
center
of
Spain
exclusively
exploited
New
World
riches
excluding
Barcelona
for
300
years
The
Catholic
churchâs
hard-line
Inquisition
expelled
Jews
from
Spain;
communities
in
Barcelona
and
Girona
were
particularly
affected
During
the
16th
century
Golden
Age
for
Spain
the
political
influence
of
Catalonia
and
Barcelona
declined
even
further
The
Dutch-speaking
Hapsburg
grandson
of
Ferdinand
and
Isabella
was
anointed
Charles
of
Spain
in
1516
He
inherited
the
title
of
Holy
Roman
Emperor
and
became
Charles
V
with
duties
throughout
Europe
that
gave
him
little
time
for
Spain
His
son
Philip
II
moved
the
capital
of
the
great
Spanish
empire
from
Toledo
to
previously
insignificant
Madrid
In
1640
with
Spain
and
France
at
war
Catalonia
declared
itself
an
independent
republic
allied
to
Philip
IVâs
enemy
France
After
the
French
defeat
in
1652
the
Catalan
territories
north
of
the
Pyrenees
were
delivered
to
France
fixing
the
border
where
it
is
today
The
ensuing
years
were
rife
with
constant
wars
shifting
alliances
and
disputes
over
succession
to
the
crown
In
all
of
these
conflicts
Barcelona
automatically
sided
with
whomever
opposed
Madrid
and
usually
ended
up
the
loser
The
worst
of
these
episodes
came
in
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
(1701â1713)
between
the
backers
of
Philip
of
Anjou
the
17-year-old
grandson
of
Louis
XIV
of
France
and
the
Hapsburg
claimant
Archduke
Charles
of
Austria
Charles
was
enthusiastically
received
when
he
landed
in
Catalonia
but
Philip
supported
by
France
won
the
war
and
became
the
first
Bourbon
ruler
as
Philip
V
After
13-month
siege
on
11
September
1714
the
royal
army
captured
and
sacked
Barcelona
The
Catalan
Generalitat
was
dissolved
and
the
cityâs
privileges
were
abolished
The
Ciutadella
fortress
was
built
to
keep
the
populace
subdued
and
official
use
of
the
Catalan
language
was
outlawed
Catalonia
celebrates
this
defeat
as
its
national
holiday
symbol
of
the
spirit
of
nationalist
resistance
Discord
within
the
Spanish
government
or
conflict
with
foreign
powers
frequently
served
as
an
excuse
for
Catalan
separatists
to
rise
up
though
their
rebellions
were
usually
summarily
quashed
From
1808
to
1814
Spain
again
became
battleground
with
British
forces
taking
on
Napoleonâs
troops
in
the
Peninsular
War
Napoleon
attacked
and
destroyed
Cataloniaâs
sacred
shrine
the
monastery
at
Montserrat
The
spirit
of
liberalism
prevalent
in
Europe
was
tardy
in
reaching
Spain
After
many
reverses
democratic
constitution
was
finally
proclaimed
and
constitutional
monarchy
was
instituted
in
1874
Four
years
later
Barcelona
was
at
long
last
given
the
right
to
trade
with
the
colonies
of
the
New
World
Meanwhile
the
city
had
gone
about
its
business
devoting
its
energies
to
industrialization
Barcelonaâs
medieval
walls
were
torn
down
to
make
way
for
an
expansion
in
the
mid-19th
century
The
Eixample
an
elegant
modern
district
was
laid
out
on
grid
of
broad
avenues
where
the
new
industrialists
built
mansions
Wealthy
patrons
supported
forward-looking
architects
including
Antoni
GaudÃ­
and
LluÃ­s
DomÃ¨nech
Muntaner
who
embraced
modernisme
Prosperity
was
accompanied
by
revival
in
Catalan
arts
and
letters
period
known
in
Catalan
as
the
RenaixenÃ§a
(Renaissance)
In
burst
of
optimism
the
city
bid
for
worldwide
recognition
with
the
Universal
Exposition
of
1888
built
on
the
site
of
the
hated
Ciutadella
fortress
With
the
industrial
expansion
an
urban
working
class
evolved
in
Barcelona
Agitation
for
social
justice
and
regionalist
ferment
created
combustible
atmosphere
and
Barcelona
became
the
scene
of
strikes
and
anarchist
violence
The
modern
Socialist
Party
and
the
U.G.T.
Spainâs
largest
trade
union
were
both
founded
in
Barcelona
at
this
time
For
their
part
industrialists
sought
Catalan
autonomy
as
way
to
be
freed
from
interference
(and
taxation)
by
Madrid
In
1914
union
of
the
four
Catalan
provincesÂ âÂ Barcelona
Tarragona
Lleida
(LÃ©rida)
and
Girona
(Gerona)Â âÂ was
formed
known
as
the
Mancomunitat
with
limited
autonomy
The
region
profited
from
Spanish
neutrality
in
World
War
by
trading
with
both
sides
further
expanding
its
industry
The
Mancomunitat
was
dissolved
in
1924
by
the
Spanish
General
Primo
de
Rivera
who
established
military
dictatorship
and
once
again
banned
the
Catalan
language
Despite
this
setback
an
optimistic
Barcelona
plunged
energetically
into
the
preparation
of
another
International
Exhibition
with
monumental
buildings
pavilions
and
sports
facilities
erected
on
MontjuÃ¯c
hill
It
opened
few
months
before
the
stock
market
crash
of
1929
In
1931
general
elections
brought
the
Republican
party
to
power
and
King
Alfonso
XIII
escaped
in
exile
The
following
year
Catalonia
won
charter
establishing
home
rule
restoration
of
the
regional
parliament
and
flag
and
recognition
of
Catalan
as
the
official
language
of
the
region
For
the
next
several
years
the
pendulum
of
power
in
Spain
swung
back
and
forth
between
Left
and
Right
The
army
rebelled
in
1936
initiating
the
brutal
and
bloody
Spanish
Civil
War
in
which
both
sides
committed
atrocities
Many
of
Barcelonaâs
churches
were
put
to
the
torch
by
anti-clerical
mobs
The
city
firmly
Republican
briefly
became
the
capital
in
late
1937
and
was
rallying
point
for
the
International
Brigade
Barcelona
was
one
of
the
last
cities
to
fall
to
the
rebel
troops
of
General
Francisco
Franco
at
the
warâs
end
in
1939
The
Civil
War
ended
with
some
700,000
combatants
dead
on
both
sides;
another
30,000
were
executed
or
assassinated
including
many
priests
and
nuns;
and
perhaps
15,000
civilians
were
killed
in
air
raids
Barcelona
was
repeatedly
bombed
and
its
people
suffered
great
hardship
Catalonia
paid
heavy
price
in
defeat
Franco
abolished
all
regional
institutions
and
established
central
government
controls
The
Catalan
language
was
again
proscribed
even
in
schools
and
churches
For
years
Barcelona
received
little
financial
support
from
Madrid
and
Spain
remained
essentially
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
Europe
Nevertheless
the
cityâs
industry
recovered
and
at
least
one
million
job
hunters
from
less
prosperous
parts
of
Spain
migrated
to
the
Barcelona
area
From
the
1960s
tourism
boom
along
the
Costa
Brava
lifted
the
local
economy
and
brought
the
people
of
Francoâs
conservative
Spain
in
touch
with
modern
Europe
When
Franco
died
in
1975
Spain
rapidly
emerged
from
its
isolation
The
coronation
of
his
designated
successor
Juan
Carlos
the
grandson
of
Alfonso
XIII
brought
the
restoration
of
parliamentary
democracy
and
relaxation
of
customs
and
laws
The
1978
Constitution
granted
degrees
of
autonomy
to
Spainâs
fractious
regions
While
militant
Basque
minority
demanded
greater
independence
and
resorted
to
terrorist
tactics
that
continue
to
this
day
most
Catalans
were
content
with
the
restoration
of
the
Generalitat
and
regional
parliament
and
the
return
of
Catalan
as
an
official
language
Charismatic
Felipe
GonzÃ¡lez
Socialist
was
Prime
Minister
of
Spain
from
1982
to
1986
Spain
became
member
of
the
European
Economic
Community
(now
European
Union
or
EU)
in
1986
hastening
the
countryâs
modernization
Though
GonzÃ¡lez
was
credited
by
many
as
the
architect
of
the
new
Spain
he
finally
succumbed
to
incessant
charges
of
corruption
and
incompetence
in
the
highest
levels
of
his
government
The
EUâs
freeing
of
trade
tariffs
and
controls
and
Barcelonaâs
hosting
of
the
1992
Summer
Olympic
Games
acted
as
catalysts
for
the
city
and
CataloniaÂ âÂ Spainâs
industrial
engine
and
bridge
to
the
rest
of
EuropeÂ âÂ to
embark
on
significant
economic
boom
In
1996
the
surging
Partido
Popular
led
by
rather
uncharismatic
former
accountant
JosÃ©
MarÃ­a
Aznar
was
elected
forming
the
first
conservative
government
in
Spain
since
the
return
of
democracy
Barcelona
meanwhile
continued
to
be
ably
steered
by
progressive
Socialist
mayor
Pascual
Maragall
who
oversaw
the
Olympics
bid
and
subsequent
civic
works
that
contributed
to
the
transformation
of
the
city
Maragall
stepped
down
in
1999
to
run
for
leadership
of
the
Catalan
Generalitat
and
was
succeeded
by
Joan
Clos
Matheu
Where
to
Go
Most
visitors
to
the
Costa
del
Sol
are
based
in
one
of
the
large
coastal
resorts
to
the
west
of
MÃ¡laga
(Torremolinos
BenalmÃ¡dena
Fuengirola
Marbella
or
Estepona)
while
far
fewer
head
east
toward
Nerja
AlmuÃ±Ã©car
or
even
as
far
as
AlmerÃ­a
Although
the
main
aim
for
many
is
to
relax
on
the
beach
and
soak
up
as
much
sun
as
possible
increasing
numbers
arrive
to
play
golf
It
comes
as
little
surprise
therefore
that
the
road
signs
proclaim
the
area
west
of
MÃ¡laga
not
just
the
Costa
del
Sol
but
the
Costa
del
Golf
also
few
visitors
forsake
the
beach
for
day
or
two
and
venture
out
to
either
the
amazingly
varied
historic
towns
and
cities
or
the
natural
wonders
of
the
national
parks
nearby
MÃ¡laga
Ronda
and
perhaps
Gibraltar
can
be
seen
in
day
but
Sevilla
CÃ³rdoba
Granada
and
the
parks
necessitate
at
least
an
overnight
stop
MÃ¡laga
MÃ¡lagaâs
international
airport
is
the
gateway
to
the
Costa
del
Sol
and
AndalucÃ­a
for
most
people
However
few
visitors
spend
much
time
in
the
city
itself
This
is
shame
as
MÃ¡laga
is
an
ancient
AndalucÃ­an
city
of
not
inconsiderable
charm
that
offers
refreshing
taste
of
the
real
Spain
Founded
by
Phoenician
traders
more
than
3,000
years
ago
it
came
under
Carthaginian
and
Roman
rule
before
falling
to
the
Moorish
invasion
force
in
711
The
Moors
fortified
the
city
developing
the
settlement
into
major
trading
port
serving
Granada
and
it
was
one
of
the
last
cities
in
Spain
to
be
re-conquered
by
Christian
forces
in
1487
good
place
to
begin
tour
is
at
MÃ¡lagaâs
principle
landmark
Gibralfaro
(from
the
Arabic
Jebel
al
FaroÂ âÂ Lighthouse
Hill)
Located
some
130
(425
ft)
above
the
city
this
hilltop
is
capped
by
the
ramparts
of
Phoenician
castle
reconstructed
in
the
14th
century
by
the
Moors
(who
went
on
to
build
the
lighthouse
that
gave
Gibralfaro
its
name)
The
restored
walls
and
parapets
offer
superb
panoramic
view
of
both
the
city
below
and
the
coastline
disappearing
into
the
horizon
Because
it
looks
down
on
the
Plaza
de
Toros
the
hill
also
acts
as
free
seating
for
bullfights
taking
place
below
Although
it
is
possible
to
walk
here
it
is
not
recommended
Not
only
is
the
pathway
somewhat
difficult
in
places
it
is
also
well-known
hangout
for
muggers
Best
then
to
take
taxi
Back
at
sea
level
is
the
delightful
Paseo
del
Parque
with
contrasting
fountains
at
either
end
which
connects
the
old
town
with
the
Plaza
de
Toros
On
its
south
side
it
is
lush
seaside
tropical
garden
enhanced
by
fountains
duck
ponds
and
small
bars
The
other
side
is
home
to
the
smaller
JardÃ­nes
Puerta
Oscura
and
two
impressive
buildings
the
Ayuntamiento
(Town
Hall)
and
the
18th-century
La
Aduana
(Old
Custom
House)
Immediately
behind
here
is
the
sprawling
Alcazaba
fortress/palace
complex
that
the
Moors
built
between
the
11th
and
14th
centuries
cobbled
path
climbs
up
the
hillside
within
the
walls
to
the
portal
dubbed
Arco
del
Cristo
(Gateway
of
Christ)
The
victorious
Christian
army
of
Ferdinand
and
Isabella
celebrated
mass
here
when
the
fortress
finally
fell
into
their
hands

still
the
one-time
palace
(a
disappointment
compared
with
those
in
Granada
and
Sevilla)
contains
small
archaeological
museum
Beside
the
entrance
to
the
Alcazaba
are
the
partially
excavated
ruins
of
Roman
theater
the
only
visible
remains
of
the
ancient
city
short
walk
away
is
the
cathedral
known
locally
as
La
ManquitaÂ âÂ the
one-armed
ladyÂ âÂ because
one
of
its
twin
towers
remains
unfinished
The
north
tower
soars
100
(some
330
ft)
above
the
street
but
work
on
the
other
forlorn
stump
of
stone
stopped
in
1783
because
of
lack
of
money
MÃ¡laga
was
the
birthplace
of
Pablo
Ruiz
Picasso
though
the
young
artist
left
his
native
city
at
age
14
for
the
more
cosmopolitan
climates
of
Madrid
and
Barcelona
The
house
he
was
born
in
Casa
Natal
Picasso
at
Plaza
de
la
Merced
14
doubles
as
small
museum
and
research
center
On
larger
scale
is
the
nearby
Museo
de
Bellas
Artes
(Fine
Arts
Museum)
an
old
Renaissance-style
palace
with
pleasing
patios
In
late
1999
it
was
being
converted
into
the
future
Museo
Picasso
(Picasso
Museum)
The
Museo
de
Artes
Tradiciones
Populares
on
the
western
edge
of
the
old
town
is
easily
missed
but
that
would
be
mistake
Situated
in
the
Posada
de
la
Victoria
charming
early
17th-century
historic
inn
that
is
incongruous
with
its
surroundings
the
museum
offers
fascinating
glimpse
of
how
life
was
lived
in
MÃ¡laga
in
generations
past
On
the
way
back
to
the
center
of
MÃ¡laga
stop
for
moment
or
two
at
the
century-old
Mercado
Atarazanas
(market)
Each
morning
it
is
filled
with
women
admiring
the
bountiful
displays
of
meat
fish
fruit
and
vegetables
and
shopping
in
the
traditional
manner
for
fresh
not
plastic-wrapped
produce
This
is
also
the
western
boundary
of
collection
of
small
roads
and
pedestrian-only
streets
that
end
at
the
main
street
Calle
MarquÃ©s
de
Larios
and
combine
to
form
MÃ¡lagaâs
principal
shopping
center
You
can
buy
almost
anything
here
from
foodstuffs
to
footwear
but
be
advised
that
the
siesta
still
reigns
in
this
part
of
Spain
and
nothing
is
open
between
about
2pm
and
5pm
North
of
MÃ¡laga
Just
an
hourâs
drive
north
of
MÃ¡laga
lies
some
magnificent
mountain
scenery
The
national
park
of
El
Torcal
de
Antequera
is
high
limestone
plateau
that
has
been
eroded
by
rainwater
into
fantasy
landscape
of
fluted
pinnacles
and
towers
Hikers
can
explore
the
marked
trails
which
are
up
to
km
(3
miles)
in
length
and
wind
among
the
rocks
and
enjoy
panoramic
views
back
to
MÃ¡laga
and
the
distant
blue
Mediterranean
This
is
where
you
will
also
find
most
wonderful
small
hotel
La
Posada
del
Torcal
Near
the
town
of
Alora
you
will
find
the
breathtaking
gorge
known
as
the
Garganta
del
Chorro
Three
hundred
meters
(1,000
feet)
in
depth
this
sheer-sided
canyon
is
cut
by
the
Guadalhorce
River
It
is
also
accessible
from
MÃ¡laga
by
train;
ask
for
ticket
to
El
Chorro
An
improbable
concrete
catwalk
called
the
Camino
del
Rey
(The
Kingâs
Way)
crosses
vertical
cliff
and
continues
into
the
heart
of
the
gorge
dizzying
65
(200
ft)
above
the
river
It
was
built
in
the
1920s
to
provide
access
for
workers
digging
tunnels
for
hydroelectricity
project
The
artificial
dams
above
the
gorge
have
created
attractive
lakes
known
as
the
Pantanos
del
Chorro
Fringed
with
woods
sandy
beaches
and
campsites
they
constitute
refreshing
change
of
scenery
from
the
heat
and
bustle
of
the
coast
West
of
MÃ¡laga
Some
of
the
worldâs
most
popular
beach
resorts
line
the
coast
that
stretches
162
km
(100
miles)
to
the
Rock
of
Gibraltar
Torremolinos
Just
few
kilometers
west
of
MÃ¡lagaâs
international
airport
is
Torremolinos
In
the
late
1950s
and
early
1960s
it
was
the
first
resort
on
the
Costa
del
Sol
to
establish
reputation
as
popular
international
playground
Although
little
more
than
an
overgrown
village
it
was
haven
for
young
northern
Europeans
seeking
an
inexpensive
vacation
with
much
sun
sand
and
sangrÃ­a
Since
then
it
has
built
quite
literally
on
that
reputation
And
although
it
is
nowhere
as
inexpensive
even
relatively
as
it
once
was
it
is
still
highly
popular
tourist
destination
Wall-to-wall
hotels
and
apartments
reach
way
back
from
the
beaches
and
thereâs
no
denying
that
it
delivers
everything
sun-hungry
vacationers
could
wish
for
Its
miles
of
glorious
beaches
guaranteed
sun
cheap
alcohol
and
food
numerous
bars
discotheques
and
nightclubs
attract
clientele
that
is
largely
British
although
other
northern
European
countries
are
still
well
represented
here
(Even
fair
number
of
Americans
and
Russians
are
now
visiting.)
This
cosmopolitan
but
not
by
any
means
sophisticated
international
invasion
has
completely
overwhelmed
the
town
There
can
be
few
places
in
the
world
where
foreign
languages
principally
English
are
more
dominant
than
the
native
language
But
that
is
certainly
the
case
in
Torremolinos
Although
the
first
mention
of
the
town
dates
back
to
1498
there
is
really
nothing
here
of
historical
significance
The
town
itself
especially
Calle
San
Miguel
is
simply
profusion
of
shops
At
the
bottom
of
San
Miguel
series
of
winding
stairways
lined
by
shops
of
course
lead
down
towards
km
(nearly
mile)
sweep
of
golden
coastline
This
consists
of
six
beaches
connected
by
the
wonderful
Paseo
Maritimo
(beach
promenade)
and
broken
only
by
the
rocky
promontory
of
Castillo
de
Santa
Clara
which
separates
the
Bajondillo
(east)
and
Carihuela
(west)
sections
of
town
Chiringuitos
(small
beachside
restaurants)
are
in
plentiful
supply
especially
in
the
former
fishing
village
of
La
Carihuela
There
are
still
few
bona
fide
fishermen
about
and
if
you
can
manage
to
drag
yourself
out
of
bed
between
six
and
eight
in
the
morning
youâll
see
them
returning
to
shore
in
their
gaily
painted
flat-bottomed
wooden
boats
with
nets
of
sardines
and
anchovies
At
lunchtime
you
can
sample
the
morningâs
catch
skewered
on
wooden
stick
and
grilled
over
fire
on
the
beach
(see
page
97)
Many
other
popular
attractions
lie
close
at
hand
including
the
wave
pools
and
water
slides
of
Atlantis
Aquapark
the
horse
show
at
the
Club
El
Rancho
and
the
18-hole
course
of
the
nearby
Parador
del
Golf
But
the
biggest
draw
in
Torremolinos
continues
to
be
the
bars
discos
and
clubs
that
have
earned
the
resort
its
international
reputation
for
non-stop
nightlife
BenalmÃ¡dena-Costa
Heading
west
it
appears
at
first
glance
that
BenalmÃ¡dena-Costa
is
indistinguishable
from
its
close
neighbor
However
this
isnât
really
so
In
fact
it
is
somewhat
less
built
up
and
frenetic
than
Torremolinos
even
though
it
is
well
endowed
with
bars
discos
and
clubs
Its
fine
beaches
stretch
for
km
(over
miles)
beginning
at
the
large
and
attractive
Puerto
Deportivo
on
the
border
with
Torremolinos
Focal
points
are
the
three
Moorish
watch
towers;
the
pink
neo-Moorish
walls
of
Castillo
El
Bil-Bil
built
by
Frenchwoman
in
the
1930s
and
used
for
concerts
exhibitions
and
as
tourist
office;
and
one
of
the
Costa
del
Solâs
casinos
at
the
huge
and
impressive
Torrequebrada
complex
couple
of
kilometers
(about
mile)
inland
and
high
above
the
sea
lies
the
village
of
BenalmÃ¡dena-Pueblo
Its
Museo
ArqueolÃ³gico
de
Arte
Colombino
is
an
institution
of
national
importance
The
museum
takes
pride
in
its
collection
of
Pre-Columbian
art
(said
to
be
the
most
important
of
its
kind
in
Spain)
with
jewelry
statuary
and
ceramics
from
all
the
major
cultures
Also
in
the
BenalmÃ¡dena
area
is
the
TÃ­voli
World
amusement
park
in
the
suburb
of
Arroyo
de
la
Miel
(see
page
91)
the
Sea
Life
aquarium
in
the
Puerto
Deportivo
and
the
Eagle
Park
at
the
Colomares
Castle
Fuengirola
Nine
kilometers
(6
miles)
down
the
line
is
Fuengirola
another
resort
thatâs
hugely
popular
with
the
British
Here
bacon
and
eggs
fish
and
chips
darts
snooker
English
beer
and
bars
showing
English
soccer
games
are
the
norm
But
Fuengirola
has
assimilated
this
without
losing
its
Spanish
character
And
this
is
particularly
true
in
early
October
during
the
annual
fair
when
the
town
becomes
blaze
of
color
and
noise
and
most
every
man
woman
and
child
dons
typical
AndalucÃ­an
dress
Tradition
survives
too
as
the
commercial
fishing
fleet
is
an
ongoing
concern
The
Plaza
de
la
ConstituciÃ³n
in
the
town
center
has
numerous
pleasant
cafÃ©s
lining
the
square
beneath
the
church
bell
tower
and
nearby
is
the
bullring
and
the
small
Zoo
Municipal
Across
the
river
at
the
western
end
of
town
rise
the
remains
of
the
Castillo
de
Sohail
Abd-er-Rahman
III
built
this
hilltop
fortress
in
the
10th
century
and
gradually
settlement
grew
up
around
the
walls
Taken
by
the
Christians
in
bloody
battle
in
1487
Sohail
was
then
leveled
on
the
orders
of
the
âCatholic
kings.â
After
it
was
rebuilt
it
was
occupied
by
French
troops
during
the
Peninsular
War
who
left
behind
souvenir
of
their
stayÂ âÂ the
cannons
that
are
now
displayed
along
the
promenade
of
the
Paseo
MarÃ­timo
Other
attractions
here
include
variety
of
water
sports
marina
the
fishing
harbor
sailing
school
the
waterslides
of
the
Mijas
Aqua
Park
the
El
Cartujano
horse
show
and
horse
racing
at
the
newly
opened
Mijas
Hippodrome
Mijas
Eight
kilometers
(5
miles)
inland
from
Fuengirola
and
clinging
to
the
hillside
is
Mijas
Surrounded
by
modern
villas
and
urbanizaciones
(developments)
it
looks
from
the
outside
like
any
other
quaint
village
with
whitewashed
houses
But
Mijas
is
different
Most
of
the
houses
have
been
converted
into
upscale
shops
restaurants
or
bars
making
the
village
itself
unique
tourist
attraction
Traffic
is
banned
from
the
center
so
if
you
donât
feel
like
the
short
walk
from
the
parking
lot
take
mule
taxi
Mijas
has
Spainâs
only
square
bullring
and
across
from
it
beautifully
tended
gardens
slope
down
to
cliff-top
mirador
with
fine
views
all
along
the
coast
There
is
another
mirador
beside
the
car
park
On
one
side
of
this
natural
balcony
you
will
find
tiny
chapel
dedicated
to
the
Virgen
de
la
PeÃ±a
(Our
Lady
of
the
Mountain)
set
in
grotto
carved
from
living
rock
Marbella
Sheltered
by
the
mountains
of
the
Sierra
Blanca
on
one
side
and
with
the
Mediterranean
Sea
on
the
other
Marbella
has
earned
reputation
for
being
the
most
aristocratic
of
Costa
del
Solâs
resorts
This
began
in
the
1950s
when
Prince
Alfonso
von
Hohenlohe
bought
land
and
built
himself
luxurious
home
here
It
became
so
popular
with
his
guests
that
he
developed
it
into
the
Marbella
Club
Hotel
and
that
in
turn
launched
Marbella
as
trendy
gathering
place
for
the
jet
set
in
the
1960s
Today
the
town
is
playground
for
the
rich
and
famous
frequented
by
celebrities
and
politicians
royalty
and
business
tycoons
As
consequence
this
has
seen
the
further
development
both
here
and
along
the
coast
of
the
largest
collection
of
luxury
hotels
in
Spain
Naturally
then
prices
are
much
higher
here
than
in
the
other
coastal
resorts
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
in
terms
of
superior
standards
of
accommodation
service
and
cuisine
Marbella
is
certainly
town
of
two
parts
The
largest
by
far
is
the
modern
section
and
the
center
of
this
clustered
around
the
palm
trees
and
fountains
of
the
Parque
de
la
Alameda
is
taken
up
with
busy
sidewalk
cafÃ©s
smart
boutiques
banks
and
real
estate
agentsâ
offices
The
construction
of
four-lane
bypass
has
happily
put
an
end
to
the
crush
of
traffic
that
regularly
used
to
jam
this
part
of
town
It
is
at
its
most
attractive
though
by
the
sea
where
the
municipality
of
Marbella
encompasses
some
28
km
(17
miles)
of
beachfront
The
promenade
winds
along
the
beaches
of
El
Fuerte
and
Fontanilla
passing
marina
(Puerto
Deportivo)
with
moorings
for
several
hundred
pleasure
boats
overlooked
by
the
tall
spire
of
the
lighthouse
Some
lively
beach
bars
and
restaurants
make
this
popular
part
of
town
The
promenade
extends
west
for
mile
or
two
between
attractive
apartment
complexes
and
long
stretches
of
golden
sands
The
monuments
of
modern
Marbella
cling
to
the
hills
on
the
western
outskirts
The
King
of
Saudi
Arabiaâs
holiday
homeÂ 
âÂ it
looks
like
the
White
House
in
Washington
D.C.
only
slightly
largerÂ âÂ 
hides
behind
row
of
pines
and
palms
on
hilltop
just
above
the
highway
surrounded
by
high
security
fences
On
neighboring
rise
stands
Marbellaâs
modern-style
mosque
the
Mezquita
del
Rey
Abdulaziz
Al
Saud
which
is
open
to
the
public
every
afternoon
except
Friday
But
Marbella
has
its
historic
side
too
In
fact
its
history
dates
back
some
1,600
years
even
though
most
of
what
can
be
seen
in
the
town
at
least
dates
from
the
time
of
the
Catholic
Monarchs
and
later
North
of
the
main
road
the
Casco
Antiguo
(Old
Town)
provides
an
intriguing
glimpse
of
the
past
that
has
been
cleverly
integrated
to
cater
to
modern
visitors
First
sit
at
cafÃ©
table
in
the
Plaza
de
los
Naranjos
(Square
of
the
Orange
Trees)
where
you
can
admire
the
noble
16th-century
faÃ§ade
of
the
Casa
Consistorial
(Town
Hall)
and
soak
up
the
atmosphere
Then
wander
through
the
maze
of
narrow
twisting
streets
where
the
whitewashed
walls
are
decorated
with
colorful
baskets
of
flowers
As
you
explore
the
neighborhood
youâll
come
across
the
historic
parish
church
with
its
landmark
bell
tower
and
the
convents
of
La
Trinidad
and
San
Francisco
(it
is
said
that
Miguel
de
Cervantes
creator
of
the
famous
Don
Quixote
lodged
at
the
latter)
Uphill
from
the
church
lie
the
crumbling
walls
of
the
Moorish
castillo
Scattered
throughout
this
area
also
are
an
eclectic
array
of
shops
and
galleries
Other
places
of
interest
in
Marbella
are
the
Bonsai
Museum
the
only
one
in
Spain
and
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
and
the
Museum
of
Spanish
Contemporary
Engravings
Housed
in
structure
important
in
its
own
right
the
latter
is
the
first
of
its
kind
in
Spain
and
has
works
by
Picasso
MirÃ³
Tapies
and
other
such
famous
artists
Just
outside
of
Marbella
are
three
other
places
with
ancient
historic
connections:
the
Roman
Villa
mosaics
dating
from
the
first
and
second
centuries
at
RÃ­o
Verde
near
the
beach;
the
Paleo-Christian
basilica
Vega
del
Mar
in
San
Pedro
de
AlcÃ¡ntara;
and
the
Las
Bovedas
(The
Cellars)
Roman
baths
at
Guadalmina
With
the
increasing
popularity
of
Marbella
high
society
has
moved
west
to
the
chic
suburb
of
Nueva
AndalucÃ­a
and
its
magnificent
harbor
Puerto
BanÃºs
Sleek
unbelievably
expensive
yachts
line
the
quayside
and
Bentleys
Porsches
Rolls
Royces
and
Mercedes
adorn
the
streets
Thereâs
glamorous
line-up
of
expensive
restaurants
and
high-class
boutiques
that
seem
to
be
permanently
open
High
rollers
haunt
the
tables
in
the
nearby
Casino
Marbella
then
sip
martinis
and
watch
the
sun
rise
from
the
decks
of
their
luxury
yachts
Even
if
you
canât
quite
afford
to
join
in
itâs
fun
just
to
watch
how
the
other
half
lives
The
aquarium
in
Peurto
BanÃºs
may
be
small
but
it
is
interesting
nonetheless
This
part
of
the
Costa
del
Sol
is
also
golferâs
paradise
In
1999
nearly
30
golf
clubs
were
in
operation
between
MÃ¡laga
and
Sotogrande
These
courses
cater
to
all
levels
from
beginners
to
experts
taking
part
in
the
most
important
competitions
in
the
golf
worldâs
calendar
At
least
half
dozen
quality
courses
can
be
found
between
the
western
edge
of
Marbella
and
San
Pedro
de
AlcÃ¡ntara
OjÃ©n
Inland
from
Marbella
lie
the
high
peaks
of
the
Sierra
Blanca
the
most
distinctive
being
La
Concha
(The
Seashell)
which
rises
directly
above
the
town
scenic
road
leads
to

for
its
aguardiente
kind
of

pass
called
Puerto

Just

road
on

leads
to
the
Refugio

hunting
lodge
set
at
the
heart
of
large
national
game
reserve
The
peace
and
tranquility
found
here
has
attracted
numerous
famous
personalities
Not
least
of
these
is
General
Charles
de
Gaulle
of
France
who
finished
his
memoirs
here
in
1970
This
is
the
haunt
of
mountain
hare
partridge
and
the
ibex
(Capra

wild
mountain
goat
with
large

that
is
unique
to
Spain
Estepona
This
is
the
last
major
resort
town
on
the
western
part
of
the
Costa
del
Sol
and
it
provides
all
the
vacation
essentialsÂ âÂ 
good
beaches
golf
courses
restaurants
and
marinaÂ âÂ in
small-town
atmosphere
Low-rise
apartment
blocks
unpretentious
restaurants
and
hotels
overlook
the
palm-lined
Paseo
MarÃ­timo
promenade
furnished
with
park
benches
flower
displays
and
little
playground
Originally
Roman
settlement
Estepona
preserves
the
remains
of
Moorish
fortifications
and
watchtowers
an
18th-century
parish
church
and
an
expressionistic
bullring
startling
piece
of
modern
architecture
which
is
beginning
to
look
rather
worse
for
wear
On
either
side
of
the
town
itself
gracious
and
upscale
hotel
resorts
are
beginning
to
make
an
emblematic
impression
on
the
coastline
Beyond
Estepona
development
is
more
sporadic
though
there
are
some
luxury
resorts
at
Sotogrande
and
Puerto
Duquesa
About
km
(4
miles)
outside
of
town
mountain
road
takes
you
up
to
Casares
spectacular
white
hilltop
village
clinging
precariously
to
the
rugged
slopes
below
its
Moorish
fort
The
road
commands
sweeping
views
of
the
coast
and
countryside
and
on
clear
day
the
eye
is
inevitably
drawn
to
the
twin
peaks
flanking
the
Strait
of
GibraltarÂ âÂ the
Rock
of
Gibraltar
on
the
right
and
Moroccoâs
Jebel
Musa
on
the
left
These
were
known
to
the
ancients
as
the
Pillars
of
Hercules
and
in
ancient
times
marked
the
limits
of
the
known
world
Toward
Gibraltar
Gibraltar
looms
ever
larger
as
you
approach
San
Roque
which
was
established
by
Spanish
refugees
who
fled
the
Rock
when
the
English
captured
it
in
1704
Building
blocks
for
the
town
were
found
conveniently
in
the
nearby
ruins
of
Roman
Carteya;
today
though
little
remains
of
the
classical
site
Branch
off
the
N-340
here
and
head
for
La
LÃ­nea
de
la
ConcepciÃ³n
and
the
Rock
itself
La
LÃ­nea
has
experienced
mini-boom
since
the
border
with
Gibraltar
was
re-opened
in
1985
after
blockade
lasting
16
years
but
is
still
dreary
place
It
has
been
ascertained
that
Gibraltar
was
home
for
pre-historic
man
Neanderthal
skulls
were
found
in
1848
and
1928
and
Gibraltar
is
considered
one
of
the
final
bastions
for
this
species
Although
it
is
known
that
the
Phoenicians
Greeks
and
Carthaginians
were
aware
of
Gibraltar
and
that
the
Romans
ruled
here
from
about
500
b.c
to
a.d
475
no
town
was
ever
built
The
Visigoths
and
Vandals
destroyed
almost
all
traces
of
culture
in
the
area
and
it
wasnât
until
after
the
Moors
invaded
in
711
that
the
first
city
was
constructed
However
even
that
wasnât
until
nearly
450
years
later
in
1160
The
next
three
centuries
saw
numerous
battles
and
it
wasnât
until
1462
that
Gibraltar
was
finally
re-conquered
by
the
Spanish
In
the
early
18th
century
problems
over
succession
to
the
Spanish
throne
led
to
an
Anglo-Dutch
force
capturing
Gibraltar
in
1704
That
led
in
1713
to
the
treaty
of
Utrecht
under
which
Spain
ceded
its
rights
to
Gibraltar
to
the
British
However
the
Spanish
didnât
give
up
without
fightÂ âÂ more
than
one
actually
In
1727
they
failed
in
siege
and
in
1779
combined
Spanish
and
French
forces
totaling
50,000
laid
the
final
Great
Siege
against
just
5,000
defenders
After
four
years
of
much
hardship
the
siege
ended
in
1783
It
wasnât
until
1830
that
Gibraltar
achieved
the
status
of
British
crown
colony
which
it
holds
to
this
day
The
town
and
harbor
lie
on
the
east
slope
of
the
Rock
overlooking
the
bay
with
the
narrow
defile
of
Main
Street
cutting
through
the
middle
This
is
lined
with
duty-free
shops
selling
liquor
perfume
cameras
CD
players
video
recorders
and
electronic
goods
and
British-style
pubs
serving
pints
of
beer
and
bar
lunches
The
unit
of
currency
is
the
Gibraltarian
pound
(equal
to
the
British
pound)
but
shops
and
other
businesses
accept
pounds
sterling
and
pesetas
as
well
Also
at
sea
level
is
the
Gibraltar
Museum
housed
in
building
containing
what
are
considered
the
best
preserved
Moorish
baths
in
Europe
The
museum
has
interesting
exhibits
on
Gibraltarâs
history
Of
interest
too
is
Nelsonâs
Anchorage
where
Admiral
Nelsonâs
body
is
said
to
have
been
brought
in
barrel
of
rum
after
the
Battle
of
Trafalgar
on
21
October
1805
and
the
nearby
100-ton
Victorian
super-gun
the
largest
gun
of
its
type
in
the
world
Main
Street
ends
at
the
Referendum
Gates
Beyond
lies
the
cable-car
station
where
you
can
take
trip
to
the
top
of
the
Rock
with
stop
halfway
to
visit
the
Apesâ
Den
The
tail-less
Barbary
apes
that
inhabit
the
Rock
are
natives
of
North
Africa
descended
from
monkeys
brought
over
by
sailors
as
pets
and
shipsâ
mascots
Legend
has
it
that
if
the
apes
ever
leave
the
Rock
then
British
rule
will
come
to
an
end
When
the
apesâ
population
declined
significantly
during
World
War
II
Winston
Churchill
himself
was
worried
and
the
monkeys
have
been
on
special
rations
ever
since
The
views
from
the
summit
426
(396
ft)
up
are
spectacular
particularly
across
the
strait
to
Morocco
along
the
coast
toward
Estepona
and
down
the
sheer
east
face
of
the
Rock
to
the
water
holding
areas
(for
desalination)
and
the
beaches
of
Sandy
Bay
Catalan
Bay
and
Eastern
Beach
Whether
youâre
traveling
in
your
own
car
or
in
an
official
taxi
or
minivan
donât
leave
Gibraltar
without
taking
tour
of
the
Upper
Rock
Nature
Reserve
area
On
the
way
up
note
the
yellow
patches
and
their
accompanying
metal
rings;
these
were
used
when
manually
hauling
the
heavy
cannons
up
the
Rock
Also
of
interest
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
soil
on
the
Upper
Rock;
the
600
species
of
wildflower
here
grow
directly
out
of
the
limestone
from
which
the
Rock
is
formed
First
stop
is
Saint
Michaelâs
Cave
an
impressive
natural
grotto
that
is
sometimes
used
as
venue
for
musical
performances
Then
stop
to
see
the
apes
and
at
the
north
end
of
the
Rock
take
time
to
explore
the
Upper
Galleries
These
are
system
of
tunnels
blasted
through
the
inside
of
the
rock
face
during
the
Great
Siege
of
the
late
18th
century
Note
that
the
cannon
emplacements
slope
downward
clever
innovation
that
allowed
the
defenders
to
fire
directly
at
the
Spanish/French
forces
attacking
from
La
Linea
What
cannot
be
seen
is
the
51
km
(32
miles)
of
tunnels
that
were
excavated
during
World
War
II
and
it
is
from
these
that
General
Eisenhower
conducted
the
Allied
invasion
of
North
Africa
On
the
way
back
to
the
town
lies
the
Moorish
castle
which
apart
from
its
14th-century
tower
is
of
little
interest
Algeciras
Just
across
the
bay
from
Gibraltar
is
an
uninspiring
port
town
whose
only
saving
grace
on
good
days
at
least
is
its
unsurpassed
views
of
Gibraltar
From
the
harbor
hydrofoils
and
car
ferries
cross
the
strait
to
Ceuta
Spanish
protectorate
and
to
Tangier
in
Morocco
day
trip
to
Ceuta
is
certainly
possible
but
there
is
not
much
beyond
shopping
of
interest
there
Much
more
interesting
and
exciting
is
to
continue
on
about
25
miles
to
Tetuan
Morocco
parts
of
which
seem
to
have
remained
unchanged
for
centuries
Because
of
the
two-hour
time
difference
between
Ceuta
and
Morocco
itâs
difficult
but
possible
to
see
in
one
day
Therefore
an
overnight
stop
in
Ceuta
is
recommended

However
it
is
not
its

that
attracts
most
visitors
these
days
The
beaches
stretching
to
the
west
are
mecca
for
windsurfers
The
prevailing
wind
known
as
the
Poniente
is
from
the
west
making
the
beaches
among
the
windiest
in
Europe
The
windsurfers
are
not
the
only
ones
to
take
advantage
of
the
reliable
breeze;
the
hillsides
above
the
town
have
sprouted
veritable
forest
of
wind-powered
electricity
generators
In
spring
and
autumn
storks
buzzards
and

fill
the

as
they

before
gliding

on
their
annual
migration
congregating

East
of
MÃ¡laga
The
eastern
part
of
the
Costa
del
Sol
stretches
for
more
than
200
km
(125
miles)
from
MÃ¡laga
to
AlmerÃ­a
This
part
of
the
coast
has
different
feel
from
the
western
section
with
less
intensive
development
and
in
parts
much
rockier
and
attractive

Cave
paintings
and
prehistoric
remains
including
shrine
to
the
goddess
Noctiluca
have
been
found
and
there
is
beautiful
underground
lake
with

According
to
legend
five
Moorish
kings
buried
huge
treasure
inside
the

it
has
never
been

is
the
gateway
to
the
wine

region
of
the
AxarquÃ­a

lies
km
(2

VÃ©lez
sprawls
around
historic
center
dominated
by
Moorish
alcazaba
and
two
venerable

the
late-Gothic
Iglesia
de
San
Juan

and
the
Iglesia
de
Santa
MarÃ­a
(which
incorporates
section
of
the
townâs
former
mosque)
In
the
village
of
Torrox-Costa
as
elsewhere
on
the
eastern
Costa
self-catering
accommodations
predominate
over
hotels
Once
dedicated
to
fishing
and
agriculture
Torrox-Costa
is
now
an
expanding
resort
with
extensive
Roman
ruins
Nerja
Nerja
is
the
one
large
international
resort
to
the
east
of
MÃ¡laga
and
itâs
popular
destination
for
British
German
and
Scandinavian
vacationers
The
town
is
smaller
than
the
resort
towns
in
the
west
and
despite
the
intensive
development
in
the
hills
surrounding
it
has
also
managed
to
retain
some
of
its
village
atmosphere
The
nightlife
is
lively
though
quieter
than
in
Torremolinos
and
the
beaches
are
prettier
if
smaller
(Theyâre
tucked
into
rocky
coves.)
The
area
also
offers
good
opportunities
for
hiking
horseback
riding
scuba
diving
snorkeling
and
angling
giving
Nerja
the
edge
for
those
seeking
more
active

Inland
from
Nerja
the
corrugated
hills
of
the
Sierra
de
Tejeda
rise
up
toward
the
village
of
Frigiliana
Under
the
Moors
it
was
one
of
the
many
prosperous
villages
within
the
Kingdom
of
Granada
Today
the
historic
center
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
outstanding
examples
of
Moorish
village
architecture
on
the
Costa
del
Sol
with
lovely
16th-century
church
and
ruined
Moorish
castle
The
Far
East
After
Nerja
the
scenery
changes
dramatically;
the
mountains
begin
to
cascade
to
the
sea
and
the
panoramas
of
the
ragged
coastline
are
magnificent
Just
before
La
Herradura
rather
neat
little
town
with
nice
beach
road
signs
proclaim
that
you
are
now
in
the
Provincia
de

Until
you
pass
into
AlmerÃ­a
this
part
of
the
Costa
del
Sol
the
most
attractive
but
least
known
is
now
officially
called
the
Costa
Tropical
AlmuÃ±Ã©car
is
the
first
town
of
any
size
and
has
an
ancient
history
fine
aqueduct
stands
as
monument
to
the
skills
of
the
Roman
engineers
who
constructed
it
during
the
reign
of
Antoninus
Pius
in
the
second
century
a.d
port
for
Granada
in
Moorish
times
AlmuÃ±Ã©car
continued
to
enjoy
certain
prestige
after
the
Reconquest
when
Juan
de
Herrera
the
architect
of
El
Escorial
Philip
IIâs
grand
monastery
cum
palace
near
Madrid
was
commissioned
to
design
the
parish
church
These
days
the
town
set
around
an
attractive
curving
beach
is
an
increasingly
popular
family
resort
Along
the
road
from
AlmuÃ±Ã©car
pretty
villas
with
spectacular
coastal
views
dot
the
hillsides
until
all
of
sudden
the
scenery
changes
dramatically
As
the
coast
flattens
out
town
of
whitewashed
houses
atop
rocky
cone-shaped
hill
comes
into
view
Called
SalobreÃ±a
it
makes
for
an
impressive
sight
Moorish
castle
beautifully
restored
stands
isolated
at
the
heart
of
the
village
SalobreÃ±a
stands
as
the
gateway
to
the
agriculturally
rich
vega
(plain)
of
the
thriving
port
city
of
Motril
Sugarcane
the
source
of
the
greenery
flourishes
here
The
sugar
refineries
in
the
area
have
earned
the
town
its
nicknameÂ âÂ Little
Cuba
Like
that
country
Motril
is
known
for
its
rum
although
its
residents
are
crafty
enough
to
make
just
about
enough
for
local
consumption
and
no
more
Motril
and
SalobreÃ±a
have
their
own
extensive
beaches
and
there
are
many
more
to
come
as
the
road
continues
eastward
The
next
40
km
(25
miles)
is
conservation
area
and
the
least
developed
of
any
section
of
the
Costa
del
Sol
The
small
towns
and
villages
reminiscent
of
what
the
rest
of
the
coastline
used
to
be
like
before
the
mass
tourist
invasion
have
very
limited
supply
of
hotels
which
means
that
even
in
midsummer
the
beaches
are
far
from
overcrowded
Whatâs
more
itâs
possible
to
be
swimming
in
the
Mediterranean
while
the
snow-covered
peaks
of
the
Sierra
Nevada
shimmer
in
the
distance
This
scenery
changes
and
much
for
the
worse
after
Adra
an
important
fishing
and
fish
processing
center
The
N-340
crosses
vast
and
dreary
plain
where
every
available
piece
of
level
land
has
been
covered
by
ugly
plastic
greenhouses
that
produce
much
of
Europeâs
winter
vegetables
The
road
rejoins
the
coast
at
Aguadulce
where
tourists
mainly
Spanish
enjoy
good
beaches
new
golf
courses
and
marinas
Here
the
mountains
meet
the
sea
again
and
the
journey
onto
AlmerÃ­a
is
short
but
attractive
AlmerÃ­a
Rich
in
history
AlmerÃ­a
was
once
the
most
important
city
in
Moorish
Spain
The
AlmerÃ­a
of
today
is
pleasant
provincial
capital
thatâs
worth
visit
if
your
travels
take
you
to
the
eastern
limits
of
the
Costa
del
Sol
There
are
only
two
major
sights
Abd-er-Rahman
IIIâs
massive
Alcazaba
looms
large
on
the
hilltop
above
the
city
Although
an
earthquake
caused
extensive
damage
in
1522
the
crenellated
ocher
outer
walls
and
section
of
the
turreted
ramparts
stand
firm
providing
wide-ranging
vistas
over
the
city
and
the
sea
And
the
forbidding
fortified
cathedral
that
stands
just
inland
from
the
waterfront
Paseo
de
AlmerÃ­a
was
built
during
the
16th
century
when
Barbary
pirates
were
terrorizing
the
coast
(see
page
18)
Inland
from
AlmerÃ­a
lies
one
of
the
most
un-European
landscapes
on
the
European
continent
The
Sierra
de
Alhamilla
is
desert
of
barren
mountains
rocky
ravines
and
dry
gravel
riverbeds;
spiky
agave
plants
and
prickly
pears
are
the
only
vegetation
The
regionâs
uncanny
resemblance
to
the
American
West
made
it
popular
film
location
for
spaghetti
westerns
including
such
classics
as
Fistful
of
Dollars
and
The
Good
the
Bad
and
the
Ugly
which
set
young
Clint
Eastwood
on
the
road
to
stardom
in
Hollywood
Near
the
village
of
Tabernas
is
an
area
known
as
Mini-Hollywood
where
two
spaghetti-western
film
sets
have
been
preserved
as
tourist

with
horses
cowboys
and

Inland
Excursions
For
complete
contrast
to
the
sun
sea
and
sangrÃ­a
atmosphere
of
the
coast
you
need
only
drive
inland
for
few
hours
to
reach
the
cultural
historical
and
architectural
attractions
of
Ronda

Most
of
the
other
destinations
require
an
overnight
stay
Ronda
The
opening
of
an
improved
road
from
San
Pedro
de
AlcÃ¡ntara
to
Ronda
has
ended
the
isolation
of
this
mountain
area
and
shortened
the
driving
time
from
the
coast
to
an
hour
One
of
the
most
spectacularly
situated
towns
in
Europe
Ronda
sits
atop
cliff-bound
plateau
cleaved
through
the
middle
by
sheer-sided
gorge
The
older
Moorish
part
of
town
(La
Ciudad)
lies
to
the
south
of
the
ravine
linked
by
an
18th-century
bridge
to
El
Mercadillo
the
modern
district
that
arose
after
the
Reconquista
The
gorge
known
as
El
Tajo
is
deep
and
narrow
crevasse
that
plunges
150
(490
ft)
to
the
foaming
RÃ­o
GuadalevÃ­n
tributary
of
the
Guadiaro
River
During
the
Civil
War
nationalist
sympathizers
in
the
town
were
hurled
to
their
deaths
in
the
gorge
an
event
recalled
by
Hemingway
in
his
novel
For
Whom
the
Bell
Tolls
You
can
enjoy
superb
view
of
the
Tajo
and
the
patchwork
of
fields
beyond
from
the
Puente
Nuevo
(New
Bridge)
built
in
1788
as
well
as
from
the
walkways
that
follow
the
edge
of
the
gorge
Cross
the
bridge
into
the
Ciudad
the
old
Moorish
enclave
which
remained
impervious
to
Christian
assault
until
1485
to
see
most
of
Rondaâs
most
important
monuments
On
one
side
of
the
Plaza
de
Campillo
square
stands
the
Palacio
de
MondragÃ³n
constructed
by
Abomelic
King
of
Ronda
in
1314
and
later
taken
over
by
the
Christian
conquerors
Renaissance
portal
distinguished
later
addition
opens
onto
spacious
courtyards
where
horseshoe
arches
Arabic
inscriptions
and
distinctive
tile
ornaments
indicate
the
Moorish
origins
of
this
grand
building
block
or
so
away
Rondaâs
original
mosque
survives
in
the
form
of
the
Church
of
Santa
MarÃ­a
la
Mayor
The
minaret
was
converted
into
bell
tower
and
Gothic
nave
was
tacked
on
to
the
original
structure
followed
by
high
altar
in
ornate
16th-century
Plateresque
style
and
some
finely
carved
Baroque
choir
stalls
The
church
overlooks
the
Plaza
de
la
Duquesa
de
Parcent
the
main
square
with
the
long
elegant
faÃ§ade
of
the
Ayuntamiento
(Town
Hall)
gracing
another
side
Heading
back
toward
the
Puente
Nuevo
stop
to
view
the
exterior
of
the
Palacio
del
MarquÃ©s
de
Salvatierra
an
18th-century
Renaissance
mansion
famous
for
its
wrought-iron
balconies
made
in
the
traditional
Ronda
style
Note
also
the
carved
stone
figures
above
the
entrance
Nearby
stands
La
Casa
del
Rey
Moro
(The
Moorish
Kingâs
House)
which
is
curious
combination
of
the
water
mine
and
gardens
designed
by
the
French
landscaper
Jean
Claude
Nicolas
Forestier
in
the
1920s
Beyond
here
the
road
curves
down
toward
the
Tajo
where
two
more
bridgesÂ âÂ the
Puente
Viejo
(Old
Bridge)
built
in
1616
on
top
of
Roman
foundations
and
the
Moorish
Puente
ArabeÂ âÂ span
the
gorge
and
offer
striking
views
of
the
chasm
Down
by
the
river
stands
the
BaÃ±os
Ãrabes
(Moorish
Baths)
with
the
vaulted
roof
still
intact
Immediately
back
across
the
Puente
Nuevo
Parador
hotel
occupies
what
was
the
old
Town
Hall
and
just
beyond
that
is
Rondaâs
Neoclassical
Plaza
de
Toros
one
of
the
oldest
bullrings
in
Spain
Inaugurated
in
1785
it
is
regarded
as
the
birthplace
of
the
modern
bullfight
and
is
something
of
shrine
to
aficionados
of
the
corrida
It
has
small
but
very
interesting
museum
below
the
arcaded
arena
CÃ¡diz
The
ancient
city
of
CÃ¡diz
sitting
at
the
end
of
very
narrow
peninsula
of
land
that
runs
parallel
to
the
coast
was
founded
by
the
Phoenicians
in
1100
b.c
and
is
considered
to
be
Spainâs
oldest
town
In
fact
CÃ¡dizâs
amazing
amalgam
of
history
is
not
readily
apparent
with
only
the
remains
of
the
old
Roman
Theater
to
give
much
evidence
of
the
cityâs
age
It
was
re-conquered
by
Alfonso
in
1262
and
granted
the
Monopoly
of
Trade
with
Africa
by
the
Catholic
Monarchs
in
1493
Columbus
also
departed
from
this
city
on
his
second
and
fourth
voyages
in
1493
and
1502
respectively
In
the
latter
part
of
the
16th
century
it
twice
came
under
attack
by
enemy
naval
forces
and
period
of
prosperity
ensued
when
the
Casa
de
ContrataciÃ³n
or
the
monopoly
rights
for
trade
with
the
Americas
was
transferred
from
Sevilla
by
order
of
Felipe
in
1717
century
later
on
19
March
1812
while
under
attack
from
Napoleonâs
forces
the
national
parliament
met
in
the
St
Felipe
Neri
Church
and
proclaimed
the
first
Spanish
parliament
Of
most
interest
in
the
town
today
is
the
architecturally
contrasting
Baroque
and
Classical
cathedral
which
was
constructed
between
1772
and
1838
The
elegant
Hospital
de
Mujeres
(Womenâs
Hospital)
built
even
earlier
in
1749
is
notable
for
its
patio
and
art
collection
including
fine
El
Greco
The
curious
and
unusual
Oratorio
de
la
Santa
Cueva
(Church
of
Santa
Cueva)
has
original
underground
chapels
dating
from
1783
Of
more
interest
is
the
domed
upper
chapel
added
in
1796
whose
ceiling
is
adorned
by
five
spectacular
paintingsÂ âÂ three
of
which
are
fine
examples
of
Goyaâs
work
The
St
Felipe
Neri
Church
mentioned
above
is
also
well
worth
look
Built
in
1679
it
has
towering
columns
and
an
unusual
elliptical
dome
El
Puerto
de
Santa
MarÃ­a
This
small
town
on
the
coast
of
the
Bay
of
CÃ¡diz
looks
across
to
the
town
of
the
same
name
and
has
considerable
charm
It
is
generally
overlooked
by
foreign
visitors
but
the
Spanish
flock
here
in
the
thousands
especially
during
August
Then
when
there
are
series
of
bullfights
the
seafood
and
shellfish
restaurants
for
which
El
Puerto
is
famous
are
full
to
overflowing
until
the
early
hours
In
fact
there
isnât
too
much
to
see
here
but
thatâs
okayÂ âÂ El
Puerto
de
Santa
MarÃ­a
is
one
of
those
places
that
is
to
be
savored
for
its
ambience
Positioned
between
Jerez
de
la
Frontera
and
CÃ¡diz
El
Puerto
is
easily
reached
by
road
or
rail
However
the
most
delightful
way
to
get
here
is
on
the
small
ferryboat
El
Adriano
which
plies
its
way
between
the
center
of
CÃ¡diz
and
the
dockside
in
El
Puerto
Jerez
de
la
Frontera
The
name
of
this
town
is
indicative
of
two
things
It
once
lay
close
to
the
frontier
of
the
old
Moorish
kingdom
of
Granada
hence
de
la
Frontera
And
Jerez
(pronounced
khay-reth)
gave
its
name
to
the
wine
that
has
made
the
town
famous
better
known
to
the
world
in
its
anglicized
versionÂ âÂ sherry
Although
known
as
long
ago
as
the
Phoenician
era
Jerez
first
came
to
prominence
under
the
Moors
in
the
11th
and
12th
centuries
and
it
is
from
that
period
that
the
impressively
walled
and
towered
AlcÃ¡zar
dates
Inside
is
simple
but
elegant
mosque
that
was
later
converted
into
chapel
dedicated
to
Santa
MarÃ­a
la
Real
Re-conquered
by
King
Alfonso
in
1264
it
became
one
of
the
most
prosperous
towns
in
AndalucÃ­a
after
the
discovery
of
the
Americas
and
the
reunification
of
Spain
in
1492
Below
the
AlcÃ¡zar
lies
the
Colegiata
(Collegiate
Church)
towering
dark
stone
cathedral
dating
from
the
17th
to
18th
centuries
Housed
within
is
the
precious
image
of
Cristo
de
la
ViÃ±a
(Christ
of
the
Vineyard)
It
was
the
development
of
the
sherry
wine
and
brandy
business
that
brought
the
city
worldwide
acclaim
and
more
prosperity
It
is
impossible
to
walk
the
streets
without
recognizing
bodegas
(wineries)
of
prestigious
old
firms
such
as
Harvey
Williams
Humbert
Gonzalez-Byass
and
Pedro
Domecq
As
some
of
the
names
imply
it
was
group
of
English
merchants
who
launched
Jerez
as
the
world
capital
of
fortified
wine
Three
centuries
on
their
descendants
continue
to
control
the
sherry
trade
All
the
larger
companies
offer
tours
of
their
bodegas
mostly
on
weekday
mornings
and
some
require
you
to
reserve
in
advance
Traditional
hospitality
means
of
course
that
every
tour
ends
with
tasting
session
Jerez
is
also
famous
for
its
horses
The
sherry-producing
aristocracy
built
vast
ranches
alongside
the
vineyards
which
provided
an
ideal
environment
for
horse
breeding
And
the
Domecq
family
established
the
world-famous
Real
Escuela
Andaluza
del
Arte
Ecuestre
(Royal
AndalucÃ­an
Riding
School)
in
1973
as
showcase
for
AndalucÃ­an
equestrian
skills
The
schoolâs
Thursday
dressage
exhibitions
are
must-see
and
the
annual
Horse
Fair
in
early
May
is
colorful
event
Jerez
has
more
subtle
attractions
also
In
addition
to
the
expected
numerous
churches
palaces
and
mansions
look
especially
for
the
AndalucÃ­an
Flamenco
Center
in
the
distinguished
PemartÃ­n
Palace
and
the
striking
Clock
Museum
in
its
own
delightful
gardens
Sevilla
The
capital
of
AndalucÃ­a
Sevilla
is
the
most
Spanish
of
Spanish
cities
One
of
the
most
beautiful
cities
in
the
world
it
has
sensual
spiritual
and
romantic
ambience
It
was
already
thriving
riverside
settlement
when
Julius
Caesar
arrived
in
45
b.c.
and
under
the
Romans
it
developed
into
major
town
In
fact
two
Roman
emperors
Hadrian
and
Trajan
were
born
in
nearby
ItÃ¡lica
Subsequently
Sevilla
became
the
capital
of
the
Visigothic
kingdom
and
then
of
Moorish
taifa
before
falling
to
King
Ferdinand
III
in
1248
monopoly
of

the
city
to
its
peak
during
the
Golden
Age
âMadrid
is
the

of
Spain,â
the
saying
went
âbut
Sevilla
is

The
two

in
the
city
are
located
around
the

after
the

was
razed
The

followed
the

of
the
old
mosque
accounting
for
its
unusually
broad
rectangular
form
Massive
without

within
the

contains
over
30
chapels
including
the

made
from
the
first

back
by
Cristobal
ColÃ³n
(Christopher
Columbus)
from
the
New

The
Great
Navigator
himself
is
interred
nearby
in
the
ornate
19th-century
sarcophagus
by
the
south
entrance
His
remains
were
transferred
to
Sevilla
from
Havana
in
1898
when
Cuba
won
its
independence
from
Spain
On
the
north
side
of
the
cathedral
lies
the
Patio
de
los
Naranjos
(Court
of
the
Orange
Trees)
the
ceremonial
courtyard
of
the
old
mosque
with
its
original
ablutions
fountains
The
minaret
dating
from
1184
was
preserved
as
the
bell
tower
of
the
cathedral;
this
celebrated
Giralda
tower
is
Sevillaâs
most
famous
landmark
The
exterior
is
beautifully
decorated
with
typical
sebka
design
work
It
contrasts
vividly
with
the
bland
interior
where
series
of
35
gently
elevating
ramps
lead
to
an
observation

height
of

ft)
Ferdinand
III
rode
his
horse
to
the
top
following
the
Reconquista
in
1248
This
is
the
finest
mirador
in
Sevilla
and
provides
for
unparalleled
views
of
the
old
city
below
It
is
surprising
to
note
just
how
large
the
Plaza
de
Toros
is
when
seen
at
this
angle
Look
up
and
you
will
see
how
the
tower
came
by
its
name
In
1356
an
earthquake
destroyed
the
original
ornamental
top
And
it
wasnât
until
1558
that
the
addition
of
the
huge
bells
and
weather
vane
(Giralda
in
Spanish)
in
the

and
its
several
courtyards
incorporate
fragments
of
an
earlier
Moorish
fortress
and
blend

motifs
with

designs
visit
begins
with
tour
of
the
Cuarto
del
Almirante
(the
Admiralâs
Apartments)
where
painting
of
the
Virgen
de
los
Mareantes
(Virgin
of
the
Mariners)
in
the
chapel
shows
Columbus
sheltered
beneath
the
Virginâs
cloak
The
most
interesting
part
is
the
Patio
de
las
Doncellas
(Courtyard
of
the
Maidens)
where
the
rooms
preserve
outstanding
decorative
featuresÂ âÂ ornamental
tiles
carved
stucco
and
characteristic
coffered
artesonado
ceilings
The
ornate
domed
SalÃ³n
de
Embajadores
(Hall
of
the
Ambassadors)
is
equal
to
anything
in
the
palace
of
the
Alhambra
Next
door
is
the
glass-roofed
Patio
de
las
MuÃ±ecas
(Courtyard
of
the
Dolls)
so
named
for
the
two
tiny
human
faces
carved
into
the
decoration
surrounding
one
of
the
Moorish
arches
These
are
very
unusual
as
Muslim
crafts-
men
were
forbidden
by
their
religion
to
depict
the
human
form
in
their
art
Returning
to
the
entrance
courtyard
take
the
narrow
passage
on
the
right
to
the
Patio
de
Maria
Padilla
which
sits
on
top
of
underground
baths
The
apartments
beyond
are
hung
with
Flemish
tapestries
recording
Charles
Vâs
Tunis
Expedition
of
1535
one
of
them
showing
an
upside-down
map
of
the
Mediterranean
Not
to
be
missed
either
are
the
extensive
and
beautiful
gardens
an
oasis
of
tranquillity
in
this
perpetually
busy
city
Nestled
around
the
walls
of
the
Alcazar
is
the
Barrio
de
Santa
Cruz
the
old
Jewish
quarter
picturesque
maze
of
whitewashed
houses
narrow
lanes
and
tiny
shaded
patios
that
invite
leisurely
exploration
Just
south
of
the
cathedral
stands
the
former
exchange
building
Casa
Lonja
which
is
now
the
Archivo

The
unusual
Cuban
wooden

of
interest
as
well
as
the
documents
relating
to
the
discovery
and
conquest
of
the
Americas
that
rest
on
them
Nearby
on
the
banks
of
the
river
is
another
of
Sevillaâs
icons
The
Moorish
Torre
del
Oro
(Tower
of
Gold)
is
named
after
the
gold-colored
tiles
that
once
covered
the
walls
of
this
early
13th-century
chess-piece
castle
It
is
all
that
remains
of
Sevillaâs
medieval
fortifications
and
in
times
of
possible
invasion
huge
metal
chain
was
hauled
from
here
to
the
other
riverbank
to
protect
the
harbor
Originally
used
to
store
treasures
brought
from
the
Americas
it
was
also
used
as
prison
and
is
now
maritime
museum
The
round
top
and
spire
were
added
in
the
middle
of
the
18th
century
visit
to
the
Museo
de
Bellas
Artes
(Museum
of
Fine
Arts)
housed
in
an
early
17th-century
convent
and
the
second
most
important
museum
in
Spain
will
remind
visitors
that
Sevilla
is
the
birthplace
of
two
of
Spainâs
greatest
artists
VelÃ¡zquez
and
Murillo
There
are
of
course
far
too
many
other
places
of
interest
to
mention
here
but
those
with
little
extra
time
should
visit
the
following
The
Casa
de
Pilatos
the
Hospital
de
la
Caridad
(Charity
Hospital)
the
Bullfighting
Museum
and
Plaza
de
Toros
the
Parque
de
los
Descubrimientos
(Discovery
Park)
on
the
site
of
Expo
â92
and
the
pedestrian
shopping
district
centered
on
the
Calle
de
las
Sierpes
Donât
forget
that
two
of
Europeâs
best-known
festivals
take
place
here
each
spring
the
Semana
Santa
(Holy
Week)
parades
and
the
FerÃ­a
de
Abril
celebration
Carmona
Carmona
20
km
or
so
(12
miles)
east
of
Sevilla
on
the
road
to
CÃ³rdoba
sits
like
beacon
on
top
of
the
only
hill
on
an
otherwise
unrelenting
plain
That
position
has
given
it
strategic
importance
during
its
5,000-year
old
history
It
was
the
Roman
era
though
that
brought
the
area
prosperity
and
wealth
and
the
Museo
Necropolis
is
the
largest
Roman
necropolis
outside
of
Rome
itself
The
townâs
fortunes
declined
after
the
Romans
left
but
the
Moorish
invasion
of
713
brought
with
it
renewed
growth
and
prosperity
The
Moorsâ
reign
ended
in
1247
when
Carmona
was
re-conquered
by
King
Ferdinand
II
The
town
was
divided
among
the
victors
principally
the
orders
of
Santiago
and
Calatrava
The
14th
and
15th
centuries
were
troublesome
times
as
well
The
discord
was
only
brought
to
an
end
when
in
1630
Felipe
IV
agreed
to
grant
Carmona
the
rights
of
township
Carmonaâs
history
is
also
unique
because
the
town
was
never
under
feudal
rule
and
was
protected
as
satellite
of
the
crown
It
is
for
this
reason
that
there
is
such
an
extraordinary
number
of
palaces
mansions
convents
and
churches
in
Carmona
These
alone
make
it
worth
visit
and
the
two
gates
that
linked
the
old
card
maxim
(Roman
road)
Displays
(Sevilla)Â and
Cordoba
(CÃ³rdoba)
shouldnât
be
missed
(Displays
is
especially
interesting;
the
gate
is
an
unusually
shaped
small
fortress.)
CÃ³rdoba
These
days
CÃ³rdoba
minor
provincial
city
sandwiched
between
Sevilla
and
Granada
is
often
passed
over
by
visitors
to
AndalucÃ­a
But
to
do
so
is
considerable
mistake
Besides
having
much
charm
it
has
fabulous
historic
connections
and
an
eclectic
array
of
attractions
to
match
CÃ³rdoba
was
once
the
largest
city
in
Roman
Spain
the
capital
of
the
province
of
Batik
and
the
birthplace
of
Seneca
the
Younger
philosopher
and
tragedian
Its
golden
era
was
between
the
mid-8th
and
very
early
11th
centuries
when
it
was
the
center
of
the
great
medieval
Caliphate
of
CÃ³rdoba
With
population
of
half
million
it
was
one
of
the
worldâs
largest
and
most
cultured
cities
and
the
splendid
capital
of
the
western
Islamic
Empire
It
had
the
first
university
and
street
lighting
in
Europe
and
library
with
more
than
400,000
volumes
The
city
is
dominated
by
the
greatest
surviving
monument
from
that
period
(which
has
the
distinction
of
being
the
oldest
monument
in
day-to-day
use
in
the
Western
world)Â âÂ the
Great
Mosque
otherwise
known
as
La
Mezquita
Construction
on
the
mosque
was
begun
in
786
but
it
was
enlarged
three
times
before
attaining
its
present
size
in
987
It
covers
an
astounding
area
of
hectares
(5
acres)
CÃ³rdoba
was
re-conquered
in
1236
and
two
small
Christian
chapels
were
added
in
1258
and
1260
No
further
major
changes
were
made
until
the
early
16th
century
when
Carlos
decided
to
construct
Christian
cathedral
in
the
center
of
the
mosque
Several
gateways
provide
access
through
the
high
wall
surrounding
La
Mezquita
the
most
impressive
being
the
monumental
MudÃ©jar
Puerta
del
PerdÃ³n
(Gate
of
Forgiveness)
Pass
through
it
into
the
ceremonial
forecourt
of
the
Patio
de
los
Naranjos
with
its
fountains
and
venerable
orange
trees
to
reach
the
entrance
to
the
mosque
Inside
as
your
eyes
adjust
to
the
dim
light
you
will
see
mesmerizing
rows
of
columns
extending
into
the
shadows
in
every
direction
Antique
shafts
of
porphyry
onyx
marble
and
jasper
they
seem
to
grow
out
of
the
paving
stones
like
trees
in
an
enchanted
forest
The
double
arches
overhead
striped
in
red-and-white
form
fanciful
canopy
of
curving
branches
At
the
far
end
set
in
the
southeast
wall
is
the
splendid
10th-century
mihrab
lined
with
marble
and
gold
mosaics
and
the
maksourah
the
enclosure
where
the
caliph
attended
to
his
prayers
In
the
central
area
of
the
mosque
restorers
have
exposed
to
view
section
of
the
original
carved
and
painted
wooden
ceiling
which
was
covered
over
with
vaulting
in
the
18th
century
The
cathedral
found
at
the
very
center
of
the
forest
of
pillars
presents
an
overpowering
contrast
to
its
immediate
surroundings
The
understated
simplicityÂ âÂ and
lack
of
human
imagesÂ âÂ of
Islamic
design
fades
completely
and
is
replaced
with
an
ornate
blaze
of
color
within
which
human
images
in
either
paint
stone
or
wood
abound
Around
the
walls
more
Christian
chapels
line
the
perimeter
of
the
mosque
North
of
the
La
Mezquita
lies
the
labyrinth
of
narrow
streets
that
makes
up
the
Barrio
de
la
JuderÃ­a
(Jewish
Quarter)
Some
of
the
best
restaurants
and
tapas
bars
in
CÃ³rdoba
are
to
be
found
here
Sights
to
look
for
include
the
Callejon
de
las
Flores
(Alley
of
the
Flowers)
which
is
lined
with
houses
built
around
flower-filled
patios
that
are
typical
of
CÃ³rdoba
and
the
14th-century
sinagoga
(synagogue)
in
the
street
called
Judios
Itâs
modest
affair
just
one
small
room
with
balcony
for
female
worshippers
CÃ³rdobaâs
Jews
helped
the
Moors
to
gain
control
of
the
city
in
711
and
they
lived
in
peace
under
the
caliphate
Perhaps
the
most
illustrious
resident
of
the
neighborhood
was
Moses
MaimÃ³nides
And
statue
of
the
12th-century
doctor
philosopher
and
theologian
stands
few
steps
from
the
synagogue
in
the
square
named
in
his
honor
Plaza
de
MaimÃ³nides
Also
in
the
plaza
is
the
Casa
de
las
Bulas
which
holds
the
interesting
combination
of
small
market
of
CÃ³rdoban
craftspeople
selling
silver
filigree
and
tooled
leather
goods
and
the
Museo
Taurino
(Bullfighting
Museum)
Northeast
of
the
mosque
on
the
Plaza
JerÃ³nimo
PaÃ©z
the
splendid
Renaissance
Palacio
PaÃ©z
houses
the
Museo
ArqueolÃ³gico
Provincial
The
exhibits
span
the
centuries
from
the
Iberian
era
to
the
Visigothic
period
but
pride
of
place
goes
to
objects
from
the
10th-century
palace
of
Medina
Azahara
like
the
bronze
figure
of
stag
taken
from
fountain
presented
by
the
Byzantine
emperor
Constantine
VII
Christian
king
Alfonso
XI
built
CÃ³rdobaâs
AlcÃ¡zar
de
los
Reyes
Cristianos
overlooking
the
river
to
the
southwest
of
the
mosque
The
ramparts
offer
fine
view
over
the
old
town
and
the
river
the
islets
in
midstream
each
occupied
by
ruined
Moorish
mill
and
the
ridges
of
the
Sierra
de
CÃ³rdoba
low
on
the
northern
horizon
The
Catholic
Monarchs
received
Columbus
and
planned
the
invasion
of
Granada
while
residents
here
Other
places
that
are
worth
visit
are
the
16th
century
Palacio
de
los
Marqueses
de
Viana
with
its
13
patios
and
the
Plaza
de
la
Corredera
dating
from
the
17th
century
It
is
the
only
Castilian-style
plaza
in
AndalucÃ­a
Stroll
to
the
unusual
Plaza
del
Potro
which
gets
its
name
from
the
fountain
in
the
center
dating
from
1577
It
is
home
to
two
interesting
museums:
the
Museo
de
Bellas
Artes
(Fine
Arts
Museum)
and
the
ever-popular
Julio
Romero
de
Torres
Museum
museum
devoted
to
the
CÃ³rdoban
artist
of
the
same
name
He
was
born
nearby
and
specialized
in
mildly
erotic
paintings
of
rather
beautiful
CÃ³rdobÃ©se
women
Eight
kilometers
(5
miles)
west
of
CÃ³rdoba
lies
the
ruins
of
the
intriguing
city
cum
palace
of
Medina
Azahara
It
was
commissioned
in
936
by
Abdel-Rahman
III
in
honor
of
his
favorite
concubine
Al
Zahra
(The
Flower)
and
its
design
was
so
grand
that
detailed
records
indicate
that
building
materials
were
brought
from
Constantinople
and
other
North
African
locations
Despite
such
auspicious
beginnings
it
had
short
life;
the
palace
was
razed
with
the
breakup
of
the
Caliphate
of
CÃ³rdoba
in
the
very
early
11th
century
Many
of
the
materials
were
subsequently
used
on
constructions
in
Sevilla
and
other
towns
For
nearly
900
years
it
was
left
in
ruins
and
not
until
1910
did
the
slow
work
of
excavation
begin
This
still
continues
but
reconstructed
royal
apartments
give
some
impression
of
the
original
magnificence
of
this
sumptuous
complex
of
baths
schools
gardens
and
stately
apartments
built
on
three
terraces
AlcalÃ¡
la
Real
The
road
from
CÃ³rdoba
to
Granada
is
in
many
sections
rather
dramatic;
you
pass
through
mountainous
scenery
dotted
with
small
white-walled
towns
often
crowned
with
castles
AlcalÃ¡
la
Real
as
it
was
known
in
Roman
times
was
Moorish
fortified
city
from
the
early
8th
century
and
remained
strategic
bastion
until
the
re-conquest
of
Granada
in
1492
after
which
further
Christian
monuments
were
added
The
Fortaleza
de
la
Mota
on
the
summit
at
1,033
(3,389
ft)
is
very
amazing
complex
combining
Moorish
and
Christian
influences
along
with
spectacular
views
particular
fascination
and
one
both
beautiful
and
gruesome
is
the
semi-ruined
church
whose
floor
has
been
partly
excavated
leaving
tombs
with
bones
and
skulls
exposed
Granada
The
Nasrid
dynasty
rose
to
power
in
Granada
just
as
the
fortunes
of
the
Spanish
Moors
were
beginning
to
wane
(see
page
15)
The
first
of
the
line
Mohammed
ben
Alhamar
established
his
capital
here
in
1232
after
Ferdinand
III
had
forced
him
from
JaÃ©n
Two
years
later
Moors
fleeing
from
the
newly
vanquished
Sevilla
swelled
the
population
which
had
already
been
augmented
by
refugees
from
CÃ³rdoba
Rather
than
grieve
for
the
homes
they
had
left
behind
the
industrious
Moors
set
about
making
Granada
the
grandest
city
of
Al
Andalus
Over
the
course
of
the
next
century
the
hilltop
palace
of
the
Alhambra
took
shape
Granada
was
the
last
of
the
great
Moorish
kingdoms
of
AndalucÃ­a
to
be
re-conquered
and
King
Boabdilâs
surrender
to
the
Catholic
Monarchs
in
January
1492
marked
the
end
of
the
Muslim
Empire
in
Spain
The
second
most
visited
monument
in
Spain
is
the
world-famous
Alhambra
(The
Red)
It
takes
its
name
from
the
red-brown
bricks
used
in
the
construction
of
its
outer
walls
which
rise
precipitously
above
the
deep
gorge
of
the
RÃ­o
Darro
Its
towers
strategically
command
superb
views
over
the
city
below
Within
the
walls
of
the
Alhambra
there
are
four
main
areas
to
explore
which
are
best
taken
in
the
following
order:
the
Alcazaba
(fortress)
the
Casa
Real
Vieja
(Old
Royal
Palace)
the
Casa
Real
Nueva
(new
Royal
Palace)
and
finally
the
Generalife
(summer
gardens)
Amazingly
this
complex
was
allowed
to
fall
into
almost
total
disrepair
over
the
centuries
and
was
used
as
barracks
for
Napoleonâs
troops
during
the
Wars
of
Independence
It
wasnât
until
1870
that
it
was
designated
National
Monument
The
Alcazaba
is
the
oldest
part
of
the
Alhambra
and
only
the
impressive
outer
walls
and
towers
survive
The
main
attraction
is
the
view
from
the
Torre
de
la
Vela
north
over
AlbaicÃ­n
and
Sacramonte
and
south
to
the
high
snow-capped
peaks
of
the
Sierra
Nevada
The
Palacio
Nazares
is
the
highlight
of
the
monument
It
was
the
magnificent
home
of
the
rulers
of
the
kingdom
of
Granada
Actually
series
of
palaces
not
just
one
each
palace
home
has
its
own
patios
fountains
pools
and
other
adornments
The
intricacy
delicacy
and
bountiful
beauty
of
the
design
creates
visual
impression
that
is
beyond
mere
words
The
SalÃ³n
de
Embajadores
(Hall
of
the
Ambassadors)
or
royal
audience
chamber
is
one
of
the
most
sumptuously
ornamented
rooms
in
the
Alhambra
Skirted
with
geometric
tiling
the
walls
and
roof
are
overlaid
with
delicately
shaped
plaster
stalactites
reaching
18
(60
ft)
to
the
carved
and
painted
wooden
ceiling
Verses
from
the
Koran
and
the
name
of
the
14th-century
monarch
Yusuf
are
woven
into
the
design
Through
the
tall
arched
windows
are
magnificent
views
of
AlbaicÃ­n
and
the
Darro
The
Sala
de
Abencerrajes
recalls
the
aristocratic
family
of
that
name
who
was
accused
of
disloyalty
and
collusion
with
the
Christians
by
Boabdil
The
king
invited
the
Abencerrajes
to
reception
in
this
very
room
and
massacred
all
36
of
the
unsuspecting
family
members
The
Patio
de
los
Leones
whose
name
derives
from
the
splashing
fountain
in
the
center
upheld
by
12
stone
lions
the
Torre
de
las
Damas
(Tower
of
the
Ladies)
and
the
old
bath
area
are
of
particular
interest
also
The
Casa
Real
Nueva
though
imposing
is
as
the
name
implies
relatively
new
and
architecturally
at
odds
with
the
more
ornate
older
palaces
some
of
which
were
destroyed
to
make
way
for
it
Commissioned
by
Carlos
in
1527
its
exterior
is
in
the
shape
of
square
with
surprisingly
elegant
two-story
circular
patio
on
the
inside
Considered
on
its
own
merits
the
building
must
be
regarded
as
fine
example
of
Renaissance
architecture
Two
museums
are
housed
inside
the
palace
The
first
the
Museo
Nacional
de
Arte
Hispano-MusulmÃ¡n
(Museum
of
Hispano-Moorish
Art)
displays
such
evocative
artifacts
as
the
throne
of
the
Nasrids
wooden
armchair
inlaid
with
silver
and
ivory
and
the
Alhambra
Vase
which
once
graced
the
Hall
of
the
Two
Sisters
The
second
known
as
the
Museo
de
Bellas
Artes
(Fine
Arts
Museum)
contains
collection
of
works
chronicling
the
development
of
the
school
of
Granada
between
the
16th
and
19th
centuries
The
Generalife
is
found
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
Alhambra
fortifications
on
the
neighboring
hillside
modest
summer
palace
it
is
surrounded
by
beautiful
terraced
gardens
where
oleander
and
roses
bloom
luxuriantly
and
delicate
fountains
and
cascades
play
among
the
neatly
clipped
cypress
hedges
Back
down
in
the
city
the
most
prominent
monument
is
the
exquisite
Capilla
Real
(Royal
Chapel)
Renaissance
chapel
that
serves
as
the
mausoleum
of
the
Catholic
Monarchs
The
effigies
of
Ferdinand
and
Isabella
lie
on
the
right-hand
side
of
the
chancel
with
those
of
their
daughter
Juana
La
Loca
and
her
husband
Felipe
El
Hermoso
on
the
slightly
higher
monument
on
the
left
Their
mortal
remains
have
been
interred
in
the
crypt
underneath
since
1521
after
ceremonial
transfer
of
their
remains
from
the
Alhambra
On
exhibition
in
the
sacristy
are
mementos
of
the
Catholic
Monarchs
including
Ferdinandâs
sword
and
Isabellaâs
scepter
and
crown
circle
of
gold
embellished
with
acanthus
scrolls
The
cathedral
next
door
is
large
and
imposing
few
steps
away
is
the
AlcaicerÃ­a
area
the
old
silk
market
of
the
Moors
These
days
it
is
colorful
collection
of
narrow
lanes
that
serve
as
center
for
the
sale
of
handicrafts
and
souvenirs
Not
far
away
is
the
Corral
del
CarbÃ³n
(House
of
Coal)
Dating
from
the
12th
century
it
is
the
oldest
Moorish
monument
in
the
city
and
is
now
center
for
typical
Granadino
arts
and
crafts
AlbaicÃ­n
the
old
Moorish
district
on
the
hill
opposite
the
Alhambra
has
maze
of
narrow
streets
and
staircases
surrounding
its
ancient
whitewashed
houses
and
enclosed
patio
gardens
Down
by
the
Darro
River
is
the
exquisite
Casa
de
Castril
dating
from
1539
and
home
of
the
Archaeological
Museum
as
well
as
nearby
11th-century
El
BaÃ±uelo
(Moorish
baths)
Farther
up
the
hill
is
the
Mirador
San
NicolÃ¡s
From
here
you
get
the
best
view
of
the
Alhambra
framed
by
the
snowcapped
Sierra
Nevada
mountains
in
the
backgroundÂ âÂ a
scene
replicated
on
many
postcards
High
to
the
right
of
AlbaicÃ­n
is
the
Gitano
(Gypsy)
area
of
Sacramonte
famous
for
its
caves
and
tablaos
(literally
stages)
where
gypsies
for
the
benefit
of
tourists
reenact
wedding
ceremonies
Tourists
though
should
be
wary
especially
at
night
as
this
is
not
the
safest
part
of
town
Lying
about
50
km
(32
miles)
east
of
Granada
on
the
road
to
Murcia
is
Guadix
particularly
unusual
city
in
that
many
of
its
inhabitants
are
troglodytes
In
the
Barrio
Santiago
there
are
streets
with
houses
that
have
their
own
small
front
yards
and
faÃ§ades
that
on
the
surface
make
them
indistinguishable
from
ordinary
homes
Look
closely
though
and
the
white
circular
chimneys
emanating
from
the
rocks
give
the
game
away
These
are
actually
caves
with
practical
use:
theyâre
cool
in
summer
and
warm
in
winter
There
is
plenty
else
of
interest
here
including
Moorish
castle
dating
from
the
10th
and
11th
centuries
late
16th-century
cathedral
and
many
important
palaces
houses
and
churches
Las
Alpujarras
This
is
remote
area
even
today
located
as
it
is
between
the
Sierra
Nevada
and
Sierra
de
la
Contraviesa
mountain
ranges
with
the
southern
slopes
of
the
latter
dropping
graciously
into
the
Mediterranean
Sea
Not
particularly
pretty
it
is
dotted
with
small
towns
and
villages
that
retain
many
appearances
of
lifestyle
long
since
departed
from
other
areas
The
way
of
life
here
in
the
early
20th
century
was
detailed
explicitly
by
Gerald
Brenan
in
his
book
South
from
Granada
In
fact
these
communities
fall
into
one
of
two
areas
depending
on
their
altitude
and
climate;
those
in
La
Alpujarra
Alta
(the
high
Alpujarra)
just
south
of
the
highest
peaks
in
the
Sierra
Nevada
and
those
in
La
Alpujarra
Baja
(the
low
Alpujarra)
in
the
Sierra
de
la
Contraviesa
Trevelez
considered
the
highest
village
in
Spain
is
famous
for
its
jamÃ³n
serrano
(dried
cured
ham)
and
LanjarÃ³n
is
familiar
throughout
Spain
as
the
name
on
the
red
green
and
white
label
on
bottles
of
water
originating
from
the
townâs
springs
Incidentally
that
same
water
runs
free
from
the
fuentes
(fountains)
of
many
villages
The
main
entrance
to
Las
Alpujarras
is
from
the
Granada
to
Motril
road;
the
same
road
along
which
the
defeated
Moors
traveled
on
their
way
to
exile
Even
today
there
is
place
on
that
road
just
12
km
(8
miles)
south
of
Granada
that
bears
the
sad
name
El
Puerto
del
Suspiro
del
Moro
(the
Pass
of
the
Sigh
of
the
Moor)
It
is
from
here
that
distant
Granada
finally
fades
from
view
and
the
land
takes
its
name
from
the
comments
made
by
the
defeated
King
Boabdilâs
mother
when
he
supposedly
wept
while
looking
back
at
the
city
Somewhat
cruelly
she
is
reported
to
have
told
him
âDonât
cry
like
woman
for
something
you
couldnât
defend
as
man.â
AndalucÃ­aâs
Natural
Parks
AndalucÃ­a
has
an
abundance
of
natural
parks
ranging
from
those
with
international
fame
to
more
obscure
remote
nature
preserves
Below
some
of
the
most
interesting
are
described
The
Sierra
Morena
This
nearly
480
km
(300-mile)
mountain
range
runs
from
the
mountains
of
southern
Portugal
in
the
west
to
the
border
of
the
Provincia
de
Murcia
in
the
east
effectively
forming
the
border
between
AndalucÃ­a
and
most
of
the
rest
of
Spain
Covering
an
area
of
524,000
hectares
(1,290,000
acres)
the
Sierra
Morena
encompasses
no
fewer
than
seven
natural
parks
namely:
the
Sierra
de
Aracena
Picos
de
Aroche;
the
Sierra
Norte
de
Sevilla;
the
Sierra
de
Hornachuelos;
the
Sierra
CardeÃ±a
Montoro;
the
Sierra
de
AndÃºjar;
DespeÃ±aperros;
and
the
Sierra
de
Cazorla
Segurla
Las
Villas
Each
of
these
parks
has
its
own
attributes
and
the
whole
area
is
stronghold
of
the
Spanish
Lynx
but
the
highest
peaks
and
the
most
dramatic
scenery
is
found
in
the
last
of
these
which
is
also
the
birthplace
of
the
great
Guadalquivir
River
DoÃ±ana
National
Park
This
is
probably
the
most
famous
park
in
Spain
It
holds
many
national
and
international
honors
and
is
even
listed
as
World
Heritage
Site
Consisting
of
86,208
hectares
(213,020
acres)
it
is
bordered
on
two
sides
by
the
Atlantic
Ocean
and
the
Guadalquivir
River
as
it
winds
its
way
down
from
Sevilla
to
reach
the
ocean
at
SanlÃºcar
de
Barrameda
In
fact
DoÃ±ana
is
the
last
great
lowland
wilderness
sanctuary
in
southern
Europe
and
has
three
distinct
ecosystems:
the
marismas
(salt
marshes)
matorral
(brushwood)
and
las
dunas
(sand
dunes)
Within
its
bounds
can
be
found
an
amazing
array
of
animal
bird
and
plant
life
but
what
you
see
is
very
much
dependent
upon
the
time
of
year
you
visit
and
even
then
can
be
very
hit
or
miss
The
only
way
to
really
see
the
park
is
on
tour
organized
by
Coop
Andaluz
Marismas
del
Rocio
whose
large-wheel
buses
depart
from
the
visitorsâ
center
at
El
Acebuche
Be
forewarned
though:
this
is
very
bumpy
rough
ride
and
definitely
not
advisable
for
those
with
artificial
hips
or
physical
handicaps
Lasting
about
four
hours
it
enters
the
sand
dunes
at
MatalascaÃ±as
and
the
first
part
of
the
trip
is
along
35
km
(nearly
20
miles)
of
unspoiled
beaches
The
only
human
residents
here
are
the
fishermen
living
in
what
look
like
very
ramshackle
huts
albeit
with
4-wheel
drive
vehicles
and
TV
antennas
on
display
The
vast
stretches
of
salt
marshes
are
fascinating
with
many
animals
living
along
the
edge
of
the
grassland
adjoining
them
The
huge
sand
dunes
perpetually
changing
make
for
surreal
sight
Laguna
de
Medina
Across
the
Guadalquivir
and
just
about
10
km
(6
miles)
east
of
Jerez
de
la
Frontera
is
this
small
lake
one
of
the
last
stops
in
Europe
for
birds
migrating
south
from
northern
and
central
Europe
to
Africa
at
the
end
of
August
In
periods
of
drought
it
is
attractive
to
birds
that
usually
reside
at
DoÃ±ana
and
around
50
species
have
been
observed
here
Grazalema
short
distance
to
the
east
of
Laguna
de
Medina
is
the
mainly
mountain
wilderness
of
the
natural
park
of
Grazalema
Its
51,695
hectares
(127,740
acres)
are
home
to
three
species
of
eagles
and
numerous
other
birds
mammals
and
reptiles
Interestingly
the
mountains
here
which
range
between
1,000
and
1,700
meters
(3,300
and
5,600
ft)
are
the
first
stop
for
clouds
arriving
from
the
Atlantic
giving
the
area
the
greatest
annual
rainfall
in
Spain
This
allows
fine
array
of
flora
to
thrive
Of
particular
note
is
the
rare
abies
pinsapo
(Spanish
fir
tree)
El
Torcal
de
Antequera
and
the
Fuente
de
Piedra
Just
south
of
the
city
of
Antequera
is
one
of
the
more
famous
geological
formations
in
Spain
The
limestone
mountains
of
the
El
Torcal
de
Antequera
have
eroded
to
form
some
of
the
most
unusual
shapes
seen
anywhere
In
fact
these
formations
so
resemble
modern
sculptures
that
they
have
been
assigned
comical
names
Just
north
of
Antequera
droughts
notwithstanding
is
the
Fuente
de
Piedra
AndalucÃ­aâs
largest
lake
with
surface
area
that
can
reach
1,384
hectares
(3,420
acres)
Each
spring
provided
that
weather
conditions
are
favorable
it
becomes
home
to
flamingos
In
fact
it
is
the
only
inland
breeding
area
in
Europe
for
this
colorful
species
Springtime
means
the
islet
of
La
Colonia
becomes
one
of
the
most
crowded
bird
habitats
anywhere
(more
than
16,000
breeding
pairs
were
identified
in
1996)
Over
150
species
of
birds
have
been
counted
on
the
lake
or
in
surrounding
areas
Sierra
Nevada
Las
Alpujarras
This
recently
created
national
park
which
begins
near
Granada
has
the
distinction
of
having
the
highest
peak
on
the
Spanish
mainland
(MulhacÃ©n
is
3,482
meters
(11,420
ft)
tall)
and
wide
diversity
of
flora
made
possible
by
the
nearby
Mediterranean
Biosphere
Reserve
It
also
has
the
highest
road
in
Europe
Along
it
is
the
Solynieve
(literally
Sun
and
Snow)
skiing
resort
accessible
year-round
at
some
2,500
(8,000
ft)
and
the
more
elevated
Pico
Veleta
(the
Weathercock)
at
3,398
(11,148
ft)
which
can
only
be
reached
during
few
short
weeks
in
summer

Tenerife
is
not
only
the
largest
of
the
Canaries
geographically
it
also
offers
the
tourist
more
sights
more
attractions
more
towns
and
cities
to
explore
and
more
contrasts
than
any
of
the
other
islands
Where
else
can
you
look
around
banana
plantation
and
then
take
short
drive
half-way
up
mountain
for
snowball
fight?
Tenerife
has
been
welcoming
visitors
from
cold
northern
climes
since
the
19th
century
However
the
focus
has
changed
from
the
cloudy
green
north
coast
where
Puerto
de
la
Cruz
was
once
the
favorite
resort
(it
is
still
enormously
popular)
to
the
hot
dry
arid
south
Santa
Cruz
de
Tenerife
The
capital
of
Tenerife
and
the
administrative
center
for
the
westerly
Canaries
Santa
Cruz
is
not
city
in
which
tourists
spend
great
deal
of
time
The
main
square
is
the
Plaza
de
EspaÃ±a
in
the
middle
of
which
stands
four-sided
cross
memorial
to
the
dead
of
the
Spanish
Civil
War
The
huge
drab
gray
building
adjacent
to
the
Plaza
is
the
Cabildo
Insular
(local
government
headquarters)
which
also
houses
the
tourist
office
and
the
Museo
ArqueolÃ³gico
with
important
exhibits
illustrating
the
life
and
death
rituals
of
Guanche
society
(see
page
13)
The
museum
is
open
TuesdayâSunday
10amâ8pm
and
the
entrance
fee
is
mere
400
pesetas
(free
on
Sundays)
Back
on
the
seafront
discover
the
Iglesia
Matriz
de
la
ConcepciÃ³n
(Church
of
the
Immaculate
Conception)
Dating
from
the
early
16th
century
this
is
the
townâs
most
important
historical
building
and
contains
several
interesting
relics
including
Nelsonâs
faded
battle
flag
Puerto
de
la
Cruz
Puerto
as
this
town
is
often
abbreviated
to
has
neither
good
beaches
nor
the
abundant
sunshine
of
the
south
yet
for
many
travelers
it
is
the
most
complete
resort
on
the
island
It
has
been
attracting
convalescing
northern
Europeans
for
over
century
and
it
maintains
much
of
its
colonial
grandeur
The
seafront
promenade
has
been
quite
heavily
commercialized
but
not
at
all
spoiled
and
the
atmosphere
is
always
lively
without
being
boisterous
The
main
square
Plaza
de
Charco
is
the
hub
of
both
tourist
and
local
life
and
its
numerous
cafÃ©s
restaurants
and
shops
are
busy
at
all
hours
Just
off
the
square
the
old
town
around
the
Puerto
Pesquero
is
remarkably
oblivious
to
change
Among
the
narrow
streets
with
faded
wooden
balconies
and
carved
doors
are
the
Casa
de
Miranda
now
crafts
shop
and
restaurant
and
oldest
of
all
the
Casa
de
la
Real
Aduana
(Customs
House)
built
in
1620
facing
the
tiny
port
The
problem
of
Puertoâs
lack
of
decent
beach
was
brilliantly
addressed
by
the
late
CÃ©sar
Manrique
who
designed
Lago
MartiÃ¡nez
which
is
open
daily
9:45am
to
5pm
This
3-hectare
(8-acre)
complex
of
tropical
lagoons
cascading
fountains
and
sunbathing
terraces
is
cleverly
landscaped
with
lush
palms
and
black-and-white
volcanic
rocks
to
fit
perfectly
into
the
seafront
where
the
surf
crashes
spectacularly
against
the
rocks
There
are
numerous
places
on
Tenerife
competing
for
the
attention
of
tourists
but
there
is
one
just
to
the
west
of
Puerto
that
absolutely
should
not
be
missed
Loro
Parque;
(open
daily
8:30amâ5pm
admission:
2,900
ptas
r17.43)
has
the
worldâs
largest
collection
of
parrotsÂ âÂ more
than
300
species
and
subspecies
It
is
also
home
to
the
most
eclectic
array
of
animals
including
gorillas
chimpanzees
tigers
jaguars
alligators
sea-lions
dolphins
and
numerous
other
creatures
that
are
exhibited
in
carefully
and
creatively
designed
spaces
Look
also
for
the
underwater
world
of
the
aquarium
and
shark
tunnel
and
the
newest
and
undoubtedly
most
inventive
display
The
Planet
Penguin
the
largest
Penguinarium
in
the
world
covers
3,900
square
(nearly
acre)
and
has
been
created
as
natural
habitat
for
these
engaging
creatures
The
temperature
of
their
iceberg
is
kept
at
between
-2Âº
and
2Âº
(28Âºâ36Âº
F)
with
12
tons
of
artificial
snow
falling
on
it
daily
through
openings
in
the
roof
The
surrounding
sea
is
chilled
to
10Âº
(50Âº
F)
Visitors
are
conveyed
around
on
moving
walkway
that
allows
the
King
Gentoo
and
Rockhopper
penguins
to
be
seen
cavorting
on
land
and
in
the
water
Look
also
for
the
dolphin
sea
lion
and
parrot
shows
and
animal
feedings
Just
north
of
Puerto
on
the
road
to
La
Orotavo
there
are
two
places
both
open
daily
9amâ6pm
that
have
similar
themes
but
exhibit
them
in
rather
different
ways
The
oldest
of
these
and
closest
to
town
is
undoubtedly
the
JardÃ­n
BotÃ¡nico
(Botanical
Garden)
founded
by
royal
decree
in
1788
Covering
some
2.5
hectares
(6
acres)
it
has
palms
of
every
variety
and
the
centerpiece
is
huge
South
American
fig
tree
whose
enormous
branches
and
roots
have
become
intertwined
into
one
great
tree
house
Further
on
Bananera
El
Guanche
provides
fascinating
insight
into
how
Canarian
banana
plantation
operates
By

Continue
on
up
Calle

to
the
Casas

Balcones
(Houses
of
the
Balconies)
The
balconies
in
question
are
inside
the

courtyard
and
are
some
of
the
finest
examples
of
their
kind
This
splendid
17th-century
mansion
and
the
Casa

(built
in
1590)
opposite
are
now
shops
dedicated
to

La

is
Tenerifeâs
second
largest
town
and
known
as
the
ecclesiastic
and
cultural
capital
of
the
island
However
it
is
not
well-visited
by
tourists
Start
at
the
Plaza
del
Adelantado
and
short
way
along
Calle
Obispo
Rey
Redondo
is
the
cathedral
of
La
Laguna
with
its
landmark
twin
bell
towers
It
is
surprisingly
modern
structure
in
spite
of
its
design
consecrated
in
1913
over
400
years
after
the
city
was
founded
Continue
on
the
same
street
to
the
townâs
oldest
church
Iglesia
de
Nuestra
SeÃ±ora
de
la
ConcepciÃ³n
(Church
of
the
Immaculate
Conception)
built
in
1497
Its
seven-story
belfry
and
watchtower
were
added
two
centuries
later
The
interior
is
outstanding
with
exquisite
timber
carvings
on
the
ceiling
and
pulpit
and
an
enormous
Baroque
altarpiece
with
Flemish
panels
West
of
Puerto
full
dayâs
outing
from
Puerto
de
la
Cruz
along
the
unspoiled
north
and
west
coasts
covers
some
of
the
islandâs
most
spectacular
sights
and
scenery
Sleepy
Icod
de
Los
Vinos
is
the
home
of
the
botanical
freak
that
is
Drago
Milenario
1,000-year-old
Dragon
Tree
Continue
west
on
the
coast
road
from
Icod
to
Garachico
and
after
km
(3.7
miles)
the
tortuous
descent
begins
There
are
marvelous
views
looking
directly
down
onto
this
compact
little
town
of
6,000
inhabitants
set
on
small
peninsula
with
the
waves
crashing
all
around
The
peninsula
is
actually
formed
from
the
volcanic
debris
that
was
deposited
following
disastrous
eruption
in
1706
when
most
of
the
town
and
its
inhabitants
were
destroyed
The
best
place
to
survey
the
aftermath
of
the
petrified
lava
is
from
the
beautifully
preserved
16th-century
Castillo
de
San
Miguel
lucky
survivor
this
fortress
(note
the
heraldic
arms
above
the
doorway)
is
now
devoted
to
handicraft
sales
There
is
no
beach
to
speak
of
here
but
very
cleverly
designed
set
of
pools
built
into
the
rocks
more
than
compensates
Despite
the
destruction
Garachico
is
little
gem
Neat
houses
boasting
typically
attractive
Canarian
balconies
line
cobbled
streets
and
old
churches
adorn
pretty
squares
Unmissable
also
is
the
large
uninhabited
rock
out
in
the
bay
and
it
has
managed
to
gain
for
itself
place
in
the
spiritual
life
of
Garachico
Without
patron
saint
of
its
own
the
town
has
elevated
the
rock
to
be
its
saint!
Farther
along
the
coast
road
km
(5
miles)
past
Buenavista
del
Norte
lies
the
most
westerly
point
on
Tenerife
the
Punta
de
Teno
From
here
there
are
panoramic
views
across
to
La
Gomera
and
looking
south
to
the
massive
cliffs
of
Los
Gigantes
Turn
back
to
Buenavista
and
take
marked
turn
inland
to
Masca
Be
warned
though
this
is
absolutely
not
drive
to
be
undertaken
by
inexperienced
or
nervous
drivers
Initially
the
road
although
ascending
through
the
arable
mountainside
is
no
problem;
but
this
soon
changes
once
the
entrance
to
the
vertiginous
valley
is
reached
One
glance
at
the
narrow
steeply
twisting
road
on
either
side
will
be
enough
to
realize
why
up
to
only
few
years
ago
the
picturesque
tiny
village
of
Masca
could
only
be
reached
on
the
back
of
donkey
All
around
is
some
of
the
most
dramatic
scenery
on
the
island
However
if
you
are
driving
you
wonât
have
any
time
to
savor
it
The
road
clings
precariously
to
the
side
of
lush
green
mountains
cleft
by
deep
dark
ravines
and
often
zig-zags
on
itself
in
the
tightest
of
hairpin
bends
And
it
is
far
from
unknown
to
have
to
reverse
back
down
and
around
these
bends
allowing
other
vehicles
to
pass
stop
at
Masca
is
not
just
pleasure
but
also
relief
Relax
at
one
of
the
restaurants
down
from
the
road
and
enjoy
the
stupendous
scenery
before
continuing
south
on
an
equally
difficult
drive
to
rejoin
the
main
road
at
Santiago
del
Teide
little
farther
south
turn
off
towards
Puerto
de
Santiago
then
walk
out
to
the
edge
of
the
marina
jetty
to
get
the
best
view
of
the
enormous
sheer
cliffs
up
to
800
(2,625
ft)
high
known
appropriately
as
Los
Gigantes
(The
Giants)
The
Central
Area
There
are
several
approaches
to
Las
CaÃ±adas
National
Park
and
Mount
Teide
The
park
is
well
sign-posted
from
the
road
via
La
Orotava
but
if
you
are
coming
from
the
north
then
the
most
picturesque
route
is
via
La
Esperanza
The
small
town
soon
gives
way
to
lush
forest
of
giant
pines
and
eucalyptus
trees
Four
km
(21â2
miles)
south
at
Las
RaÃ­ces
is
where
Franco
met
with
his
co-conspirators
in
1936
(see
page
20)
An
obelisk
in
the
forest
commemorates
the
event
As
the
road
gains
altitude
and
temperatures
fall
the
views
become
ever
more
spectacular
The
Mirador
Pico
de
las
Flores
looks
out
over
to
the
southeast
and
the
Mirador
de
OrtuÃ±o
offers
panorama
of
the
northern
coast
Highest
of
all
at
over
2,000
(6,562
ft)
Mirador
las
Cumbres
reveals
Teide
in
all
her
glory
The
entrance
to
the
National
Park
is
El
Portillo
de
las
CaÃ±adas
where
there
is
visitor
center
(open
daily
9amâ4pm)
If
you
wish
to
walk
in
the
park
pick
up
leaflet
or
ask
for
information
about
the
daily
guided
walks
Note
that
during
winter
the
environment
can
become
quite
harsh
and
you
should
never
undertake
walks
without
consulting
staff
at
the
visitor
center
first
At
this
point
it
is
quite
likely
that
you
will
be
in
the
clouds;
temperatures
are
very
low
and
in
winter
there
may
well
be
snow
on
the
ground
The
landscape
becomes
very
lunar-like;
it
was
around
here
that
some
of
the
filming
for
Planet
of
the
Apes
took
place
The
ascent
to
the
top
of
Mount
Teide
can
be
made
by
climbing
or
by
the
new
cable
car
(telefÃ©rico)
an
eight-minute
ride
(open
daily
9amâ4pm
admission:
2,500
ptas
r15.03)
Most
visitors
choose
the
cable
car
but
itâs
worth
noting
that
even
after
leaving
the
cable
car
it
is
still
good
climb
to
the
summit
at
3,717
(12,195
ft)
However
if
you
really
want
to
venture
that
far
you
have
to
go
in
person
and
with
photocopy
of
your
passport
to
the
Office
of
the
Parque
Nacional
del
Teide
(Calle
Emilio
Calzadilla
5
38002
Santa
Cruz
de
Tenerife)
Even
then
there
is
daily
limit
of
just
50
people
for
conservation
sake
allowed
up
the
last
200
(219
yards)
to
the
summit
Once
there
you
should
be
able
to
count
off
all
the
other
Canary
Islands
and
on
good
day
see
North
Africa
Impressive
as
Teide
is
it
is
basically
no
more
than
peak
on
the
edge
of
giant
volcano
which
long
ago
erupted
or
imploded
Left
behind
is
the
vast
Caldera
(volcanic
crater)
which
is
most
apparent
from
the
area
known
as
Los
Roques
Los
Roques
are
group
of
giant
flamboyantly
shaped
lumps
of
volcanic
rock
rising
out
of
the
crater;
often
visited
and
photographed
The
East
and
South
Coast
Candelaria
is
town
with
deep
religious
roots
Legend
has
it
that
well
before
Christianity
came
to
the
Canaries
an
image
of
the
Virgin
was
washed
ashore
here
and
worshipped
by
the
Guanches
who
were
quite
oblivious
to
its
Christian
significance
The
Spaniards
later
built
church
dedicated
to
the
statue
Sadly
both
the
statue
and
the
church
were
destroyed
in
1826
when
tidal
wave
reclaimed
the
Virgin
The
present
over-sized
basilica
was
built
soon
afterwards
The
splendid
new
statue
of
Nuestra
SeÃ±ora
de
la
Candelaria
the
patron
saint
of
the
Canary
Islands
is
the
object
of
major
pilgrimage
in
mid-August
The
Guanches
are
not
forgotten
either:
ten
chieftains
stand
guard
in
row
with
their
backs
to
the
Atlantic
These
idealized
cavemen
are
truly
noble
savages
Just
south
and
inland
from
Candelaria
is
GÃ¼Ã­mar
which
with
the
exception
of
one
curiosity
is
easily
overlooked
However
those
with
an
interest
in
the
history
of
these
islands
will
be
intrigued
by
the
PirÃ¡mides
de
GÃ¼Ã­mar
<www.fredolsen.es/piramides>
The
step
pyramids
(also
known
as
the
Chacona
pyramids)
here
didnât
become
evident
until
the
early
1990s
They
came
to
the
notice
of
the
Norwegian
anthropologist
Thor
Heyerdahl
internationally
acclaimed
for
his
transoceanic
crossings
with
prehistoric
vessels
and
theories
about
human
migration
After
studying
photos
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
Chacona
pyramids
were
similar
in
principal
to
those
in
the
Old
and
New
worlds
Subsequently
he
took
personal
interest
and
began
to
relate
their
existence
to
pre-Hispanic
civilizations
that
either
lived
or
visited
the
island
Today
on
view
are
not
only
the
pyramids
themselves
but
models
of
Heyerdahlâs
vessels
video
detailing
his
summaries
and
transoceanic
crossings
and
various
other
interesting
audio-visual
displays
There
is
little
else
of
interest
after
here
until
you
reach
the
south
of
the
island
The
most
popular
tourist
destinations
in
Tenerife
are
the
adjacent
resorts
of
Los
Cristianos
and
Playa
de
las
AmÃ©ricas
Los
Cristianos
used
to
be
small
fishing
port
with
quiet
little
beach
It
now
plays
host
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
mainly
British
and
fewer
German
vacationers
each
year
and
its
small
beach
inside
the
port
is
woefully
inadequate
Traces
of
the
old
town
can
still
be
found
around
the
port
though
it
is
difficult
to
locate
anything
but
British
or
German
bars
and
restaurants
along
the
crowded
beachfront
Playa
de
las
AmÃ©ricas
was
born
in
the
1970s
and
has
quickly
developed
from
bare
shoreline
to
the
high-rise
high-energy
highly
packaged
resort
it
is
today
Here
the
beachside
bars
are
not
Spanish
nor
even
international:
they
are
mainly
English
In
the
evenings
of
course
the
hundreds
of
English
bars
compete
with
each
other
some
even
advertising
which
British
beers
they
sell
on
local
English
radio
stations
for
this
lucrative
and
ever
thirsty
market
Discos
too
are
ever
popular
with
the
younger
crowd
but
when
they
spill
out
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
good-natured
boisterousness
can
sometimes
result
in
rowdiness
Beware
also
of
the
dangers
of
muggings
On
the
other
side
of
Playa
de
las
AmÃ©ricas
but
with
border
as
indistinguishable
as
that
with
Los
Cristianos
is
the
newly
popular
area
of
Costa
Adeje
but
here
it
really
is
rather
different
The
wall-to-wall
hotels
fast
food
places
and
other
such
popular
activities
with
the
English
and
Germans
gives
way
to
much
more
elegant
spacious
cleverly
designed
resort
hotels
offering
such
extensive
facilities
that
you
donât
even
have
to
leave
the
propertyÂ âÂ creating
much
more
agreeable
ambiance
than
that
of
its
two
near
neighbors
There
is
of
course
no
shortage
of
entertainment
facilities
and
Puerto
de
ColÃ³n
has
become
not
just
favorite
place
to
wander
around
and
watch
the
boats
but
center
for
some
really
neat
and
unusual

El
Hierro
Area:
297
sq
km
(107
sq
miles)
Population:
8,000
El
Hierro
has
hardly
any
tourist
facilities
no
natural
spectacles
and
no
good
beaches
but
it
is
pretty
quiet
and
totally
unspoiled
More
than
enough
attributes
for
many
to
pay
visit
However
the
configuration
of
the
roads
makes
exploration
frustrating
affair
as
it
is
impossible
to
make
circular
tour
as
roads
just
do
not
join
up
In
the
southwest
corner
of
the
archipelago
El
Hierro
was
at
one
time
considered
to
be
the
end
of
the
known
world
and
for
that
reason
it
was
used
as
the
zero
meridian
which
has
long
since
relocated
to
Greenwich
Valverde
The
only
Canaries
capital
located
inland
Valverde
was
built
high
on
mountainside
to
protect
it
from
pirate
raids
and
is
very
small
town
with
only
parador
and
few
other
places
offering
tourist
accommodation
The
Rest
of
the
Island
From
Valverde
follow
the
road
to
Isora
neat
little
village
of
well-tended
gardens
There
are
three
miradors
to
enjoy
on
the
road
to
El
Pinar
The
name
comes
from
the
pinewood
forests
that
in
places
make
up
gentle
rolling
landscape
of
fields
and
trees
reminiscent
of
northern
Europe
As
the
road
descends
south
the
greenery
eventually
peters
out
into
volcanic
badlands
and
at
the
tip
of
the
island
is
the
fishing
port
of
La
Restinga
The
switchback
road
down
to
Frontera
passes
fertile
cultivated
fields
and
the
occasional
disused
lagar
(winepress)
The
bell
tower
of
the
church
here
is
something
of
an
oddity
being
divorced
from
its
body
and
set
on
top
of
small
hill
next
to
it
From
distance
the
tiny
tower
set
against
the
massive
cliff
side
seems
terribly
remote
but
as
you
approach
it
the
illusion
disappears
and
the
main
road
passes
within
feet
of
the
church
and
tower
The
cliffs
here
and
all
along
the
stretch
of
north
coast
known
as
El
Golfo
were
once
actually
part
of
an
immense
volcanic
crater
However
some
50,000
years
ago
one
side
of
it
slid
violently
into
the
sea
leaving
behind
gigantic
bay
with
semi-circumference
of
25
km
(15.5
miles)
and
cliffs
of
up
to
1,000
(3,280
ft)
Although
the
last
eruption
on
the
island
was
over
200
years
ago
El
Hierro
actually
has
the
highest
density
of
volcanoes
in
the
archipelago
There
are
over
500
cones
on
the
surface
with
an
additional
300
covered
by
lava
flows
The
road
west
leads
to
the
village
of
Sabinosa
and
just
south
of
here
though
only
accessible
by
long
journey
is
the
Ermita
de
los
Reyes
and
the
forest
of
El
Sabinal
The
forest
is
made
up
of
juniper
trees
(sabinosas)
which
are
incredibly
and
grotesquely
twisted
stunted
gnarled
and
in
some
cases
almost
bent
double
by
the
wind
The
Mirador
de
la
PeÃ±a
km
(5
miles)
west
of
Valverde
is
the
newest
the
most
impressive
and
arguably
the
only
real
tourist
attraction
on
the
island
Those
familiar
with
the
work
of
CÃ©sar
Manrique
(see
page
30)
will
not
need
an
introduction
The
views
are
marvelous
and
the

is
one
of
the
best
on

dramatic
and
rugged
mountainous
island
It
has
coastline
that
is
dominated
by
dramatic
cliffsÂ âÂ there
are
very
few
beaches
and
the
interior
is
full
of
vertiginous
mostly
verdant
valleys
that
are
often
lined
with
narrow
fields
stepped
into
the
sides
of
the
mountains
For
extra
effect
these
valleys
are
more
often
than
not
covered
by
ceiling
of
cloud
whisked
in
by
the
trade
winds
which
seem
to
perpetually
hang
over
the
island
In
the
center
there
is
the
unusually
dense
growth
of
trees
and
fauna
in
what
is
the
Parque
Nacional
Garajonay
(open
TuesdayâSunday
9:30amâ4:30pm)
Less
than
20
km
(121â2
miles)
from
north
to
south
this
amazing
island
has
been
declared
Property
of
Humanity
by
UNESCO
In
fact
third
of
the
island
12,450
hectares
(30,774
acres)
has
been
designated
into
seventeen
protected
areas
Such
terrain
though
makes
for
difficulty
in
getting
around
and
even
the
Romans
had
they
ventured
this
way
would
have
found
their
legendary
ability
to
build
straight
roads
put
to
an
impossible
test
In
fact
almost
nowhere
on
the
island
will
you
find
straight
stretch
of
road
everywhere
you
go
the
roads
twist
and
turn
continually
often
turning
back
on
themselves
in
hairpin
bends
Making
driving
even
more
complicated
is
the
fact
that
the
roads
although
improving
are
often
of
poor
quality
and
the
directional
signs
leave
much
to
be
desired
Just
40
minutes
away
from
Tenerife
La
Gomera
nevertheless
remains
unspoiled
and
authentic
with
its
steep
green
terraced
hills
and
tranquil
valleys
San
SebastiÃ¡n
Capital
and
main
port
of
the
island
this
small
town
will
always
be
important
as
the
place
where
Columbus
took
leave
of
the
known
world
on
September
1492
on
the
voyage
which
revealed
the
New
World
The
Columbiana
starts
in
the
main
square
pavement
mosaic
shows
the
route
of
Columbusâs
voyage
and
next
to
the
large
tree
is
the
Casa
de
Aduana
(the
old
Customs
House)
According
to
folklore
Columbus
drew
water
from
the
well
here
took
it
to
the
New
World
and
used
it
to
baptize
America
Leading
off
the
square
the
Calle
del
Medio
is
the
only
street
of
any
consequence
in
town
and
features
more
connections
with
the
great
navigator
The
Iglesia
de
la
AsunciÃ³n
built
between
1490â1510
looks
and
feels
so
old
that
you
can
easily
imagine
Columbus
praying
in
dark
recessÂ âÂ as
plaque
here
tells
us
he
did
in
1492
little
way
up
the
street
is
the
modest
Casa
Columbiana/Casa
de
ColÃ³n
which
is
supposedly
where
he
stayed
in
La
Gomera
The
North
The
road
from
San
SebastiÃ¡n
climbs
steeply
and
the
views
soon
become
quite
dizzying
The
highest
peak
on
La
Gomera
Alto
de
Garajonay
is
1,487
(4,878
ft)Â âÂ this
is
no
great
height
by
Canaries
standards
yet
the
island
often
gives
the
impression
of
being
fearsome
maze
of
eerie
crags
The
small
town
of
Hermigua
is
the
largest
on
the
island
after
San
SebastiÃ¡n
Stop
at
the
crafts
center
of
Los
Telares
to
take
look
down
into
its
green
and
fertile
valley
and
ask
if
you
can
try
the
local
liqueur
mistela
whilst
watching
women
making
blankets
and
rugs
on
their
antique
looms
After
this
there
are
fine
views
of
the
impressive
cliffs
and
Agulo
is
pleasant
small
town
whose
main
feature
is
the
domed
Iglesia
San
Marco
which
adjoins
monumental
laurel
tree
in
the
plaza
This
church
was
originally
mosque
during
brief
period
of
Moorish
occupation
in
the
17th
century
turn
inland
just
before
the
village
of
Las
Rosas
is
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
Garajonay
National
Park
declared
World
Heritage
Site
by
UNESCO
The
Centro
de
InterpretaciÃ³n
(information
center);
has
small
museum
displays
and
gardens
The
road
then
continues
through
the
4,000-hectare
(9,884-acre)
park
to
the
La
Laguna
Grande
restaurant
hospitable
rough-and-ready
sort
of
place
which
is
very
popular
with
walkers
Unlike
the
national
parks
at
the
peaks
of
many
of
the
Canary
Islands
there
are
no
views
from
here
aside
from
at
Garajonay
itself
and
an
almost
perpetual
thick
mist
clings
to
the
ancient
moss-covered
trees
As
there
is
little
rainfall
on
La
Gomera
this
mist
spawned
by
the
mystical
trade
winds
assumes
great
ecological
importance
having
given
life
to
this
sub-tropical
forest
The
South
The
main
road
from
San
SebastiÃ¡n
leads
past
three
mighty
volcanic
plugs
which
are
nicknamed
âthe
Chinese
Hat,â
âthe
Lion,â
and
âthe
Face
of
Christâ
after
their
respective
outlines
The
windy
pass
of
Degollada
de
Peraza
offers
spectacular
views
to
both
the
north
and
the
south
and
the
road
splits
here
Rather
than
continue
on
to
Garajonay
turn
left
on
an
equally
windy
road
that
leads
to
Playa
Santiago
Besides
San
SebastiÃ¡n
this
is
one
of
the
few
waterside
communities
on
the
island
The
unpretentious
little
port
and
beach
is
almost
totally
unspoiled
by
any
outward
signs
of
tourism
even
though
the
cliffs
immediately
to
its
east
are
home
to
the
JardÃ­n
Tecina
really
special
self-contained
resort
Continue
inland
passing
the
new
airport
and
at
Igualero
turn
west
onto
the
minor
road
that
crosses
to
Las
Hayas
Stop
in
the
small
village
of
El
Cercado
where
almost
next
door
to
each
other
there
are
the
Rufina
and
Malria
two
small
stores
where
the
owners
make
ceramic
goods
in
the
traditional
manner
Watch
as
little
old
ladies
fashion
the
clay
and
then
be
tempted
to
purchase
the
end
results
or
other
goods
and
antiques
that
are
on
sale
Be
surprised
also
by
the
prices;
they
are
nearly
as
steep
as
the
islandâs
cliffs
and
valleys!
From
Las
Hayas
continue
along
to
the
main
road
at
Arure
where
immediately
after
turning
left
there
is
small
bodega
selling
wines
not
only
from
La
Gomera
but
from
throughout
the
Canary
Islands
too
La
Gomera
actually
has
about
300
hectares
(741.3
acres)
of
vineyards
mostly
cultivated
on
uneven
land
with
steep
slopes
and
small
terraces
stop
at
the
highest
point
of
this
road
is
must:
The
views
from
the
combined
mirador/restaurant
Escuela
CÃ©sar
Manrique
of
the
Valle
Gran
Rey
(the
multi-tiered
valley
not
the
town
of
the
same
name)
below
are
stupendous
The
small
town
of
Valle
Gran
Rey
even
has
beach
of
some
size
albeit
of
black
sand
and
accompanying
restaurants
Follow
the
road
back
through
the
valley
continue
on
past
Arure
and
then
make
right
at
the
T-junction
with
the
other
main
road
and
this
leads
all
the
way
back
to
San
SebastiÃ¡n
de
La
Gomera
passing
La
Laguna
Grande
and
the
entrance
to
Garajonay
along
the
way
La
Palma
Area:
725
sq
km
(280
sq
miles)Â âÂ the
fifth
largest
island
Population:
81,500
La
Palma
the
most
northwesterly
of
the
Canaries
has
two
nicknamesÂ âÂ La
Isla
Bonita
(the
beautiful
island)
and
La
Isla
Verde
(the
green
island)
and
both
are
suitable
Beautiful
it
certainly
is
and
very
green
too
Not
only
that
but
its
statistics
are
very
impressive
The
highest
peak
Roque
de
los
Muchachos
rises
2,423
(7,950
ft)
above
sea
level
making
it
the
steepest
island
in
the
world
in
relation
to
its
total
area
It
is
also
the
only
one
of
the
Canary
Islands
to
have
even
very
small
streams
Santa
Cruz
de
la
Palma
The
island
capital
is
an
appealing
townÂ âÂ clean
and
bright
with
traditional
and
modern
architecture
side-by-side
creating
much
charm
especially
when
compared
with
many
of
the
other
islandsâ
rather
bland
capitals
The
importance
of
the
town
is
such
that
during
the
Renaissance
era
it
was
the
third
most
important
port
of
the
Spanish
Empire
after
Sevilla
and
Antwerp
The
heart
of
the
town
is
the
small
triangular
Plaza
de
EspaÃ±a
set
couple
of
streets
in
from
the
seafront
on
the
Calle
Real
On
one
side
of
the
triangle
is
the
Iglesia
Matriz
de
El
Salvador
(Church
of
the
Saviour)
built
in
1503
The
ceiling
of
this
big
stone
church
is
made
of
tea
(heart
of
pine)
and
is
fine
example
of
the
Mudejar
(Muslim
under
Christian
rule)
style
of
intricate
wooden
paneling
Next
to
the
church
are
some
splendid
examples
of
18th
century
colonial-style
mansions
notably
the
Casa
Monte
Verde
dating
from
1618
but
having
been
rebuilt
in
1922â1923
The
longest
side
of
the
triangle
is
taken
up
by
the
ayuntamiento
(Town
Hall)
built
between
1559
and
1567
with
stone
brought
from
La
Gomera;
this
is
considered
the
most
important
Renaissance
building
in
the
Canary
Islands
While
the
arches
are
Italian
Renaissance
the
interior
(which
you
are
free
to
inspect)
is
Spanish
colonial
with
formidable
carved
wooden
ceilings
and
doors
and
ceremonial
staircase
with
frescoes
painted
by
M
CossÃ­o
around
1950
The
Calle
Real
is
delightful
street
in
which
to
stroll
and
enjoy
the
atmosphere
At
its
southern
end
it
takes
on
the
improbable
title
of
Calle
OâDaly
named
after
an
Irish
banana
merchant
who
settled
on
the
island
Look
also
on
the
parallel
Avenida
Maritimo
at
the
wonderfully
charming
row
of
old
houses
known
as
the
Casas
de
los
Balcones
Houses
with
balconies
built
in
the
19th
century
they
have
become
symbolic
of
Santa
Cruz
Colorful
and
characteristic
and
with
Portuguese
influence
they
have
overhanging
balconies
and
those
facing
the
sea
were
once
used
as
lookout
posts
Due
to
the
steep
dorsal
shape
of
the
island
there
are
only
two
main
island
routes
to
follow:
the
loop
south
of
the
Caldera
de
Taburiente
or
the
loop
north
of
it
The
southern
route
is
the
more
interesting
of
the
two
The
Southern
Loop
Heading
west
from
Santa
Cruz
the
first
stop
of
interest
is
Las
Nieves
village
built
on
the
mountainside
The
first
indication
of
it
is
roadside
bar
followed
by
the
17th-century
Santuario
de
Nuestra
SeÃ±ora
de
las
Nieves
(Sanctuary
of
Our
Lady
of
the
Snows)
This
holds
the
venerated
14th-century
terracotta
image
of
the
Virgen
de
las
Nieves
which
relates
to
an
ancient
miracle
when
the
Virgin
appeared
in
Rome
during
August
snow
Every
five
years
the
image
is
carried
to
Santa
Cruz
in
procession
known
as
La
Bajada
de
la
Virgen
(the
Descent
of
the
Virgin)
The
next
place
of
interest
is
the
Centro
de
Visitantes
(Visitors
Center)
of
the
Parque
Nacional
de
la
Caldera
de
Taburiente
located
at
Km
23.9
on
road
TF-812
(open
daily
9amâ2pm
and
4pmâ6:30pm)
The
English
brochure
is
quite
helpful
giving
general
information
on
the
geology
and
geomorphology
flora
and
fauna
helpful
hints
on
camping
as
well
as
very
useful
color
diagram
of
the
hiking
possibilities
At
the
heart
of
La
Palma
Caldera
de
Taburiente
park
covering
4,690
hectares
(just
over
18
square
miles)
is
giant
crater:
1,500
(1,640
yards)
deep
with
diameter
of
10
km
(6.2
miles)
and
is
20
km
(12.4
miles)
in
circumference
It
was
created
some
400,000
years
ago
and
has
since
been
colonized
by
nature
into
green
fertile
valley
The
best
place
to
see
this
is
from
the
Mirador
La
Cumbrecita
which
is
km
(nearly
miles)
away
on
the
road
next
to
the
center
Following
it
the
road
finally
climbs
into
craggy
forest
surrounded
by
mist-shrouded
peaks
with
tall
pines
clinging
to
the
most
precarious
ledges
There
are
wonderful
views
from
here
(weather
permittingÂ âÂ which
it
doesnât
most
of
the
time)
including
the
Roque
de
los
Muchachos
and
the
monolithic
Roque
Idafe
said
to
have
been
the
sacred
altar
of
the
first
Guanche
natives
on
the
island
You
can
enjoy
the
Caldera
by
car
but
to
get
the
most
from
the
area
you
have
to
walk
The
main
road
then
continues
west
through
the
city
of
Los
Llanos
de
Aridane
and
then
turns
south
following
the
mountainside
to
Fuencaliente
The
most
southerly
point
on
the
main
road
it
is
famous
for
its
wines
But
rather
than
continue
directly
back
north
on
the
eastern
side
of
La
Palma
take
the
road
down
to
the
Faro
de
Fuencaliente
that
will
lead
you
in
near
circle
to
the
most
southern
tip
of
La
Palma
and
then
up
through
winding
twisting
road
back
to
Fuencaliente
The
first
stop
is
at
the
Bodegas
Carballo
where
you
can
sample
and
purchase
some
surprisingly
strong
local
wines
In
1677
the
local
volcano
San
Antonio
erupted
covering
once
fertile
land
with
ash
leaving
layer
of
lapilli
approximately
(6.5
ft)
deep
By
the
end
of
that
century
farmers
had
developed
technique
of
digging
trenches
that
enabled
them
to
reach
the
fertile
layer
of
earth
found
under
the
cinders
where
they
planted
the
vines
that
were
then
covered
with
the
extracted
ashes
This
somehow
allowed
the
plants
to
resist
adverse
weather
conditions
and
even
the
grape
plague
phylloxera
that
decimated
vines
all
over
Europe
in
the
second
half
of
the
19th
century
Just
across
the
road
you
can
stop
to
pay
visit
to
the
edge
of
the
volcanic
crater
of
VolcÃ¡n
de
San
Antonio
and
the
mirador
beyond
it
(open
daily
8amâ6pm)
In
an
exposed
windy
location
this
looks
considering
the
damage
it
did
exceedingly
benign
Just
south
of
here
are
even
more
recent
signs
of
volcanic
activity;
the
volcano
of
TeneguÃ­a
that
erupted
in
1971
fortunately
without
casualties
These
eruptions
sent
an
ever-widening
stream
of
molten
lava
rushing
down
the
green
hillside
here
and
you
can
see
it
now
petrified
and
black
as
the
road
runs
right
through
the
once
deadly
mass
Surprisingly
plÃ¡tanos
(bananas)
seem
to
take
liking
to
this
environment
and
can
be
seen
thriving
all
around
you
Once
down
to
sea
level
you
will
come
across
the
Playa
de
Zamora
small
beach
of
jet-black
sand
squeezed
in
between
the
surrealistic
lava
fields
short
distance
away
next
to
the
twin
lighthousesÂ âÂ one
old
and
one
newÂ âÂ is
tiny
fishermenâs
cove
with
stony
beach
that
has
tiny
restaurant
well
shack
really
that
serves
up
the
most
delicious
fresh
fried
fish
(see
page
139)
After
that
there
is
nothing
of
note
except
of
course
the
lava
fields
and
views
until
you
rejoin
the
main
road
at
Fuencaliente
Heading
back
north
towards
Santa
Cruz
stop
at
the
Cueva
de
Belmaco
is
in
order
Here
you
will
find
the
Parque
ArqueolÃ³gico
de
Belmaco
(Archaeological
Site
of
Belmaco)
The
first
stone
engravings
found
in
the
Canary
Islands
were
discovered
here
in
the
18th
century
and
the
ten
natural
cave
dwellings
with
their
magnificent
rock
engravings
were
the
home
to
the
BenahoritasÂ âÂ the
ancient
settlers
of
Benahoare
the
original
aboriginal
name
for
La
Palma
The
Northern
Loop
This
is
really
of
little
interest
and
the
roads
often
leave
something
to
be
desired
However
trip
up
the
eastern
coast
from
Santa
Cruz
to
just
south
of
Barlovento
isnât
too
long
and
the
rather
serpentine
road
runs
through
some
pretty
scenery
Make
the
first
stop
the
miradores
of
BartolomÃ©
and
La
MontaÃ±a
with
the
latter
being
little
higher
and
affording
beautiful
vistas
along
the
coast
in
both
directions
Head
next
for
the
seaside
village
of
San
AndrÃ©s
and
its
natural
swimming
pools
at
Charco
Azul
(blue
pool)
little
inland
from
San
AndrÃ©s
and
Sauces
is
the
Bosque
de
Los
Tilos
the
largest
wooded
area
in
the
whole
Canary
Islands
and
designated
âBiosphere
Reserveâ
under
the
protection
of
UNESCO
Heritage
of
Mankind
is
the
information
center
above
the
restaurant
(open
MondayâFriday
8amâ3pm)
The
final
destination
though
is
lovely
remote
site
just
before
Barlovento
where
after
tortuously
twisting
journey
down
through
banana
plantations
you
will
reach
the
Piscinas
Fajana;
literally
swimming
pools
built
into
the
rocks
and
fed
by
the
ocean
waters
that
often
crash
into
them
Showers
and
toilets
are
on
hand
as
is
the
pleasant
La
Gaviota
(the
Seagull)
restaurant/bar
and
the
views
north
of
the
cliffs
falling
straight
into
the
ocean
and
being
pounded
by
waves
are
breathtaking
The
goal
in
the
north
for
most
travelers
is
the
Roque
de
los
Muchachos
the
highest
point
in
the
island
at
2,423
(7,950
ft)
above
sea
level
There
are
several
ways
up
to
it
but
always
be
aware
of
the
weather;
what
looks
fine
from
sea
level
takes
on
different
perspective
at
nearly
2,438
(8,000
ft)
And
of
course
it
can
change
dramatically
and
quickly
so
go
prepared
clothes-wise
and
know
that
you
might
not
see
much
but
clouds
Besides
the
views
the
other
attraction
up
here
is
the
futuristic
Observatoria
de
AstrofÃ­sica
regarded
as
the
most
important
observatory
in
the
Northern
Hemisphere
and
home
to
some
of
the
worldâs
most
important
telescopes
including
the
4-m
(165-inch)
William
Herschel
telescope
However
as
it
is
only
open
to
visitors
for
few
days
each
summer
most
will
have
to
be
satisfied
with
just
seeing
it
from
the
outside

Gran

is
second
to

for
its
combination
of
perfect
beaches
and
sophisticated
nightlife
for
its
history
and

marvelous
natural

Almost
circular
in

of
236
km
(over
146
miles)
with
over
50
km
(31
miles)
occupied
by
diverse
beaches
Gran
Canaria
is
the
classic
volcanic
cone
in
profile
and
its
mountainous
character
causes
the
climate
to
change
radically
with
latitude
and
altitude
You
can
leave
wet
and
chilly
Las
Palmas
in
the
morning
and
an
hour
later
be
enjoying
hot
sunny
day
in
Maspalomas
Gran
Canaria
is
known
not
without
reason
as
the
âcontinent
in
miniature.â
The
coastline
ranges
from
awe-inspiring
cliffs
to
golden
dunes
Inland
you
can
choose
between
stark
mountains
and
tranquil
valleys;
in
fact
there
are
32
protected
areas
that
cover
42.7%
of
the
islandâs
surface
Las
Palmas
Bustling
Las
Palmas
(population
450,000Â âÂ the
largest
city
in
the
Canaries
and
the
seventh
largest
in
Spain)
is
major
commercial
and
historical
center
cosmopolitan
resort
and
vital
seaport
all
rolled
into
one
It
is
one
of
the
busiest
ports
in
the
world
The
real
hub
of
Las
Palmas
is
the
Parque
de
Santa
Catalina
This
square
is
effectively
one
gigantic
outdoor
cafÃ©
that
buzzes
day
and
night
and
is
just
short
walk
to
Playa
de
las
Canteras
This
superb
golden
beach
stretches
for
to
km
(2
to
miles)
and
natural
reef
just
offshore
means
that
the
water
couldnât
be
calmer
Las
Canteras
and
the
area
behind
it
reflect
the
cityâs
cosmopolitan
nature
Like
the
city
in
general
it
has
seen
better
days
and
is
losing
younger
tourist
trade
to
the
smarter
modern
resorts
in
the
south
Away
from
Las
Canteras
make
your
first
stop
Doramas
Parque
pleasantly
landscaped
park
named
after
Guanche
island
chieftain
and
adjacent
to
the
park
is
the
Pueblo
Canario
(Canary
Village)
This
is
romanticized
version
of
Canarian
village
where
you
can
shop
for
handicrafts
and
watch
displays
of
folk
dancing
and
singing
The
man
who
conceived
it
was
local
artist
and
designer
NÃ©stor
de
la
Torre
(1888â1938)
and
museum
of
his
exotic
art
is
in
the
Pueblo
Further
south
is
Triana
one
of
the
older
barrios
(suburbs)
Today
it
is
known
for
its
upmarket
shops
and
the
long
pleasant
pedestrianized
street
of
Calle
Mayor
de
Triana
offers
just
about
everything
for
both
tourists
and
locals
Adjoining
Triana
is
Vegueta
the
oldest
part
of
the
city
where
Spanish
forces
first
set
up
camp
in
1478
History
lurks
behind
every
wall
and
this
is
delightful
place
just
to
wander
around
Christopher
Columbus
knew
these
streets
and
he
prayed
at
the
Ermita
de
San
Antonio
Abad
before
setting
off
on
his
first
Voyage
of
Discovery
to
the
New
World
The
present
building
dates
from
the
18th
century
Close
by
on
Calle
ColÃ³n
is
the
beautiful
15th-century
Casa
de
ColÃ³n;
this
elegant
house
with
its
charming
courtyard
was
formerly
the
residence
of
the
islandâs
first
governor
and
Columbus
is
said
to
have
stayed
here
on
three
occasions
Now
an
atmospheric
museum
it
recreates
the
Age
of
Discovery
with
exhibits
of
navigational
instruments
charts
weapons
and
everyday
items
of
the
period
Around
the
corner
stands
the
vast
Gothic
and
neo-Classic
bulk
of
the
Catedral
de
Santa
Ana
with
its
Diocesan
Museum
of
Sacred
Art
which
is
not
pretty
but
certainly
impressive
and
best
seen
by
night
when
floodlighting
softens
its
harsh
grimy
front
Facing
the
cathedral
are
several
green
bronze
statues
of
the
aboriginal
mastiff
dogs
after
whom
the
Canary
Islands
are
said
to
have
been
named
(from
the
Latin
canes)
Just
down
from
the
cathedral
is
the
modernistic
Centro
Atlantico
de
Arte
Moderno
(CAAM);
(Atlantic
Center
of
Modern
Art)
With
five
floors
of
exhibitions
this
is
the
southernmost
contemporary
art
center
in
the
European
Union
and
focuses
on
the
work
of
young
Canarian
creators
Nearby
the
Museo
Canario
holds
the
islandsâ
most
important
collection
from
Guanche
times
with
the
highlight
being
the
room
of
skulls
and
mummies
depicting
the
Guanchesâ
fascination
with
death
(see
page
14)
The
hills
surrounding
here
and
on
the
southern
approach
to
Las
Palmas
are
full
of
apartment
buildings
and
the
like
and
would
not
normally
merit
any
attention
However
the
city
government
readily
realized
that
these
areas
looked
at
the
very
least
rather
bland
To
counteract
this
they
had
the
ingenuity
to
brighten
them
up;
and
nowadays
all
the
buildings
are
painted
in
the
most
unusual
and
very
attractive
array
of
pastel
colors

the

are
linked
to
Las

and
Gran

international
airport
by
the
fast
and
featureless
autopista
(motorway)
San
AgustÃ­n
is
restrained
area
of
apartments
catering
for
more
mature
and
discerning
vacationers
Playa
del
InglÃ©s
is
more
robust
as
the
very
name
(Beach
of
the
English)
might
suggest
although
it
attracts
numerous
German
visitors
as
well
This
is
fun-and-sun
sprawling
resort
of
high-rise
hotels
shopping
malls
and
fast-food
restaurants
The
nightlife
at
the
more
than
numerous
discos
bars
and
clubs
can
be
hectic
During
the
day
people
can
sun
themselves
on
the
golden
beaches
that
stretch
for
16
featureless
kilometers
(10
miles)
so
there
is
room
enough
for
everyone
Maspalomas
is
famous
for
its
dunes
that
cover
an
wide
area
of
250
hectares
(618
acres)
which
are
sufficiently
large
and
unspoiled
to
constitute
mini-Sahara
of
great
beauty
They
are
protected
nature
reserve
but
you
are
far
more
likely
to
see
naturists
than
naturalists
here
Playa
de
Maspalomas
is
the
stretch
of
dunes
close
to
the
landmark
lighthouse
and
is
home
to
small
but
ever
growing
number
of
top-class
hotels
As
you
might
expect
there
is
the
usual
plethora
of
family
attractions
nearby
the
most
important
of
which
is
Palmitos
Parque
that
provides
an
excellent
day
out
for
all
the
family
Performing
parrots
amuse
with
circus
tricks
and
caged
birds
of
every
imaginable
hue
are
kept
in
beautiful
gardens
The
real
stars
however
are
the
exotic
free-flying
residents
AquaSur
is
at
130,000
square
(over
32
acres)
the
largest
waterpark
in
the
Canary
Islands
The
other
major
attraction
Sioux
City
is
recreation
of
the
Wild
West
with
gun-fights
lynchings
saloon
gals
and
lassooing
tricks
etc
The
Friday
evening
Big
Wild
West
Show
(with
barbecue)
is
great
fun
for
children
West
of
Maspalomas
the
coastline
becomes
dominated
by
towering
rather
barren
looking
cliffs
that
every
now
and
again
form
natural
bays
and
coves
well-suited
to
become
resorts
in
their
own
right
However
this
area
is
overdeveloped;
what
is
surprising
is
that
development
continues
apace
especially
given
the
lack
of
building
space
Developers
however
have
resolved
this
problem
very
innovatively
by
literally
building
into
the
cliff
sides
themselves
and
this
often
leaves
visitors
with
the
rather
surreal
sight
of
wall-to-wall
development
taking
up
every
inch
of
these
steep
bays
Nevertheless
some
of
the
places
retain
certain
charm
Puerto
Rico
is
the
most
attractive
beach
resort
on
this
coast
But
it
too
has
been
grossly
overdeveloped
so
its
lovely
sheltered
golden
beach
can
become
unbearably
crowded
Its
marina
is
the
focal
point
for
numerous
marine
adventures
that
will
suit
all
tastes
LÃ­neas
SalmÃ³n
has
eight
boats
and
runs
frequent
and
inexpensive
ferry
service
between
Puerto
Rico
ArguineguÃ­n
and
MogÃ¡n
offering
charming
way
of
getting
to
know
this
part
of
the
coastline
Afriyachts
Puerto
Rico
has
two
catamarans
that
run
five-hour
cruises
Dolphin
cruises
are
popular
too
and
glass
bottom
boats
operate
from
the
port
Sport
fishing
will
appeal
to
the
more
adventurous
and
this
part
of
the
coast
is
just
the
place
for
it;
consequently
numerous
boats
operate
from
Puerto
Rico
Puerto
de
MogÃ¡n
should
be
lesson
to
all
resort
developers
in
how
to
provide
accommodation
that
is
functional
very
attractive
and
totally
in
sympathy
with
its
surroundings
The
accommodation
here
is
an
interpretation
of
local
townhouses
that
are
ablaze
with
bougainvillea
arranged
in
pedestrian-only
squares
with
narrow
alleyways
and
arches
leading
to
an
attractive
marina
This
is
lined
with
stylish
cafÃ©s
and
restaurants
jazz
and
piano
bars
and
small
boutiques
All
that
is
lacking
is
good
beach
submarine
trip
also
dives
from
here
and
one
of
the
best
nautical
trips
is
an
excursion
aboard
the
Windjammer
San
Miguel
fine
old
transatlantic
sailing
ship
built
in
1919
Northern
Coast
and
Hinterland
Arucas
is
workaday
town
overshadowed
by
an
immense
20th-century
neo-Gothic
cathedral
that
stands
out
like
sore
thumb
The
road
west
from
Arucas
follows
truly
dizzying
route
through
the
mountains
past
several
caves
Some
provide
shelter
for
goats
but
others
are
inhabited
by
people
and
are
complete
with
running
water
and
electricity
The
route
passes
through
the
tidy
small
town
of
Moya
It
is
well
worth
stopping
to
see
its
church
precariously
perched
on
the
very
edge
of
ravine
An
act
of
faith
indeed!
Just
off
the
coast
road
is
the
Cenobio
de
ValerÃ³n
(Convent
of
ValerÃ³n)
This
is
badly
sign-posted
Take
the
turn
off
just
before
GuÃ­a
away
from
the
sea
This
convent
is
actually
series
of
Guanche
caves
cut
into
steep
mountainside
According
to
island
lore
the
daughters
of
noble
families
spent
their
youth
in
these
small
cells
serving
the
native
gods
At
the
age
of
15
they
were
allowed
to
marry
or
to
remain
in
the
sanctuary
for
life
More
prosaically
the
caves
were
probably
also
used
for
grain
storage
Around
this
area
you
could
spy
some
modern
cave
dwellers
Continue
south
towards
Agaete
which
is
the
most
attractive
of
the
small
northern
towns
Agaeteâs
port
Puerto
de
las
Nieves
is
haven
of
calm
among
the
formidable
rocky
cliffs
that
make
up
this
inhospitable
stretch
of
coast
From
here
the
coast
road
ascends
very
sharply
amid
sparse
windblown
greenery
and
the
drop
seawards
can
be
frighteningly
steep
An
alternative
route
is
to
drive
km
(4
miles)
inland
to
the
fine
viewpoint
at
Los
Berrazales
Central
Sights
The
mountainous
center
of
the
island
makes
for
very
tiring
driving
You
will
rarely
get
out
of
the
lower
gears
but
the
wonderful
panoramas
are
ample
reward
Pine
forests
almond
groves
gnarled
mountains
sheer
cliffs
and
cloudy
mountaintops
beckon
The
best
and
certainly
the
most
popular
vantage
point
is
the
Cruz
de
Tejeda
(Cross
of
Tejeda)Â âÂ at
1,463
(4,800
ft)
one
of
the
few
points
inland
where
you
are
almost
guaranteed
to
meet
fellow
tourists
small
cluster
of
cafÃ©s
fruit
and
souvenir
stalls
and
men
with
donkeys
await
you
at
the
summit
The
magnificent
panorama
includes
two
rock
formations
that
were
once
worshipped
by
the
Guanches
The
most
distinctive
is
the
statuesque
dark
broody
bulk
of
Roque
Nublo
at
1,817
(5,961
ft)
and
it
takes
little
imagination
to
understand
the
primitive
inhabitantsâ
fascination
with
this
formation;
the
other
is
the
Roque
Bentaiga
As
the
Cruz
de
Tejeda
is
the
hub
of
the
island
there
are
any
number
of
routes
to
and
from
it
and
almost
all
have
something
to
offer
so
consider
ascending
on
one
route
and
descending
via
another
From
Las
Palmas
you
have
two
options
The
most
northern
route
runs
through
the
peaceful
valley
town
of
Teror
The
old
whitewashed
houses
often
built
around
graceful
patios
boast
fine
traditional
carved
balconies
The
major
landmark
here
is
typically
large
Canarian
church
the
BasÃ­lica
Nuestra
SeÃ±ora
del
Pino
(Our
Lady
of
the
Pine)
This
commemorates
the
miraculous
discovery
in
1481
in
the
branches
of
pine
tree
of
sacred
effigy
The
Blessed
Virgin
of
Teror
is
also
the
patron
saint
of
Gran
Canaria
Alternatively
take
the
main
road
that
runs
inland
from
close
to
the
cathedral
and
heads
southwest
through
the
towns
of
Santa
BrÃ­gida
and
Vega
de
San
Mateo
offering
panoramic
views
of
the
east
of
the
island
Because
the
climate
here
is
exceptionally
mild
many
Canarians
and
foreign
residents
have
built
very
desirable
homes
in
these
hills
with
the
gardens
around
their
villas
often
being
magnificent
small
diversion
along
this
route
is
certainly
worthwhile
Just
few
kilometers
out
of
Las
Palmas
follow
the
signs
to
Bandama
the
road
(open
8amâ10pm)
leads
up
to
the
nearby
Caldera
de
Bandama
one
of
the
islandâs
finest
natural
features
and
spectacular
mirador
in
its
own
right
This
volcanic
crater
almost
kilometer
(more
than
half
mile)
across
is
green
fertile.and
drops
some
198
(650
ft)
down
scenic
spiraling
road
leads
to
the
top
where
the
Real
Club
de
Golf
enjoys
such
picturesque
location
that
even
non-golfers
are
tempted
to
pick
up
club
The
views
from
here
take
in
the
mountains
fertile
valley
and
vast
stretches
of
the
coastline
from
Las
Palmas
to
the
distant
south
From
the
west
of
the
island
drive
north
from
Agaete
and
then
turn
inland
following
the
signs
to
Tejeda
for
really
pleasant
and
not
unduly
difficult
mountain
ascent
The
valleys
here
are
wide
and
their
slopes
play
host
to
some
small
farms;
it
is
one
of
the
few
places
in
the
islands
where
you
will
come
across
farm
animals
Of
interest
too
are
the
fantastic
views
across
the
ocean
on
fine
day
to
the
snowcapped
Mount
Teide
floating
majestically
above
the
clouds
and
the
mountain
peaks
and
lush
valleys
of
Gran
Canaria
itself
Before
reaching
Tejeda
turn
off
to
the
village
of
Artenara
to
the
southwest
and
what
is
undoubtedly
the
best
restaurant
view
on
the
island
The
place
in
question
is
MÃ©son
de
la
Silla
not
easy
to
spot
parallel
to
the
main
road
dark
tunnel
leads
through
the
rock
with
no
hint
of
what
is
to
come
then
emerges
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
to
bright
180-degree
mountain
panorama
To
the
left
the
head
of
the
valley
green
and
dotted
with
whitewashed
little
villages;
it
leads
up
to
Tejeda
itself
but
the
more
dramatic
vistas
are
directly
in
front
and
to
the
right
Here
the
scenario
is
dramatic
indeed;
jagged
peaks
fill
the
horizon
and
many
smaller
ones
are
spread

Population:

Lanzarote
is
startling
place
representing
the
triumph
of
civilization
over
hostile
environment
and
the
entire
island
has
been
declared
Biosphere
Reserve
by
UNESCO
Its
pock-marked
lunar-like
surface
60
km
(37
miles)
long
and
20
km
(121/2
miles)
wide
is
dotted
with
more
than
300
volcanoes
yet
onions
potatoes
tomatoes
melons
and
grapes
all
spring
in
abundance
from
the
black
ash
Its
most
unusual
farm
crop
however
is
the
Cochineal
Beetle
that
when
squashed
emits
red
dye
used
as
coloring
for
Campari
and
lipsticks
Newer
to
the
tourist
scene
than
either
Gran
Canaria
or
Tenerife
Lanzarote
seems
to
have
learned
from
the
excesses
of
its
sister
islands
Here
small
is
beautiful
and
harmony
with
the
environment
is
the
philosophy
The
South
ofthe
Island
Arrecife
the
principal
port
and
latter-day
capital
is
characterless
place
with
just
two
saving
gracesÂ âÂ the
Castillo
de
San
Gabriel
and
the
Castillo
de
San
JosÃ©
The
16th-century
Castillo
de
San
Gabriel
situated
close
to
the
center
of
town
houses
small
museum
of
no
great
standing
But
it
is
worth
the
walk
across
the
small
drawbridge
and
over
the
lagoon
onto
the
small
island
that
the
castle
used
to
deter
pirates
The
Castillo
de
San
JosÃ©
few
kilometers
to
the
north
is
far
more
interesting
proposition
Built
in
the
18th
century
this
well-preserved
fortress
that
once
guarded
the
harbor
it
overlooks
now
houses
the
late
CÃ©sar
Manriqueâs
small
but
impressive
International
Museum
of
Contemporary
Art
This
includes
works
by
Picasso
and
MirÃ³
and
is
also
notable
for
the
contrast
between
the
modern
exhibits
and
the
ancient
structure
that
houses
them
The
islandâs
major
resort
is
Puerto
del
Carmen
and
its
long
golden
beach
stretches
for
about
km
(3
miles)
and
comfortably
accommodates
its
visitors
The
sea
is
calm
and
ideal
for
families
Restaurants
of
every
conceivable
type
bars
and
shops
line
the
Avenida
de
las
Playas
Lanzaroteâs
one
outbreak
of
mass
commercialism
The
old
town
just
west
of
the
beach
has
charming
small
harbor
area
with
traditional
bars
and
restaurants
and
an
array
of
marine
adventures
awaiting
you
Of
these
the
Blue
Delfin
and
the
Princesa
Ico
both
glass
bottomed
catamarans
offer
variety
of
trips
sport
fishing
charters
leave
from
here
also
If
you
prefer
seeing
the
area
from
the
air
albeit
attached
to
motorboat
then
Paracraft
offers
you
the
chance
to
paraglide
The
road
west
leads
through
the
beautifully
tended
village
of
to
the
rather
more
earthy
Salinas
de
Janubio
(Salt
Flats
at
Janubio)
Every
spring
for
the
Corpus
Christi
festivities
the
flats
provide
the
salt
that
local
artists
dye
into
variety
of
colors
and
pour
onto
the
streets
of
Arrecife
to
create
religious
and
secular
designs
(see

little
farther
north
are
two
more
natural
spectacles
Los
Hervideros
is
section
of
rocky
coast
where
the
crashing
waves
break
ferociously
against
the
cliffs
and
sea
caves
El
Golfo
by
contrast
is
placid
emerald-green
lagoon
set
beside
cliff
that
resembles
gigantic
petrified
tidal
wave
just
about
to
break
This
is
actually
the
inner
rim
of
volcanic
cone
half
of
which
has
disappeared
beneath
the
sea
The
strata
colors
and
manic
whirls
are
fascinating
sight
Note
that
El
Golfo
is
not
apparent
from
the
roadside
Park
your
car
on
the
rough
ledge
just
off
the
main
road
on
the
left
as
you
begin
the
descent
into
the
village
of
El
Golfo
(renowned
for
the
quality
of
its
fish
restaurants)
and
follow
the
rough
footpath
over
the
cliff
The
newly
created
resort
of
Playa
Blanca
on
the
south
coast
the
third
major
tourist
center
on
the
island
is
host
to
the
Fuerteventura
ferry
marina
and
good
golden
beach
However
just
few
miles
east
along
unpaved
roads
are
the
best
sands
on
the
island
collectively
known
as
the
Papagayo
(parrot)
beaches
You
will
need
four-wheel-drive
vehicle
local
directions
(there
are
no
signposts)
and
little
else
as
on
Papagayo
naturism
is
the
norm
The
Ganges
Seis
is
taxi
boat
that
will
drop
you
off
there
in
the
morning
and
return
to
pick
you
up
in
the
afternoon
An
alternate
way
to
get
there
is
to
take
the
Catlanza
s.l
modern
catamaran
that
sails
out
of
Puerto
CaleroÂ âÂ the
highlight
is
when
it
drops
anchor
46
(50
yards)
off
the
Papagayo
beach
Puerto
Calero
just
few
minutes
south
of
Puerto
del
Carmen
but
with
an
entirely
different
ambiance
is
rather
new
and
dominated
by
its
modern
marina
that
is
lined
by
row
of
restaurants
offering
all
kinds
of
cuisine
Besides
the
Catlanza
catamaran
it
is
also
the
home
port
of
Submarine
Safaris
which
offers
the
opportunity
to
explore
under
the
local
waters
The
trip
that
lasts
one
hour
and
when
it
settles
onto
the
seabed

(33
yards)
or
so
down
divers
go
out
to
feed
the
fish
The
highlight
of
your
trip
to
Lanzarote
and
the
magical
ingredient
that
makes
this
island
so
special
is
to
be
found
in
the
MontaÃ±as
del
Fuego
(Mountains
of
Fire)
The
Parque
Nacional
de
Timanfaya
which
encompasses
the
mountains
in
its
200
square
km
(77.2
square
miles)
starts
just
north
of
Yaiza
and
its
boundary
is
marked
by
an
impish
devil
motif
This
desolate
national
park
was
formed
largely
over
the
course
of
16
cataclysmic
months
during
1730
and
1731
Eleven
villages
were
buried
forever
and
many
of
the
people
left
the
island
for
Gran
Canaria

the
small

to
the
MontaÃ±as
del
Fuego
Your
introduction
to
the
inner
sanctum
of
the
mountains
leaves
no
doubt
that
at
least
one
of
these
volcanoes
(in
fact
the
very
one
that
you
are
standing
on!)
is
not
dead
just
sleeping
In
fact
less
than
10
(32
ft)
under
the
surface
the
temperature
reaches
as
much
as
600Âº
(1,112ÂºF)
and
at
the
surface
level
it
can
at
certain
places
get
to
120Âº
(248ÂºF)

coach
toursÂ âÂ included

depart
to
explore
the
incredible
landscape
Any
badlands
that
you
may
have
seen
up
to
this
point
have
been
mere
appetizer
for
the
main
course
The
words
lunar
and
alien
are
worked
to
exhaustion
in
attempts
to
describe
the
area
and
still
scarcely
do
justice
to
the
dramatic
scenery
This
was
caused
by
massive
eruption
(the
volcano
was
active
from
September
1730
to
April
1736)
during
which
420
houses
were
completely
destroyed
The
last
activity
of
the
volcano
began
in
1824
and
lasted
10
years
With
rain
so
rare
and
underground
water
sources
extremely
limited
you
may
wonder
how
Lanzarote
manages
to
survive
as
an
agricultural
island
The
black
topsoil
is
the
secret
discovered
by
the
farmers
in
their
adversity
The
porous
volcanic
particles
that
make
up
the
topsoil
are
useless
in
themselves
but
act
as
sponge
for
the
moisture
of
the
night
air
obtaining
water
for
the
plants
and
eliminating
the
need
for
rain
They
are
therefore
piled
on
top
of
the
crops
and
only
need
replacing
around
once
every
20
years
The
other
Canary
Islands
also
use
this
method
The
most
impressive
example
of
this
type
of
farming
is
the
vineyards
around
the
valley
of
La
Geria
Each
vine
is
set
in
its
own
mini-crater
protected
from
wind
and
excess
sun
by
low
semi-circular
wall
of
lava
stones
(other
crops
are
also
protected
in
this
manner)
The
horseshoe
patterns
thus
formed
stretch
way
up
the
mountains
and
apparently
into
infinity
producing
an
almost
hypnotic
effect
Not
only
do
the
vineyards
look
good
the
end
product
also
tastes
very
good
and
there
are
several
bodegas
in
the
Geria
valley
where
you
can
sample
the
excellent
local
malvasÃ­a
Those
with
an
interest
in
wine
will
want
to
pay
visit
to
the
Museo
del
Vino
de
Lanzarote
El
Grifo;
not
too
far
away
at
San
BartolomÃ©
de

The
Monument

Manrique
creation
adorns
the
entrance
to
this
bodega
that
has
been
producing
wines
since
the
18th
century
It
is
the
oldest
in
the
Canaries
Enjoy

The
North
of
the
Island
On
an
island
so
dominated
by
the
works
and
creativity
of
one
man
it
would
be
inappropriate
not
to
pay
visit
to
the
FundaciÃ³n
CÃ©sar
Manrique;
Taro
de
Tahiche;
Manrique
lived
here
and
as
you
might
have
come
to
expect
it
is
rather
unusual
Built
in
1968
it
is
located
over
river
of
lava
formed
from
the
eruptions
between
1730
and
1736
and
takes
advantage
at
its
lowest
point
of
five
volcanic
bubbles
to
create
the
strange
but
nonetheless
impressive
living
space
The
geographic
center
of
Lanzarote
lies
km
(51â2
miles)
northwest
of
the
capital
at
Mozaga
focal
point
of
the
islandâs
viniculture
Here
the
late
CÃ©sar

designed
and
erected
huge
white
modern

dedicated
to
the
peasant

resort
where
athletes
of
the
highest
level
come
for
both
training
and
relaxation
is
the
tiny
village
of
Caleta
de
Famara
It
has
windswept
beaches
with
views
of
the
daunting
cliffs
of
the
Famara
Massif
that
lead
up
to
the
Mirador
del
RÃ­o
and
Graciosa
island
There
is
not
much
to
do
along
this
coastline
except
sunbathe
and
windsurf
but
as
the
currents
can
be
dangerous
here
be
sure
to
take
care
Teguise
is
fine
old
town
of
cobbled
streets
and
gracious
mansions
and
was
the
island
capital
until
1852
Now
it
is
calm
and
quiet
for
six
days
of
the
week
On
Sundays
handicrafts
market
comes
to
town
where
you
can
buy
timpleÂ âÂ a
small
ukulele-like
instrument
used
by
local
folkloric
musicians
Several
of
its
old
buildings
have
been
converted
to
craft
and
antique
shops
and
restaurants
Overlooking
the
town
is
the
16th-century
Castillo
de
Santa
BÃ¡rbara
The
views
from
this
wind-blown
point
are
worth
the
trip
alone
High
on
top
of
the
extinct
volcano
of
Guanapay
the
castle
now
hosts
the
Museo
del
Emigrante
Canario
where
sepia
photos
and
nostalgic
exhibits
tell
the
sad
story
of
how
mass
emigration
to
South
America
was
the
only
option
left
for
many
Canarian
families
Costa
Teguise
just
north
of
Arrecife
is
totally
modern
resort
comprising
several
urbanizaciÃ³nes
with
time-shares
hotels
and
apartments
designed
for
wealthy
clientele
It
is
no
surprise
to
realize
that
the
King
and
Queen
of
Spain
have
an
official
residence
here
and
it
is
where
they
welcomed
the
New
Milennium
There
is
handful
of
good
sandy
beaches
particularly
Playa
de
las
Cucharas
where
water
sports
thrive
and
windsurfing
is
particularly
popular
Look
for
the
championship
golf
course
and
the
Ocean
Park
Water

The
coast
road
east
passes
the
town
of
Guatiza
where
prickly
pears
abound
and
where
cochineal
beetles
are
still
cultivated
(see
page

CÃ©sar
Manrique
also
cultivated
the
spiny
flora
into
beautiful
JardÃ­n
de
Cactus
complete
with
working
windmill
that
produces
its
own
gofio
(see

There
is
more
Manrique
design
to
admire
at
the
caves
of
Jameos
del
Agua;
opened
in
1966
this
was
the
first
attraction
designed
by
the
great
creator
where
his
landscaping
talents
have
embellished
and
transformed
grotto
and
underground
lagoon
into
short
fantasy
journey
Ethereal
mood
music
accompanies
your
descent
into
the
cave
lushly
planted
with
luxuriant
foliage
Peer
into
the
black
lagoon
and
you
can
pick
out
the
very
rare
tiny
blind
albino
crabs
Munidopsis
polymorpha
which
live
here
Resist
though
the
temptation
to
throw
coins
into
the
crystal
clear
lagoon;
the
attendant
corrosion
of
the
metal
kills
the
crabs
Finally
you
emerge
from
the
cave
into
South
Seas
paradise
complete
with
its
accompanying
swimming
pool
In
the
evening
the
Jameos
del
Agua
is
transformed
into
night-club
where
folklore
shows
are
regularly
staged
The
Cueva
de
los
Verdes
(Green
Caves)
found
short
distance
away
across
the
main
road
are
part
of
the
same
system
and
were
blasted
through
the
earth
by
exploding
lava
There
is
guided
tour
that
includes
some
memorable
sound
and
light
effects
evoking
the
menacing
volcano
most
effectively
At
the
northern
tip
of
the
island
is
the
small
fishing
port
of
Orzola
This
is
the
embarkation
point
for
the
tiny
island
of
Graciosa
ferry
service
run
by
LÃ­neas
Maritimas
Romero
four
times
day
(JulyâSep)
and
three
times
the
rest
of
the
year
With
superb
beaches
and
complete
lack
of
tourist
development
this
is
the
place
to
get
away
from
it
all
for
the
day
For
an
unforgettable
view
of
Isla
Graciosa
and
much
more
drive
up
to
the
Mirador
del
RÃ­o
(admission:
400
ptas
r2.40)
This
is
yet
another
of
CÃ©sar
Manriqueâs
creations
and
one
that
certainly
shouldnât
be
missed
The
views
from
here
really
are
wonderful
indeed
and
it
is
probably
the
most
spectacular
mirador
in
all
the
Canaries
Huge
cliffs
curve
down
to
the
beach
with
Graciosa
just
across
the
water
and
with
the
two
other
smaller
islands
MontaÃ±a
Clara
and
Alegranza
in
the
background
Combined
with
Graciosa
and
small
section
of
the
northwest
coastline
of
Lanzarote
they
form
the
Parque
Nacional
del
ArchipiÃ©lago
Chinijo
The
only
sound
here
is
that
of
the
wind
gently
whistling
through
El
RÃ­o
the
waterway
separating
Lanzarote
and
Graciosa
Besides
its
huge
picture
windows
note
in
the
bar/restaurant
some
more
of
Manriqueâs
creative
sculptures
Another
addition
to
the
islandâs
burgeoning
tourist
attractions
is
the
Guinate
Tropical
Bird

just
south
of
the
Mirador
del

Within
its
45,000
square
(11.1

At
the

count
there
were
152
beaches
along
the
340

(210

of

50
km
(31

of
which
are
of
yellow
sand
and
25
km
(16

of
black

stone
giving
it
the
best
selection
of
beaches
in
the
Canary
Islands
Enhancing
these
even
more
Fuerteventuraâs
coastal
shelf
allows
for
the
existence
of
shallow
transparent
waters
that
often
acquire
beautiful
turquoise
color
The
island
is
situated
less
than
115
km
(71
miles)
off
the
coast
of
North
Africa
and
most
of
its
sand
is
blown
here
from
the
Sahara
giving
new
meaning
to
the
term
âdesert
island.â
Fuerteventura
is
barren
and
windswept
almost
to
the
point
of
desolationÂ âÂ or
grandeur
depending
on
your
point
of
view
So
sparse
is
the
population
that
the
density
22
inhabitants
per
square
km
is
the
lowest
of
the
islands
Goats
survive
better
here
than
people
and
they
outnumber
the
human
inhabitants
However
the
harsh
terrain
can
only
support
so
many
goats
The

survive
for
their

The
wind
whistles
with
great
force
in
Fuerteventura
and
may
even
have
given
the
island
its
name
corruption
and
inversion
of
el
viento
fuerte
(the
strong
wind)
However
it
is
wind
that
seems
to
be
bringing
good
fortune
to
the
island
as
the
presence
of
so
many
windsurfers
proves
With
the
growth
of
tourism
the
island
has
become
one
of
the
worldâs
leading
windsurfing
centers
The
North
The
once
sleepy
fishing
port
of
Corralejo
has
been
transformed
into
the
busy
Lanzarote
ferry
terminal
and
bustling
resort
popular
with
the
British
Although
the
old
port
area
still
has
colorful
fishing
boats
and
some
good
fish
restaurants
the
town
is
in
the
main
somewhat
less
than
inspiring
and
one
of
the
least
pleasant
of
the
resorts
in
the
Canary
Islands
favored
by
the
British
There
are
two
routes
south
to
Puerto
del
Rosario
the
capital
FV-1
follows
the
east
coast
of
the
island
and
just
few
minutes
from
the
center
of
Corralejo
there
are
some
magnificent
long
white
beaches
and
dunes
stretching
for
some
30
square
km
(12
square
miles)
These
(along
with
Isla
de
los
Lobos)
have
been
declared
national
park
and
are
popular
with
nudists
The
island
lies
km
(2
miles)
offshore
and
its
beaches
are
even
more
secluded
than
those
on
the
âmainland.â
The
fishing
here
is
outstanding
Glass-bottomed
ferry-boats
depart
regularly
from
Corralejo
The
rest
of
the
route
to
Puerto
del
Rosario
once
named
Puerto
Cabras
(Port
of
the
Goats)
because
in
the
18th
century
it
was
used
mainly
for
the
raising
of
goats
has
nothing
of
interest
for
tourists
and
the
town
itself
is
rather
drab
place
The
inland
route
south
to
Puerto
del
Rosario
follows
the
FV-101
and
diversion
west
along
the
FV-109
will
bring
you
first
to
the
Zoo
Safari
CalderÃ³n
Hondo
There
you
can
opt
for
either
half-hour
camel
trip
or
11â2
hour
safari
to
the
lunar
landscape
of
the
Volcano
CalderÃ³n
Hondo
Next
comes
the
lace-making
town
of
Lajares
And
if
you
really
want
to
get
away
from
it
all
continue
on
to
El
Cotillo
This
tiny
fishing
village
on
the
east
coast
also
boasts
some
excellent
beachesÂ wonderful
for
windsurfing
plus
handful
of
local
bars
and
some
basic
restaurants
Heading
back
south
from
El
Cotillo
the
FV-10
rejoins
the
FV-101
at
the
small
town
of
La
Oliva
This
is
not
especially
attractive
but
it
does
feature
two
places
of
interest
Just
off
the
main
road
stands
the
Casa
de
los
Coroneles
(House
of
the
Colonels)
Its
name
derives
from
its
18th-century
tenants
who
once
ruled
the
island
The
decaying
cream-colored
building
still
exudes
certain
haughty
if
melancholy
grandeur
By
contrast
the
nearby
Centro
de
Arte
Canario
is
bright
and
modern
exhibiting
the
works
of
some
of
the
finest
living
Canarian
artists
little
further
south
just
past
Tindaya
the
road
makes
dog-leg
towards
Puerto
in
the
east
and
if
you
look
very
carefully
to
your
right
you
will
see
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
mountains
the
Monumento
Don
Miguel
de
Unamuno
Unamuno
writer
and
vice-chancellor
of
the
famous
University
of
Salamanca
the
oldest
in
Spain
made
himself
unpopular
in
1924
with
the
dictator
of
Spain
General
Primo
de
Ribera
His
criticisms
of
the
dictator
resulted
in
his
being
exiled
to
Fuerteventura
Although
he
fled
to
the
somewhat
more
civilized
Paris
after
few
months
he
loved
to
describe
the
beauty
of
the
islands
in
his
writing
His
most
famous
quote
states
that
the
Canaries
were
âan
oasis
in
the
desert
of
civilization.â
The
Central
Area
The
central
mountain
range
is
encircled
by
two
roads:
the
FV-20
that
initially
heads
west
from
Puerto
del
Rosario
then
drops
south
alongside
the
mountains
to
Antigua
and
Tuineje
before
meeting
up
with
the
main
north
to
south
FV-2
just
north
of
Gran
Tarajal;
and
the
FV-30
that
loops
around
off
the
FV-20
north
of
the
range
dropping
into
the
Betancuria
valley
and
continuing
south
through
winding
terrain
to
PÃ¡jara
and
Tuinije
where
it
meets
up
again
with
the
FV-20
As
you
can
join
this
loop
from
the
north
south
or
center
and
even
cut
across
the
mountains
at
one
point
you
can
start
out
from
most
parts
of
the
island
Starting
from
Puerto
del
Rosario
take
the
FV-30
diversion
off
the
FV-20
and
follow
it
until
you
see
the
signs
for
the
Mirador
de
Morro
Velosa;
soon
gate
man
will
demand
300
ptas
r1.80
per
person
but
this
will
prove
to
be
worthwhile
investment
At
the
summit
and
with
commanding
views
of
the
surrounding
mountains
and
with
the
Atlantic
Ocean
shimmering
in
the
distance
is
delightful
combination
of
cafÃ©
bar
and
viewpoint
that
owes
its
creative
design
to
none
other
than
CÃ©sar
Manrique
Betancuria
by
far
the
most
attractive
and
visited
inland
town
on
the
island
is
an
oasis
of
greenery
on
this
barren
island
Although
the
riverbed
here
is
almost
perpetually
dry
the
town
is
fortunate
to
have
high
water
table
Because
of
its
theoretical
invulnerability
at
the
heart
of
the
island
it
was
made
Fuerteventuraâs
first
capital
in
the
early
15th
century
However
in
1539
somehow
the
ravaging
Berber
pirates
overcame
the
mountains
(which
still
provide
difficult
drive
today)
and
destroyed
the
original
cathedral
The
present
17th-century
church
Iglesia
de
Santa
MarÃ­a
is
splendid
building
and
hosts
many
interesting
treasures
Look
at
the
unusual
wooden
beams
between
the
flagstones
on
the
floor
the
wooden
altar
and
choir
and
the
decorated
pulpit
Adjacent
to
the
museum
is
leather
factory-cum-shoe-shop
set
in
an
atmospheric
old
building
Wander
round
this
lovely
little
town
and
admire
the
view
from
across
the
bridge
where
there
is
an
unpretentious
restaurant/bar
and
gift
shop
Just
south
of
Betancuria
is
the
neat
and
pretty
village
of
PÃ¡jara
but
stop
at
Antigua
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
is
in
order
This
is
reached
either
by
continuing
on
the
loop
past
Tuineje
or
backtracking
from
Betancuria
and
taking
the
FV-416
across
the
mountains
In
either
event
once
in
AntiguaÂ â
the
islandâs
capital
from
1834â1835Â âÂ you
canât
miss
the
traditional
old
windmill
found
just
to
the
north
of
town
and
this
is
your
destination
Actually
the
Centro
de
Artesania
âMolino
de
Antiguaâ
(Windmill
Crafts
Center)
is
much
more
than
just
that
and
has
something
for
almost
everyoneâs
tastes
Interesting
crafts
and
visit
inside
the
windmill
certainly
but
also
ethnographic
and
archaeological
exhibitions
modern
art
an
audiovisual
room
rooftop
view-
points
and
an
intriguing
cactus
garden
not
to
mention
nice
restaurant
Of
the
coastline
south
of
Puerto
del
Rosario
the
new
cosmopolitan
development
of
El
Castillo
also
known
as
Caleta
de
Fuste
is
of
most
interest
Activities
here
focus
around
the
attractive
horseshoe-shaped
beach
(where
windsurfing
is
particularly
popular
sport)
and
the
well-designed
marina
In
the
marina
there
is
an
area
where
you
can
view
the
fish
that
frequent
its
waters
and
small
number
of
activities
use
the
harbor
as
homeport
The
Oceanarium
is
catamaran
that
will
take
you
out
to
visit
the
dolphins
and
whales
and
the
Nautilus
is
semi-submersible
submarine
that
has
twenty
individual
seats
The
South
The
main
attraction
is
the
26-km-
(16-mile-)
long
sandy
shores
of
JandÃ­a
that
run
from
the
narrowest
part
of
Fuerteventura
down
to
Morro
Jable
At
the
northern
tip
of
the
JandÃ­a
sands
are
the
beautiful
beaches
of
Costa
Calma
not
blighted
as
yet
by
over-development
Here
low
cliff
backing
and
scattering
of
rocks
and
coves
give
the
beach
far
more
character
than
some
of
the
seemingly
endless
stretches
farther
south
The
Playa
de
Sotavento
is
world-famous
as
windsurfing
center
with
activity
focused
on
the
F2
school
at
the
Sol
Elite
Gorriones
Hotel
This
has
one
of
the
best
and
most
isolated
beach
locations
in
all
of
the
islands
Here
the
beach
is
very
wide
and
flat
usually
empty
and
as
the
tides
go
out
also
very
wet
The
dunes
behind
and
little
farther
to
the
south
form
an
idyllic
beach
backdrop
Urbanizaciones
spread
relentlessly
all
the
way
down
the
coast
to
Morro
Jable
which
has
some
similarities
with
its
northern
sister
Corralejo;
both
are
ports
and
resorts
but
in
most
other
aspects
are
quite
dissimilar
Whereas
Corralejo
is
flat
rather
dingy
without
many
hotels
and
restaurants
of
much
class
and
doesnât
have
much
of
its
own
beach
Morro
Jable
built
along
the
cliffs
is
bright
and
airy
boasts
numerous
fine
hotels
and
restaurants
and
has
miles
of
wonderful
beaches
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
while
Corralejo
is
mainly
British
resort
Morro
Jable
on
the
other
hand
is
frequented
predominantly
by
Germans
There
are
more
fine
beaches
towards
the
southern
tip
of
the
island
but
you
will
need
four-wheel-drive
vehicle
to
get
there
Jable
incidentally
is
the
name
given
to
the
huge
quantities
of
sands
of
organic
origins
that
are
frequently
blown
to
the
surrounding
beaches
Windsurfing
obviously
is
all
the
rage
around
here
and
numerous
companies
operate
in
and
around
Morro
Jable
and
the
other
beaches
of
JandÃ­a
The
Diving
Center
FÃ©lix
(3
Km
{2
miles}
north
of
Morro
Jable)
offers
dives
and
equipment
rental
Consider
Unisafari;
based
in
either
JandÃ­a
or
Corralejo
whose
professional
guides
will
take
you
on
seven-hour
jeep
safari
to
the
most
wild
least
explored
parts
of
the
island
What
to
Do
this
liveliest
of
all
German

Whatever
the
vagaries
of

politics
Berlin
has
never
relinquished
its
role
as
national
capital
in
the
realm
of
the
arts
or

Music
Symphonic
music
in
Berlin
is
fueled
by
three
of
the
worldâs
greatest
orchestras
The
Berliner
Philharmoniker
housed
in
the
Philharmonie
(see
page
40)
achieved
glory
under
the
late
Herbert
von
Karajan
The
highly
rated
Radio
Symphony
Orchestra
Berlin
and
Berlin
Symphony
Orchestra
also
perform
there
while
Schinkelâs
beautifully
restored
Schauspielhaus
on
Gendarmenmarkt
(known
as
the
Konzerthaus
Berlin)
is
another
important
venue
for
classic
music
performances
Chamber
music
and
Lieder
(song)
recitals
take
place
in
the
Kammermusiksaal
(at

Berlinâs
opera
lovers
are
well-served
by
the
Deutsche
Oper
in
BismarckstraÃe
the
Staatsoper
Unter

and
the
Komische

in
BehrenstraÃe
Major

performed
in
big

such
as
the
Max-Schmeling-Halle
the
Velodrom
the
open-air
WaldbÃ¼hne
and

Jazz
is
particularly
popular
in
Berlin
One
of
the
most
famous

Theater
When
it
comes
to
theater
Berlin
is
one
of
the
most
exciting
and
innovative
cities
in
Europe
and
all
the
world
so
that
even
without
great
command
of
the
German
language
any
enthusiastic
theatergoer
can
enjoy
some
stirring
performances
In
Germany
major
theaters
often
maintain
several
productions
in
repertory
so
that
in
any
one
week
you
will
be
able
to
see
the
same
troupe
perform
contemporary
or
classical
drama
There
are
over
150
theaters
in
the
city
so
thereâs
vast
range
to
choose
from
The
cityâs
most
audacious
and
versatile
repertory
is
based
at
the
SchaubÃ¼hne
(Kuâdamm
and
Lehninerplatz)
It
achieved
international
renown
for
its
almost
brutally
uncompromising
performances
of
classical
avant-garde
and
experimental
theater
The
plays
of
Berlinâs
best-known
playwright
Bertolt
Brecht
naturally
dominate
the
repertory
of
the
theater
he
founded
the
world-renowned
Berliner
Ensemble
(Bertolt-Brecht-Platz
1)
although
it
does
expand
to
other
mostly
modern
classics
and
promises
to
further
enhance
its
outstanding
reputation
under
the
new
artistic
director
Claus
Peymann
Contemporary
plays
are
staged
at
the
Maxim-Gorki-Theater
(Am
Festungsgraben
2)
and
the
classics
at
the
Deutsches
Theater
(SchumannstraÃe

not
to
be
sneezed
at

Other
entertainment
Another
long-standing
Berlin
tradition
at
its
heyday
in
the
1920s
satirical
cabaret
has
always
by
its
very
nature
had
to
struggle
for
its
existence
Berlin
has
seemed
to
provide
the
necessary
raw
material
perennially
turbulent
history
to
which
reunification
has
not
put
stop
Two
survivors
among
the
countless
fly-by-nights
are
Die
Stachelschweine
(The
Porcupines
Europa-Center)
and
Die
Distel
(The
Thistle
FriedrichstraÃe
101)
However
unless
your
German
is
excellent
and
you
have
an
in-depth
understanding
of
the
political
scene
this
kind
of
cabaret
will
be
almost
impossible
to
follow
Nightclubs
range
from
garish
girlie
shows
to
conventional
discos
In
between
are
the
transvestite
shows
which
can
be
saucy
often
witty
occasionally
outrageous
but
only
rarely
offensive
They
offer
an
amusing
perspective
of
Berlinâs
past
with
their
impersonations
of
the
great
Marlene
Dietrich
and
other
such
figures
As
befits

International
Film
Festival
Berlin
is
endowed
with
huge
number
of
cinemas
showing
variety
of
films
ranging
from
the
usual
Hollywood
blockbusters
to
avant-garde
works
of
art
Most
foreign-language
films
are
usually
dubbed
into
German
though
some
cinemas
will
occasionally
show
films
in
the
original
language
The
letters
to
look
for
are
âOFâ
(OriginalfassungÂ âÂ original

Sports
Thanks
to
its
many
lakes
and
rivers
Berlin
does
not
lack
opportunities
for
swimming
and
has
around
20
beaches
most
of
them
pleasantly
sandy
Continuing
the
old
Prussian
devotion
to
physical
culture
few
of
the
beaches
are
reserved
for
nude
bathingÂ âÂ or
FKK
as
you
may
see
it
signposted
The
most
popular
of
these
beaches
are
the
Bullenwinkel
on
the
Grunewaldsee
and
Strandbad
Halensee
on
the
Teufelssee
If
you
would
rather
wear
swimsuit
try
the
lovely
beaches
of
the
Wannsee
Glienicker
See
the
Havel
or
the
less
crowded
GroÃer
MÃ¼ggelsee
in
eastern
Berlin
and
Templiner
See
out
at
Potsdam
Berlinâs
sports
facilities
are
second
to
none
thanks
to
the
huge
program
of
building
that
took
place
as
part
of
the
cityâs
bid
for
the
2000
Olympics
There
are
over
1,500
sports
venues
in
the

most
impressive
of
which
are
the
Max-Schmeling-Halle
and
the

was
once
for

Where
to
Go
Barcelona
is
best
approached
by
neighborhood
or
perhaps
theme
You
can
set
out
to
see
the
Gothic
Quarter
MontjuÃ¯c
hill
or
the
waterfront;
or
you
can
create
greatest-hits
tour
of
GaudÃ­
and
his
fellow
Modernista
architects
Itâs
tempting
to
try
to
sandwich
everything
into
just
couple
of
days
but
be
sure
to
leave
time
in
your
schedule
to
get
sidetracked
in
colorful
food
market
or
an
alley
of
antiques
shops
or
to
peek
in
quiet
courtyard
Take

Barcelonans
do

In
the
old
town
where
many
streets
are
too
narrow
for
cars
and
slow
pace
is
amply
rewarded
with
the
discovery
of
hidden
treasures
the
best
way
to
travel
is
on

Each
district
of
the
old
quarterÂ âÂ Barri
GÃ²tic
La
Ribera
Las

of
the

itâs
best
to
make
use
of
Barcelonaâs
excellent
public
transportation
networkÂ âÂ clean
and
efficient
metro

modern

La
Rambla
To
call
La
Rambla
mere
street
is
to
do
it
woeful
injustice
Barcelonaâs
most
famous
boulevardÂ âÂ energetic
artistic
democratic
and
indulgentÂ âÂ is
an
intoxicating
parade
of
humanity
Youâll
no
doubt
want
to
sample
it
several
times
during
your
stay
(maybe
even
several
times
day)
in
Barcelona
It
is
most
crowded
just
before
the
lunch
hour
and
in
the
early
evening
on
weekdays
and
at
dusk
on
weekends
though
it
is
never
deserted
In
the
wee
wee
hours
itâs
populated
by
sometimes
motley
mix
of
early-morning
newspaper
sellers
streetsweepers
and
bar
hounds
stumbling
back
to
their
apartments
and

(see

to
the

La
Rambla
takes
its
name
from
an
Arabic
word
meaning
sandy
dry
river
bed
It
was
shallow
gully
until
the
14th
century
when
Barcelona
families
began
to
construct
homes
nearby
As
the
area
became
more
populated
the
stream
was
soon
paved
over
To
the
north
of
Las
Ramblas
(left
as
you
walk
down
it)
is
the
old

Ciutat
Vella;
to
the
south
or

is
El
Raval
The
five
sections
of
La

change
in
character
as
they
do
in

as
you

along
The

On
Sundays
and

youâll

the

where
you
can
buy

stock
of
foreign

as
well
as
books
reflection
of
Barcelonaâs
status
as
Spainâs

Youâll
also
see
the
first
of
La

celebrated
mimes
or
âhuman
statues,â
portraying
Christopher
Columbus
priests
bearded
nuns
and

among
many
other
guises
Next
up
is
Rambla
dels
Estudis
popularly
called
Rambla
dels
Ocells
(âof

here
the

narrows
to

winged
creatures
of

are
sold

great
attractions
and
constant
in
the
life
of
Barcelonans:
the
Mercat
de
Sant
Josep
also
called
La
BoquerÃ­a
This
19th-century
covered
market
is
an
overflowing
cornucopia
of
delights
for
the

fresh
fish;
meats;
sausages;
fruits
and
vegetables;
and
all
kinds
of
spices
neatly
braided
ropes
of
garlic
sun-dried
tomatoes
and
peppers
preserves
and
sweetmeats
to
make

La
Boqueria
is
also
startlingly
vibrant
community
where
shoppers
and
merchants
greet
each
other
by
name
ribald
sallies
across
the
aisles
set
off
gales
of
laughter
and
the
freshness
of
the
rape
(an
angler
fish
popular
in
Catalonia)
is
debated
with
the
passion
of
traffic

The
huge
market
is
laid
out
under
high-ceilinged
ironwork
naves
like

Restaurants
in
and
near
the
market
are
like
first-aid
stations
for
those
who

faint
with
hunger
at
the
sight
of
such
bounty
The
market
opens
before
dawn

closes
down
by

is
Palau
GÃ¼ell
the
mansion
GaudÃ­
(see
page

built
in
1885
for
his
principal
patron
the
textile
tycoon
Count
Eusebi
GÃ¼ell
This
meticulously
detailed
fortress-like
home
study
in
high
Gothic
is
now
open
for
guided
tours
Visitors
get
to
see
the
fabulously
tiled
rooftop
chimneys
which
were
hidden
from
view
for
decades
Returning
to
the
Ramblas
cross
over
and
follow
the
short
passage
that
leads
into
the
arcaded
PlaÃ§a
Reial
This
handsome
and
spacious
square
is
graced
with
fountain
palm
trees
and
wrought-iron
lamp-posts
designed
by
the
young
GaudÃ­
Like
the
BoquerÃ­a
the
Hotel
Oriente
and
other
Rambla
landmarks
this
square
came
into
being
as
result
of
the
destruction
of
convent
when
church
properties
were
expropriated
in
an
anti-clerical
period
in
the
mid-19th
century
Not
long
ago
it
was
the
stomping
grounds
of
junkies
and
petty
thieves
but
it
has
been
since
revitalized
and
is
flush
with
bars
cafÃ©s
and
restaurants
The
final
promenade
leading
down
to
the
harbor
is
the
short
Rambla
de
Santa
MÃ²nica
beginning
at
the
PlaÃ§a
del
Teatre
site
of
the
run-down
Teatre
Principal
Though
the
Centre
dâArt
Santa
MÃ²nica
puts
on
fine
contemporary
art
exhibits
the
area
continues
to
be
the
beat
of
prostitutes
and
cops
pickpockets
and
bag-snatchers
The
warren
of
alleys
to
the
right
is
the
once-notorious
Barri
Xino
or
Chinatown
With
the
new
openness
of
the
post-Franco
era
it
has
lost
much
of
its
seedy
interest
but
itâs
still
not
the
best
place
for
midnight
stroll
Carrer
dels
Escudellers
busy
pedestrian
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
Rambla
is
the
gateway
to
district
of
cabarets
bars
flamenco
shows
and
restaurants
and
the
delights
of
the
Gothic
Quarter
Nearer
the
port
passage
leads
to
the
Museu
de
Cera
(Wax
Museum)
tourist
trap
with
collection
of
some
three
hundred
realistic
wax
effigies
The
Rambla
ends
at
the
broad
open
space
facing
the
Monument
Colom
statue
honoring
the
discoverer
Christopher
Columbus
(Colom
in
Catalan)
that
can
be
climbed
for
good
views
of
the
port
Poor
Columbus
is
supposed
to
be
indicating
the
way
to
the
riches
of
the
New
World
but
heâs
actually
pointing
at
Mallorca
or
perhaps
North
Africa
Just
beyond
the
statue
is
Barcelonaâs
newly
revitalized
waterfront
Barri
GÃtic
From
its
beginnings
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
Barcelona
has
grown
outwards
in
rings
like
concentric
ripples
on
pond
The
ancient
core
is
hill
the
Romans
called
Mons
Taber
where
they
raised
temple
to
Augustus
Caesar
and
in
the
fourth
century
a.d
built
high
walls
about
mile
around
to
protect
their
settlement
This
is
the
nucleus
of
the
medieval
district
called
the
Barri
GÃ²tic
While
much
of
it
is
not
technically
Gothic
it
is
remarkable
concentration
of
medieval
palaces
convents
and
churches
The
best
place
to
begin
tour
of
the
quarter
is
the
CatedralÂ âÂ Barcelonaâs
superb
cathedral
which
is
the
neighborhoodâs
major
site
and
focal
point
The
cathedral
was
begun
in
1298
on
the
site
of
earlier
churches
going
back
to
Visigothic
times
The
final
touchÂ âÂ the
rather
florid
Gothic
faÃ§adeÂ âÂ was
not
completed
until
the
end
of
the
19th
century
and
thus
contrasts
with
the
simple
octagonal
towers
The
ribs
of
the
cathedralâs
high
vault
are
joined
at
carved
and
painted
keystone
medallions
typically
Catalan
feature
In
the
center
of
the
nave
is
splendid
Gothic
choir
with
lacy
spires
of
carved
wood
Above
these
are
the
heraldic
emblems
of
the
European
kings
and
princes
invited
by
Charles
to
be
members
of
his
exclusive
Order
of
the
Golden
Fleece
(Toison
dâOr)
The
first
and
only
meeting
was
held
in
the
cathedral
in
1519
The
seats
reserved
for
Henry
VIII
of
England
and
FranÃ§ois
of
France
are
next
to
the
emperorâs
but
they
didnât
bother
to
come
Connected
to
the
choir
is
pulpit
with
an
exceptional
wrought-iron
stair
rail
Ahead
steps
under
the
altar
lead
to
the
alabaster
tomb
of
Santa
EulÃ lia
one
of
the
cityâs
two
patron
saints
martyred
in
the
fourth
century
On
the
wall
of
the
right
aisle
are
the
tombs
of
Count
RamÃ³n
Berenguer
and
his
wife
Almodis
who
founded
the
earlier
cathedral
on
this
spot
in
1058Â âÂ each
was
apparently
very
short
Donât
miss
the
Catalan
Gothic
altarpieces
in
the
chapels
behind
the
altar;
the
nine
panels
of
the
Transfiguration
painted
for
the
San
Benito
chapel
in
the
15th
century
by
Bernat
Martorell
are
considered
his
masterpiece
The
leafy
cloister
is
lively
refuge
with
birds
fluttering
among
the
orange
magnolia
and
palm
trees
that
entirely
fill
its
center
Watch
where
you
walk
as
the
cloister
is
paved
with
tombstones
badly
worn
but
many
still
bearing
the
emblems
of
the
bootmakers
tailors
and
other
craft
guilds
whose
wealth
helped
pay
for
the
cathedral
From
the
cloister
pass
to
the
Capella
de
Santa
LlÃºcia
chapel
with
13th-
and
14th-century
tombstones
on
the
floor
and
monument
to
crusader
knight
in
armor
on
one
wall
Leaving
the
chapel
by
its
front
entrance
turn
left
at
carrer
del
Bisbe
Irurita
The
corner
house
at
Number
was
until
recently
the
official
residence
of
the
president
of
the
Generalitat
Train
your
eyes
upwards
as
you
walk
through
the
old
town
to
take
in
the
details
e.g.
curious
hanging
sign
lantern
or
an
unusual
sculpture
On
the
right
youâll
find
row
of
gargoyles
leaning
from
the
roof
of
the
Palau
de
la
Generalitat
the
seat
of
government
for
the
Autonomous
Region
of
Catalonia
and
richly
ornamented
gateway
The
lacy
overhead
bridge
is
Gothic
only
in
style;
itâs
actually
1929
addition
Just
ahead
is
the
spacious
serious
PlaÃ§a
de
Sant
Jaume
the
heart
of
the
Barri
GÃ²tic
local
joke
says
that
the
farthest
distance
in
Barcelona
is
across
this
square
which
separates
the
often
antagonistic
and
conservative
Generalitat
from
the
more
progressive
municipal
authorities
in
the
Ajuntament
(City
Hall)
Architecturally
though
the
two
buildings
make
harmonious
pair:
both
have
classical
faÃ§ades
that
hide
their
Gothic
origins
To
visit
either
building
youâll
need
luck
and
planning;
the
Generalitat
can
only
be
visited
on
23
April
(Day
of
St
George)
and
the
Ajuntament
only
with
an
organized
group
and
by
appointment
(see

The
Palau
de
la
Generalitat
on
the
north
side
of
the
square
(closer
to
the
Cathedral)
is
the
more
interesting
of
the
palaces
This
institution
dates
from
1359
when
it
was
made
the
executive
branch
reporting
to
the
parliament
the
Corts
of
Catalanes
The
nucleus
of

building
is
the
main

Catalan
Gothic
with
an
open
staircase
leading
to
gallery
of

The
Ajuntament
or
Casa
de
la
Ciutat
across
the
plaza
has
held
Barcelonaâs
city
hall
since
1372
It
was
here
that
the
Consell
de
Cent
council
of
100
notable
citizens
met
to
deal
with
civic
affairs
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
king

entrance
can
be

leads
to
the
upper
gallery
of
the
old
courtyard
and
to
the
SalÃ³
de
Cent
(Hall
of
the
One
Hundred)
Its
high
ceiling
resembles
the
barrel-vault
of
the
SalÃ³
del
Tinell
and
was
built
at
about
the
same
time
in
the
14th
century
The
red-and-yellow
bars
of
Cataloniaâs
flag
decorate
the

of

Barcelona
The
church
is
one
of
the
oldest
in
the
city
though
often
remodeled
It
is
said
that

is
PlaÃ§a

The
Roman
defenses
were
meters
(30

high
and
3.5
meters
(12
feet)
thick
and
were
marked
at
intervals
by
towers
18
meters
(59

tall
Until
1943
most
of
this
section
was
covered
by
clutter
of
old
houses
which
were
dismantled
and
relocated
to
restore
the
walls
and
old
mansions
to
view
Since
ancient
times
when
two
main
Roman
thoroughfares
intersected
at
the
PlaÃ§a
de
Sant
Jaume
this
has
been
the
crossroads
of
Barcelona
Streets

The
carrer
del

leads
into
the
labyrinth
of
narrow
streets
that
was
the
Call
or
Jewish
Quarter
until
the
Jews
were
expelled
in
1492
Today
the
quarter
is
bustling
corner
of
antiques
shops
and
dealers
of
rare
books
plus
bars
and
restaurants
frequented
by
antiquarians
and

Although
many
of
the
streets
retain
the
word
Call
in
their
names
there
are
few
vestiges
left
of
the
ghetto
which
once
was
surrounded

Barcelonaâs
Jews
though
noted
as
doctors
scholars
and
jewelers
and
despite
their
financing
of
the
conquests
of
the
crown
were
confined
to
this
district
and
forced
to
wear
long-hooded
cloaks
with
yellow
headband
Taxation
of
the
community
was
special
source
of
royal
income
This
did
not
however
save
the
Call
from
being
burned
and
looted
as
persecution
mounted
in
the
14th
and
15th
centuries

from

favored
such

as
an
inexpensive

flanked
by
two
three-tiered

breathtaking
Fires
set
during

of
1936
at
the
outbreak
of
the
Civil
War
tragically
consumed
all
the
trappings
of

the
interior
stripped
to
its

The
result
is
capacious
lofty

suffused
with
soft
light
from
the
stained-glass
windows
Three
tall
naves
are
supported
by
slim
octagonal

13
meters
(43
feet)

the
Passeig

rustic-looking
plaza
where
jousts
were
held
in
the
Middle
Ages
and
fairs

festivals
take
place
today
Many
of
the
little
streets
surrounding
the
church
are
named
for
the
craftsmen
who
once
had
their
shops
here
or
their
products:
Sombrerers
(hatmakers)
Mirallers
(mirror-makers)
EsparterÃ­a
(makers
of
rope-soled
shoes)
and
EspaserÃ­a
(sword-makers)
Today
the
area
is
better
known
for
the
merry-makers
who
swarm
its
bars
late
into
the
night
and
spill
out
onto
the
streets;
disgruntled
residents
hang
signs
from

One
of
Barcelonaâs
grandest
medieval
streets
Carrer
Montcada
populated
by
aristocrats
from
the
14th
to
the
16th
centuries
is
lined
with
Gothic
palaces
each
with
an
imposing
door
or
arched
gate
to
an
inner
court
where
an
ornamental
staircase
usually
led
up
to
reception
rooms
These
mansions
were
gradually
abandoned
after
the
demolition
of
the
adjoining
district
and
construction
of
the
Ciutadella
fortress
The

decayed
gently
without

leaving
it
the
most
authentically
medieval
part
of
the
city
The
Museu
Picasso
recently
enlarged
in
grand
fashion
is
housed
in
the
Palau
Aguilar
15th-century
mansion
It
and
the
Palau
Castellet
next-door
were
acquired
by
the
city
to
house
the
collection
of
paintings
drawings
and
ceramics
donated
by
Picassoâs
lifelong
friend
and
secretary
Jaume
SabartÃ©s
Three
more
Moncada
palaces
have
been
added
to
the
Picasso
stable;
they
will
hold
temporary
exhibitions
After
the
museum
opened
in
1963
Picasso
added
sketches
and
paintings
from
his
childhood
and
youth
as
well
as
the
famous
44
variations
on
the
theme
of
Las
Meninas
the
VelÃ¡zquez
masterpiece
in
Madridâs
Prado
Museum
Barcelonaâs
collection
is
the
largest
outside
Paris
where
Picasso
lived
and
became
an
international
superstar
after
leaving
Barcelona
The
earliest
works
date
from
Picassoâs
ninth
year
As
teenagerhe
produced
large
canvases
in
the
moralizing
19th-century
realist
manner
such
as
the
First
Communion
and
Science
and
Charity
It
appears
that
as
Picassoâs
talent
developed
he
digested
the
styles
of
the
past
and
of
his
contemporaries
proved
he
could
equal
them
then
forged
energetically
ahead
into
the
future
Though
the
museum
doesnât
possess
any
of
the
masterâs
finest
works
it
does
have
two
good
examples
of
his
âBlue
Periodâ
(1903)
as
well
as
The
Harlequin
(1917)
and
the
idiosyncratic
Las
Meninas
series
which
provides
fascinating
view
of
Picassoâs
innovative
and
deconstructivist
approach
to
his
subject
Across
the
street
is
the
Museu
TÃ¨xtil
de
la
IndumentÃ ria
(Textile
and
Costume
Museum)
in
the
former
palace
of
the
Marqueses
de

The
collection
brings
to
life
the
elegance
enjoyed
by
the
rich
families
who
occupied
the
Montcada
mansions
The
costumes
on

are
of
superb

Palau
de

MÃºsica
Catalana
(on
Sant

de
Paula

The
Palace
of
Catalan
Music
by
LluÃ­s
DomÃ¨nech
Montaner
may
be
the
perfect
(albeit
chaotic)
expression
of
modernisme
It
is
an
explosion
of
mosaics
tiles
stained
glass
enamel
sculpture
and
carvingÂ âÂ a
wildly
audacious
outpouring
of
contours
and
colors
The
brick
exterior
with
Moorish
arches
and
columns
inlaid
with
floral
tile
designs
is
sober
compared
to
whatâs
inside
Even
though
every
square
inch
is
embellished
right
down
to
the
tiles
underfoot
somehow
the
hall
isnât
overpowering
or
claustrophobic
One
of
DomÃ¨nechâs
main
concerns
was
to
let
in
as
much
natural
light
as
possible
and
the
hall
is
indeed
light
and
roomy
The
structural
skeleton
is
ironÂ âÂ an
innovation
in
those
daysÂ âÂ which
allows
the
walls
to
be
of
glass
Sunlight
streaming
in
during
afternoon
concerts
sets
the
place
on
fire
On
either
side
of
the
orchestraâs
stage
the
rich
colors
of
the
room
are
offset
by
two
wildly
sculpted
groups
of
musical
masters
in
white
plaster
Between
these
fevered
creations
of
the
sculptor
Pau
Gargallo
Picassoâs
friend
the
silvery
pipes
of
grand
organ
stand
in
orderly
contrast
Overhead
is
the
Palauâs
crowning
glory
magical
stained
glass
orb
Behind
the
musicians
curved
wall
is
covered
with
mosaics
of
muses
playing
instruments
from
bagpipes
to
castanets
Their
upper
bodies
are
made
of
porcelain
and
seem
to
emerge
magically
from
the
walls
If
this
all
sounds
like
the
recipe
for
nausea
you
simply
have
to
see
it
to
believe
it
The
best
way
to
experience
the
Palau
is
to
attend
concert
The
hall
was
built
in
1908
for
musical
society
called
the
OrfeÃ³
CatalÃ 
but
today
programs
range
from
top
symphony

El
Eixample
Modernisme
The
Eixample
Barcelonaâs
modern
district
north
of
PlaÃ§a
de
Catalunya
is
the
cityâs
main
shopping
and
banking
area
Itâs
where
youâll
want
to
spend
good
portion
of
your
time
if
youâve
been
waiting
for
GaudÃ­
The
neighborhood
is
flush
with
spectacular
apartment
buildings
examples
of
Barcelonaâs
unique
early-20th-century
modernista
architecture
and
is
called
the
Quadrat
dâOr
(Golden
Square)
The
principal
shopping
and
strolling
avenues
are
the
elegant
Passeig
de
GrÃ cia
Barcelonaâs
version
of
the
Champs
dâElysee
and
pedestrian-only
Rambla
de
Catalunya
an
uptown
segment
of
La
Rambla
In
manageable
area
between
the
Gran
VÃ­a
de
les
Corts
Catalanes
and
Avinguda
Diagonal
youâll
find
most
of
the
modernista
masterpieces
Two
of
Barcelonaâs
signature
sights
GaudÃ­âs
unfinished
cathedral
La
Sagrada

and
his

on
the
northern

For
all
of
Barcelonaâs
exuberant
architecture
the
cityâs
modern
district
is
model
of

rigid

dryly
called
âthe
Extension.â
The
outrageous
and
conservative
one
learns
coexist
here
without
much
fuss
Barcelonaâs
expansion
came
about
in
remarkable
burst
of
urban
development
By
the
mid-1800s
Barcelona
was
bursting
at
the
seams
and
suffocating
inside
its
ring
of
medieval
walls
municipal
competition
was
held
in
1859
to
select
plan
for
new
quarter
between
the
old
city
and
the
Collserola
hills
The
job
went
to
road
engineer
named
Ildefons
CerdÃ 
whose
plan
quintupled
the
cityâs
size
in
matter
of
decades
Eixample
construction
by
elite
Barcelonans
transformed
the
city
into
showcase
of
extravagant
modernista
architecture
and
the
swank
Passeig
de
GrÃ cia
became
the
place
to
be
seen
Barcelona
used
the
1888
Universal
Exposition
as
an
open
house
to
show
the
world
its
new
face
The
place
to
begin
modernista
tour
is
definitely
on
Passeig
de
Gracia
and
its
single
hallucinatory
block
popularly
known
as
Manzana
de
la
Discordia
(âBlock
of
Discordâ)
between
Consell
de
Cent
and
AragÃ³
(In
Spanish
the
word
for
âappleâ
and
âstreet
blockâ
are
the
same
Â âÂ manzanaÂ âÂ allowing
for
play
on
words
alluding
to
the
apple
in
Greek
mythology
which
was
awarded
to
the
most
beautiful
among
three
goddessesÂ âÂ a
contest
that
led
inevitablyto

If
you
are
discreet
though
you
can
usually
take
peek
into
the

to

the
antique
elevator
and
wonderful
staircase
GaudÃ­âs
highly
personal
Casa
BatllÃ³
(1904-1906)
is
next
door
The
curvy
contours
unexpected
combinations
of
textures
and
materials
bright
colors
and
infinite
detail
are
GaudÃ­
hallmarks
as
are
his
prevalent
religious
and
nationalist
symbolism
The
Casa
BatllÃ³
is
said
to
pay
tribute
to
the
patron
saint
of
Catalonia
St
George
and
the
dragon
he
valiantly
slayed
GaudÃ­
himself
left
no
clues
as
to
his
intent
The
undulating
blue-tile
roof
indeed
looks
like
dragonâs
scaly
hide
while
the
window
balconies
could
be
the
skulls
and
bones
of
its
victims
(others
have
suggested
that
they
are
Venetian
carnival
masks)
St

GaudÃ­âs

Youâll
likely
be
busy
looking
up

in

when
you
stroll
along
Passeig

GrÃ cia
but
be
sure
to
notice
the
ground
as
well:
GaudÃ­
himself
designed
the
hexagonal
pavement

with
nature
motifs
The
mosaic

and
iron
street
lamps
with
little
bats
(1900)
are

Additional
examples
of

by
other
architects
of
the
period
are
littered
throughout
the
Eixample
and
are
too
numerous
to

here
Have
look
at

youâll
stumble

the

there
are
two
excellent
shops
that
specialize
in

and
are
well
worth
visit
as
much
for
their

as
for
the
spectacular

In
addition
to
Bareclonaâs
modernista
architecture
Passeig
de

(Paseo

in

is
lined
with
outdoor
cafÃ©s

and
elegant
fashion
boutiques
number
of
the
top

are
on
or

this
avenue
The
PlaÃ§a
de
Catalunya
where
the
boulevard
begins
was
designed
to
be
the
cityâs
hub
and
it
certainly
is
lively
if
not
the
most
attractive
space
in
Barcelona
The
bus
metro
and
regional
train
systems
radiate
from
this
square
Parallel
to
Passeig
de
GrÃ cia
is
an
extension
of
the
old
Ramblas
the
Rambla
de
Catalunya
It
is
lined
with
shops
tapas
bars
clothing
boutiques
and
mom-and-pop
stores;
traffic
moves
slowly
down
either
side
but
the
center
is
pedestrian-only
and
is
considerably
more
relaxed
than
the
lower
Ramblas
On
carrer
dâAragÃ³
between
Passeig
de
GrÃ cia
and
Rambla
de
Catalunya
is
the
FundaciÃ³
Antoni
TÃ pies
museum
dedicated
to
the
work
of
Spainâs
foremost
living
artist
the
abstract
materialist
from
Catalonia
In
addition
to
TÃ piesâs
work
the
FundaciÃ³
has
interesting
rotating
international
exhibits
but
at
least
half
the
reason
to
visit
is
to
see
the
gorgeous
1880
DomÃ¨nech
Montaner
building
that
houses
the
museum
(one
of
the
first
examples
of
modernisme)
and
TÃ piesâs
whimsical
tangled
wire
sculpture
(called
âCloud
and
Chairâ)
on
the
roof
La
Sagrada
Familia
What
the
Eiffel
Tower
is
to
Paris
or
the
Statue
of
Liberty
is
to
New
York
the
soaring
spires
of
the
Sagrada
Familia
church
are
to
Barcelona
Its
unmistakable
profile
protruding
from
the
cityâs
crew-cut
skyline
is
visible
from
afar
Yet
the
eight
peculiar
cigar-shaped
towers
are
merely
the
shell
of
church
that
was
begun
in
1882
and
is
still
many
years
from
completion
This
was
Antoni
GaudÃ­âs
life
work
though
he
didnât
really
expect
to
finish
it
in
his
lifetime
He
probably
didnât
expect
to
be
run
over
by
tram
while
working
feverishly
on
it
either
For
many
years
the
church
remained
much
as
it
was
when
GaudÃ­
died
With
the
assistance
of
private
funds
foundation
is
now
trying
to
complete
the
churchÂ âÂ not
an
easy
task
since
GaudÃ­
left
few
detailed
plans
behind
Yet
it
is
known
that
he
meant
for
total
of
10
more
spires
to
be
built
GaudÃ­
who
died
in
1926
at
the
age
of
74
is
appropriately
buried
in
the
churchâs
crypt
During
his
last
years
he
lived
in
room
on
the
construction
site
obsessed
with
the
project
As
indisputably
original
as
La
Sagrada
Familia
is
it
was
not
GaudÃ­âs
work
from
the
very
beginning
He
took
over
the
more
traditionally
Gothic
plans
of
an
earlier
architect
and
supervised
work
on
the
east
Portal
of
the
Nativity
one
tower
and
part
of
the
apse
and
nave
The
west-side
Portal
of
the
Passion
and
its
towers
have
been
under
construction
since
1952
with
builders
using
plans
by
other
architects
emulating
his
style
The
east
faÃ§ade
shows
best
what
GaudÃ­
intended
Everything
has
significance
and
name
and
no
space
is
left
unfilled
The
three
doorways
with
stonework
dripping
like
stalactites
represent
Faith
Hope
and
Charity
and
are
loaded
with
sculptures
depicting
angel
choirs
and
musicians
and
Biblical
episodes
such
as
the
birth
and
youth
of
Jesus
the
Flight
into
Egypt
the
Slaughter
of
the
Innocents
the
Tree
of
Calvary
and
much
much
more
The
cathedral
is
intended
to
incorporate
every
aspect
of
creation
and
faith
Twelve
towers
four
at
each
portal
are
to
represent
the
Apostles;
four
higher
ones
the
Evangelists;
dome
over
the
apse
the
Virgin;
and
the
central
spire
the
Savior
Both
an
elevator
and
steps
give
access
to
lookout
from
one
of
the
east
towers
On
the
west
side
is
modern
sculptural
interpretation
much
criticized
that
has
galvanized
those
who
believed
the
temple
should
have
been
left
as
it
was
unfinished
as
tribute
to
the
great
GaudÃ­
Nevertheless
onward
it
goes
Â âÂ when
it
will
be
finished
nobody
knows
For
now
and
perhaps
the
generation
to
come
the
great
spires
are
marred
by
ever-present
scaffolding
and
cranes
short
walk
diagonally
from
La
Sagrada
Familia
is
the
astonishing
Hospital
de
la
Santa
Creu
Sant
Pau
designed
by
DomÃ¨nech
Montaner
(architect
of
the
Palau
de
la
MÃºsica
Catalana)
and
completed
by
his
son
The
complex
of
buildingsÂ âÂ still
working
hospitalÂ âÂ is
one
of
modernismeâs
most
underrated
(and
least
known)
achievements

this

it

to
visit:

GaudÃ­âs

Eusebi
GÃ¼ell
bought
hectares
(15
acres)
here
overlooking
the
city
and
the
sea
intending
to
create
community
of
villas
He
gave
GaudÃ­
carte
blanche
to
produce
something
original
and
for
the
next
14
years
on
and
off
the
architect
delighted
in
letting
his
imagination
run

Ceilings
are

Beneath
the

is
the
SalÃ³
de

(Hall

There

in
what
was
to
have
been
the

If

youâll
see

stuck
in

Waterfront
Barceloneta
Barcelona
turned
its
back
on
the
sea
in
the
19th
century
and
focused
on
developing
industry
The
sea
wall
where
families
loved
to
walk
and
catch
the
breeze
on
stifling
summer
nights
was
dismantled
Access
to
and
even
view
of
the
sea
was
obstructed
by
warehouses
and
railway
tracks
Expansion
proceeded
towards
the
hills
and
La
Barceloneta
neighborhood
created
in
the
mid-1700s
between
the
port
and
the
beach
became
the
district
of
modest
fishermen
and
sailors
Now
all
this
has
changed
again
and
recreational
(and
increasingly
commercial)
area
has
been
newly
created
along
the
waterfront
Begin

the

Cataloniaâs
dominion
over

from

The

In
the
area
across
between
La

which
fronts
the

just
south
of
Barceloneta
the
most
remarkable
institution
is
La
Llotja
center
of
Barcelonaâs
trading
activities
for
more
than
600
years
It
started
out
as
an
open
loggia
where
merchants
and
ship
owners
made
their
deals
In
the
late
14th
century
this
was
enclosed
and
expanded
to
three
naves
of
slim
columns
supporting
high
round
arches
Here
was
installed
the
office
of
âConsulate
of
the
Sea,â
the
foundation
of
maritime
law
for
all
the
Mediterranean
countries
With
the
addition
of
neo-Classical
faÃ§ade

the
building
served
variously
as
Chamber
of

and
School
of

spaces
The
best
way
to
venture
into
the
barrio
is
to
start
on
the
Ramblas
turning
west
on
carrer
del
Carme
On
the
site
of
the
Gothic
complex
of
the
Hospital
de
la
Santa
Creu
(Hospital
of
the
Holy
Cross)
hospital
and
refuge
for
pilgrims
stood
for
thousand
years
GaudÃ­
died
here
in
1926
The
present
structures
were
begun
in
1401
Look
for
the
frieze
of
16th-century
tiles
on
the
life
of
St
Paul
in
the
entryway
of
the
Institut
dâEstudis
Catalans
The
hospitalâs
courtyard
is
restful
with
benches
near
orange
trees
ripe
with
fruit
in
summer
Exhibitions
of
art
and
books
are
held
in
the
various
halls
off
the
cloister
Turn
north
from
here
up
the
carrer
del
Ãngels
and
you
will
reach
the
most
conspicuous
symbol
of
the
transformation
underway
in
this
neighborhood:
Richard
Meierâs
shockingly
modern
and
blindingly
white
Museu
dâArt
Contemporani
de
Barcelona
known
by
its
initials
MACBA
Erected
as
counterpoint
to
the
rest
of
the
barrio
and
as
the
lead
dog
in
the
municipal
governmentâs
plans
to
upgrade
this
artistâs
neighborhood
the
stark
museum
is
worth
visiting
primarily
for
architecture
buffs
It
is
still
working
on
putting
together
serious
contemporary
collection
Next
door
on
carrer
Montalegre
is
the
Centre
de
Cultura
ContemporÃ nia
de
Barcelona
striking
modern
makeover
of
an
old
hospital
the
Casa
de
Caritat
It
displays
interesting
exhibits
that
posit
Barcelona
or
the
urban
experience
as
their
theme
One
more
building
on
this
side
of
the
Ramblas
that
should
not
be
missed
is
the
small
church
of
Sant
Pau
del
Camp
off
in
corner
of
its
own
at
the
end
of
the
carrer
de
Sant
Pau
which
starts
at
the
Pla
de
la
BoquerÃ­a
The
simplicity
of
Sant
Pauâs
Romanesque
lines
is
an
agreeable
change
from
the
extravagance
of
Barcelonaâs
modernisme
and
the
intricacies
of
Gothic
architecture
The
church
was
almost
certainly
built
in
the
ninth
century
as
evidenced
by
the
tomb
of
Wilfred
II
dated
912
that
was
found
here
The
small
lovely
cloister
has
curious
rather
Arab-style
arches
The
church
usually
remains
locked;
the
best
time
to
see
the
interior
is
on
Sunday
morning
MontjuÃ¯c
MontjuÃ¯c
was
the
natural
site
for
the
1992
Olympic
Ring
(Anella
OlÃ­mpica)
of
athletic
facilities
For
many
years
its
210-meter
(689-foot)
summit
panoramic
view
of
the
city
and
harbor
and
outstanding
complex
of
museums
amusement
attractions
and
sports
facilities
have
made
the
hill
favorite
place
to
spend
an
afternoon
MontjuÃ¯c
came
into
its
own
as
the
site
of
Barcelonaâs
1929
International
Exhibition
The
PlaÃ§a
dâEspanyaâs
ornate
fountain
was
created
to
grace
the
entrance
to
the
fairground
and
is
still
good
point
to
begin
visit
to
MontjuÃ¯c

one
of
the
worldâs
finest
collections
of
medieval
art
the
Museu
Nacional
dâArt
de
Catalunya
Unmatched
for
Romanesque
art
and
Gothic
painting
of
the
Catalan
school
it
has
undergone
extensive
refurbishment
over
recent
years
and
the
section
on
Romanesque
art
is
now
finally
reopened
From
the
ninth
to
the
13th
centuries
more
than
2,000
churches
were
built
in
Catalonia
in
the
Romanesque
style
of
thick
bare
walls
with
rounded
arches
for
doors
windows
and
cloisters
Interiors
were
decorated
with
frescoes
in
the
Byzantine
tradition;
primitive
sculpture
of
biblical
episodes
or
rural
life
on
the
capitals
of
columns;
painted
altar
front
panels;
carved
wooden
crosses
and
Madonnas
of
great
purity
Around
the
start
of
the
20th
century
many
of
these
works
of
art
were
removed
to
Catalan
museums
from
churches
that
were
deteriorating
or
abandoned
thus
saving
them
from
further
damage
or
being
sold
out
of
the
country
Some
of
Spainâs
very
best
works
of
art
are
in
this
museum
such
as
the
great
12th
century
Cristo
Pantocrator
from
the
apse
of
the
church
of
Sant
Climent
de
TaÃ¼ll
in
the
Pyrenees
superb
group
of
unpainted
elongated
wooden
figures
representing
the
descent
from
the
cross
is
from
the
church
of
Santa
MarÃ­a
de
TaÃ¼ll
There
are
masterpieces
in
every
room
of
this
most
unusual
collection
The
Gothic
wing
is
excellent
too
Many
of
the
paintings
are
retablos
many-paneled
screens
with
Gothic-arched
frames
that
stood
behind
chapel
altars
Among
the
treasures
are
LluÃ­s
Dalmauâs
Virgin
of
the
Councillors
with
its
portraits
full
of
character
of
the
politicos
who
commissioned
the
work
for
the
City
Hall
chapel
in
1445;
Jaume
Ferrer
IIâs
stylishly
hatted
St
Jerome;
and
very
fine
retable
of
St
John
the
Baptist
with
saints
Sebastian
and
Nicholas
Up
the
hill
and
across
the
street
is
the
Museu
ArqueolÃ²gic
(Archaeological
Museum)
Among
the
many
interesting
exhibits
drawn
mainly
from
prehistoric
Iberian
Greek
and
Roman
sites
in
Catalonia
are
reconstructions
of
tombs
and
life-like
dioramas
Around
another
curve
within
walking
distance
up
the
hill
is
the
Museu
EtnolÃ²gic
(Ethnological
Museum)
This
well-presented
collection
usually
has
special
rotating
program
highlighting
the
native
arts
of
Latin

and
other
lands

FundaciÃ³
Joan
MirÃ³
The
museum
was
designed
in
1975
by
the
architect
Josep
LluÃ­s
Sert
to
house
large
collection
of
paintings
drawings
tapestries
and
sculpture
by
the
Catalan
surrealist
MirÃ³
died
in
1983
at
the
age
of
90
The
exhibits
follow
MirÃ³âs
artistic
development
from
1914
onwards
Photographs
show
him
always
neatly
dressed
and
barbered
looking
like
Catalan
businessman
in
contrast
to
the
more
bohemian
Picasso
and
in
contrast
too
with
the
surrealist
works
he
created
The
collection
is
witty
and
bright
with
the
bright
colors
and
unique
language
symbols
associated
with
the
artist
The

The
fortress
atop
MontjuÃ¯c
built
in
1640
remained
in
use
by
the
army
and
then
as
prison
until
shortly
before
it
was
turned
over
to
the
city
to
become
museum
in
1960
The
Museu

has
an
extensive
collection
of
antique

and
armor
lead
soldiers
of
different

and
models
of
Catalan

youâll
find
what
may
be
the
only
statue
of
GeneralÃ­ssimo
Francisco
Franco
to
be
seen
in
Barcelona
today
The
fort
has
somber
associations
for
the
city:
Its
cannons
bombarded
the
population
to
put
down
rebellions
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
and
it
was
the
site
of
political
executions
including
that
of
LluÃ­s
Companys
president
of
the
Generalitat
of
Catalonia
during
the
Civil
War
who
was
shot
by
firing
squad
in
1940
The
Olympic
facilities
on
the
northern
side
of
MontjuÃ¯c
are
centered
on
the
stadium
and
PlaÃ§a
dâEuropa
The
original
1929
stadium
now
called
Estadi
OlÃ­mpic
was
enlarged
for
the
1992
Summer
Games
The

The
Poble
Espanyol
(Spanish

on
MontjuÃ¯câs
northeastern
flank
is
an
attraction
for
which
the
clichÃ©
âfun
for
the
whole
familyâ
might
have
been
invented
Built
in
1929
for
the
Barcelona
Universal
Exposition
itâs
composite
of
architecture
representing
Spainâs
varied
regions
including
replicas
of
houses
church
towers
fountains
plazas
and
palaces
built
of
solid
brick
and
stone
The
entrance
through
one
of
the
gates
of
the
walled
city
of
Ãvila
is
the
first
step
into
community
of
115
such
reproductions
arranged
along
network
of
18
streets
and
alleys
and
11
village
squares
Itâs
bit
cheeky
and
full
of
tour-bus
crowds
but
at
least
gives
you
notion
of
the
different
regions
of
Spain
That
said
thereâs
plenty
to
entertain
children
Architecture

wonât
want
to

the
PabellÃ³
Mies

pavilion
built
for
the
1929
International

The

The
broad
tree-lined
Avinguda
Diagonal
slices
across
CerdÃ âs
grid
from
the

to
the

Designed
for
through

it
links
up
with
the

beyond
The
area
around
the
PlaÃ§a
de
les
GlÃ²ries
Catalanes
busy
roundabout
linking
main
roads
into
the
city
is
largely
industrial
but
becomes
more
dignified
to
the
west
after
crossing
the
Passeig
de
Sant
Joan
Between
the
Passeig
de
GrÃ cia
and
the
PlaÃ§a
de

MaciÃ 
is
one
of
Barcelonaâs
most
elegant

with
four-star
hotels
and

The
districts
on
the
hillside
beyond
were
once
separate
villages
where
residents
of
Barcelona
town
often
spent
summers
and
weekends
Theyâve
been
gradually
absorbed
over
the
years
by
Barcelonaâs
expansion
but
each
still
preserves
its
own
unique
character
GrÃ cia
for
example
has
its
own
town
square
the
PlaÃ§a
Rius
Taulet
and
streets
named
Llibertat
and
Fraternitat
and
PlaÃ§a
RevoluciÃ³
reflecting
political
past
Thereâs
great
night-time
blowout
of
food
and
festivity
in
these
streets
in
the
second
half
of
August
SarriÃ 
retains
the
feel
of
small
Catalan
town
while
the
atmosphere
of
Pedralbes
is
patricianÂ âÂ residential
villas
with
gardens
and
the
cityâs
most
expensive
real

The
Monestir

Pedralbes
in
Pedralbes
has
superb
Gothic
church
with
charming
two-story

Tibidabo
The
first
bright
clear
morning
or
late
afternoon
of
your
visit
head
for
Tibidabo
the
542-meter
(1,778-foot)
peak
that
overlooks
Barcelona
The
views
of
the
city
are
breathtaking
You
can
clearly
make
out
the
Sagrada
Familia
and
the
grid
plan
of
the
Eixample
Families
come
here
on
summer
evenings
to
enjoy
the
1950s-style
amusement
park
and
weekends
are
crowded
with
joggers
and
cyclists
You
can
also
climb
Torre
de
Collserola
by
the
English
architect
Sir
Norman
Foster
or
visit
the
church
of
the
Sagrat
CorazÃ³n
neo-Gothic
work
by
Enric
Sagnier
the
church
is
surmounted
by
monumental
figure
of
Christ
one
of
the
cityâs
landmarks
To
reach
the
summit
take
the
FCG
train
(not
the
metro)
to
âAvda
Tibidaboâ
from
the
PlaÃ§a
de
Catalunya
From
here
Tramvia

runs
daily
in

Saturdays
and
Sundays
the
rest
of
the

taking
you
up
to
the
funicular
station
past
stately
mansions
In
five
minutes
the
funicular
(closed
mid-October
through
February)
lifts
you
through
pine
woods
to
the
top
where
you
have
spectacular
panorama
of
the
city
the
sea
coast
and
on
very
clear
days
both
Mallorca
and
the
Pyrenees
There
are
several
restaurants
and
bars
here
including
Mirablau
with
extraordinary
views
as
their

Excursions
Thereâs
an
awful
lot
to
detain
you
in
Barcelona
but
just
beyond
the
city
are
several
sites
eminently
worthy
of
day
trips
including
the
holy
Catalan
shrine
Montserrat
the
relaxed
beach-
and-museum
town
of
Sitges
and
the
cava
wine
country
in
the
region
of
PenedÃ¨s
Montserrat
The
jagged
ridges
of
Montserrat
rise
out
of
the
rather
featureless
Llobregat
plain
62
kilometers
(38
miles)
northwest
of
Barcelona
in
the
very
heart
of
Catalonia
Although
the
view
from
its
1,235-meter
(4,051-foot)
summit
can
encompass
both
the
Pyrenees
and
Mallorca
it
is
more
significant
that
from
afar
one
can
see
the
unmistakable
outline
that
gives
Montserrat
its
name
âSerrated
Mountain.â
Montserrat
is
the
shrine
of
Catalan
nationhood
The
first
hermitages
on
the
mountain
may
have
been
established
to
escape
the
Moorish
invasion
One
was
enlarged
as
Benedictine
monastery
in
the
11th
century
century
later
it
became
the
repository
of
La
Moreneta
the
Black
Madonna
said
to
be
carving
by
St
Luke
later
hidden
by
St
Peter
Sheâs
small
wooden
image
of
brown-faced
Virgin
holding
the
infant
Jesus
on
her
lap
and
the
globe
in
her
right
hand
Ever
since
pilgrimsâfrom
commoners
to
kingsÂ âÂ have
climbed
the
mountain
to
worship
the
Catalan
patron
saint
More
than
million
pilgrims
and
tourists
visit
each
year
Like
Catalan
nationalism
the
monastery
has
been
destroyed
only
to
rise
again
It
was
burned
to
the
ground
by
Napoleonâs
soldiers
in
1808
abandoned
in
1835
when
all
convents
were
sequestered
by
the
state
and
rebuilt
in
1874
During
the
Spanish
Civil
War
when
anti-clerical
feelings
were
violent
among
the
Republicans
in
Barcelona
La
Moreneta
was
secretly
replaced
by
copy;
the
original
remained
hidden
during
the
Franco
years
Though
Catalan
culture
was
suppressed
Montserratâs
monks
continued
to
say
masses
in
Catalan
The
site
of
the
monastery
is
spectacular
tucked
into
folds
of
rock
high
above
the
plain
On
the
eve
of
the
saintâs
day
27
April
the
monks
hold
an
all-night
vigil
attended
by
crowds
of
people
La
Moreneta
looks
down
from
gold-and-glass
case
above
and
to
the
right
of
the
altar
in
the
basilica
but
the
faithful
can
touch
or
kiss
her
right
hand
through
an
opening
At
1pm
and
7pm
(except
in
July)
the
choir
boys
of
the
EscolanÃ­a
one
of
the
worldâs
oldest
music
schools
founded
in
the
13th
century
fill
the
basilica
with
their
angelic
voices
The
congregation
joins
in
at
the
end
of
the
service
to
sing
Montserratâs
hymn
the
Virolai
an
expression
of
faith
fused
with
nationalist
fervor
Montserrat
is
also
the
goal
of
outdoor
sports
pilgrims
like
cyclists
(who
make
the
trip
from
Barcelona)
and
mountain
climbers
who
ascend
the
spires
of
rock
above
the
monastery
From
the
monastery
there
are
walks
to
other
hermitages
and
funicular
to
the
cave
sacred
to
the
legend
of
the
Madonna
Statues
and
plaques
line
the
paths
Montserrat
is
an
extremely
popular
place
so
there
are
several
bars
and
restaurants
set
up
to

Sitges
Itâs
easy
to
get
to
the
Costa
Daurada
beaches
from
Barcelona
The
coast
south
of
the
city
earned
its
name
from
its
broad
golden
sands
in
contrast
to
the
rocky
coves
of
the
Costa
Brava
to
the
north
Sitges
favorite
resort
of
Barcelonans
is
the
best
site
for
day
trip
Itâs
43-km
(27-mile)
and
45-minute
drive
less
than
half
an
hour
by
train
from
the
cityâs
EstaciÃ³-Sants
The
coastal
drive
is
very
scenic
but
narrow
and
curvy
route
If
you
prefer
you
can
by-pass
this
road
by
taking
the
toll
road
which
gets
you
to
Sitges
in
under
10
minutes
Happily
the
pretty
town
has
escaped
the
high-rises
and
tawdry
atmosphere
of
many
coastal
resorts
although
it
does
get
somewhat
overwhelmed
by
crowds
in
summer
There
are
two
beaches
separated
by
promontory
where
gleaming
whitewashed
houses
cluster
around
the
church
of
Sant
Bartomeu
La
Ribera
is
almost
kilometers
(2
mile)
long
backed
by
promenade
lined
with
cafÃ©s
and
restaurants
Besides
the
beaches
Sitges
is
known
for
its
collection
of
small
appealing
museums
The
Museu
Cau
Ferrat
is
installed
in
the
house
of
the
painter
Santiago
RusiÃ±ol
(1861â1931)
whose
collection
of
works
by
El
Greco
Casas
Picasso
and
others
is
on
display
along
with
many
of
his
own
works
Across
the
street
the
Museu
Maricel
del
Mar
holds
small
collection
of
medieval
sculpture
and
paintings
in
splendid
house
overlooking
the
sea
The
Museu
RomÃ ntic
displays
the
furniture
and
accoutrements
of
wealthy
18th
century
as
well
as
large
family
of
antique
dolls
On
the
hillsides
and
lanes
are
the
villas
of
wealthy
Barcelona
families
while
the
streets
between
the
beach
and
railway
station
are
geared
for
food
and
frolic
In
late
spring
the
streets
are
carpeted
with
flowers
for
the
procession
of
Corpus
Christi
Sitges
is
home
to
one
of
Spainâs
largest
gay
communities
and
is
magnet
for
gay
travelers
year-round

The
Handy

Tips

beginning
on
page

gives
detailed
practical
guidance
but
here
are
some
general
ideas
to
help
you
plan
your
trip
On
first
visit
youâll
probably
be
able
to
get
feel
for
just
few
of
the
regions
we
describe
but
you
can
capture
the
essence
of
Canada
in
judicious
combination
of
two
or
three
major
cities
and
the
marvelous
outdoor
life
We
do
not
attempt
an
encyclopedic
coverage
of
every
nook
and
cranny
from
the
U.S
border
to
the
Arctic
Circle
but
we
do
provide
representative
sample
of
the
countryâs
attractions
Where
Weâve
divided
the
country
into
six
regions
each
with
at
least
one
major
town
accessible
by
air
as
âlaunching
padâ
from
which
to
explore
the
hinterland:
Ontario;
QuÃ©bec;
the
Atlantic
(Newfoundland
and
the
Maritimes);
British
Columbia;
the
Rockies
and
the
Prairie
Provinces
(Alberta
Saskatchewan
and
Manitoba);
and
the
North
(Yukon
Nunavut
and
the
Northwest
Territories)
Two
suggested
plans
of
attack
are
either
to
start
in
Toronto
or
MontrÃ©al
and
take
in
Ontario
and
QuÃ©bec
with
side
trips
to
the
Atlantic
coast
or
even
out
to
the
West;
or
to
start
in
Vancouver
or
Calgary
and
explore
the
Rockies
and
British
Columbia
before
heading
east
to
Ontario
or
QuÃ©bec
taking
in
the
Prairies
on
cross-country
train
ride
The
North
on
first
trip
must
be
considered
proposition
strictly
for
the
adventurous
In
any
case
count
on
at
least
three
weeks
ideally
month
to
even
begin
to
do
the
place
justice
When
One
of
the
great
advantages
to
Canadaâs
vast
size
is
that
apart
from
couple
of
major
tourist
attractions
such
as
Niagara
Falls
itâs
never
overcrowded
Even
in
high
summer
thereâs
still
plenty
of
room
for
everybody
Nonetheless
it
is
advisable
to
make
advance
bookings
for
some
resort
hotels
on
the
Pacific
coast
in
the
Rockies
or
around
the
Great
Lakes
July
and
August
guarantee
the
best
weather
though
it
can
get
very
hot
in
MontrÃ©al
Toronto
and
the
Prairie
Provinces
(aggravated
in
those
provinces
by
the
hot
chinook
wind
off
the
Rockies)
Farther
to
the
north
mosquitoes
can
be
problem
in
summer
Connoisseurs
of
the
forests
of
QuÃ©bec
and
the
Maritimes
favor
the
spectacular
autumn
from
September
to
mid-October
While
the
West
Coast
is
mild
in
May
and
June
in
central
and
eastern
Canada
youâll
still
find
snow
on
the
ground
in
May
and
nip
in
the
air
into
the
month
of
June
The
period
from
November
to
April
is
strictly
for
winter
sports
enthusiasts
Remember
the
old
adage:
Thereâs
no
bad
weather
only
bad
clothing
In
addition
to
your
light
summer
wear
be
sure
to
bring
sweater
for
the
occasional
chilly
evenings
Rather
than
weighing
down
your
luggage
with
anything
cumbersome
take
leaf
out
of
the
Canadiansâ
book
and
keep
warm
by
wearing
several
layers
If
youâre
thinking
of
going
north
consider
long
underwear
In
any
case
donât
forget
raincoat
especially
for
British
Columbia
Important
everywhere
is
good
pair
of
walking
shoesÂ âÂ something
light
but
more
solid
than
tennis
shoes
How
The
most
adventurous
traveler
who
loves
to
improvise
will
still
need
certain
amount
of
advance
planning
Canadaâs
provincial
tourist
offices
are
conscientious
and
well
worth
consulting
even
before
you
leave
home
The
national
tourist
office
is
also
helpful
but
in
Canada
the
provinces
jealously
protect
their
prerogatives
against
the
federal
government
and
maintain
their
own
tourist
offices
that
can
give
you
detailed
information
about
resorts
accommodations
camping
and
sports
facilities
To

Railtours
(tel

which
offers
daylight
trips
through

Buses
are

for
the
occasional
excursion

essential
for

will
arrange
for

The
Trans-Canada
Highway
stretches
nearly
8,000
km
(4,800
miles)
from
coast
to
coast
and
secondary
roads
are
very
good
until
you
get
into
the
backwoods
Inside
the
major
cities
you
may
prefer
to
park
your
car
and
use
the
generally
efficient
public
transport
One
of
the
best
ways
to
explore
the
hinterland
especially
in
the
national
and
provincial
parks
is
to
rent
comfortably
equipped
mobile

This
too

be
done
in

ONTARIO
This
choice
piece
of
real
estate
between
the
Great
Lakes
and
Hudson
Bay
is
the
countryâs
dominant
provinceÂ âÂ too
dominant
for
the
liking
of
many
of
the
others
With
10
million
people
clustered
almost
entirely
along
the
southern
border
Ontario
is
the
most
populous
province
and
the
wealthiest
generating
close
to
40
percent
of
the
gross
national
product
from
manufacturing
construction
minerals
forestry
and
agriculture
The
province
has
grown
in
vitality
with
the
influx
of
Italian
German
Portuguese
Caribbean
Indian
and
Pakistani
immigrants
reducing
the
once
overwhelming
âBritishâ
majority
to
barely
50
percent
If
Ontarians
are
known
for
their
bumptious
spirit
they
certainly
have
something
to
be
bumptious
about
in
their
provinceâs
burgeoning
towns
and
the
riches
of
its
farmlands
forests
and
lakes
Not
content
with
taking
over
from
MontrÃ©al
as
the
nationâs
business

Toronto
is
surging

with
vigorous
cultural
and
social
life
Bemused
visitors
from
across

border
note
how
it
has
been
possible
to
create
vibrant
modern
metropolis
without
the
hassles
of
inner-city
blight
and
violence
As
the
national
capital
Ottawa
is
the
inevitable
butt
of
jokes
against
its
federal
government
bureaucracy
but
patriots
revere
its
parliament

starts
down

you
may
prefer
to
start
downtown
around

and
visit
the
other
sights
to
the

before
coming
back
to
relax
among
the

The
latter
is
the
most
popular
with
Torontonians
and
its
beaches
are

landmark
is
the

Hockey

provides
tonic
lesson
for
American

to
recall
among
the

sticks
the
fact
that
nearly
all
their

heroes
are
Canadian-born
With
the
many
splits
between
Anglo-

the
closest

locations
sandwiched
between
the
Gardner
Expressway
and
the
railway
tracks
When
Lieutenant
Governor
Simcoe
built
it
in
1793
it
commanded
strategic
position
directly
on
the
lakeshore
facing
potential
attack
from
across
the
American
border
In
the
War
of
1812
retreating
British
forces
chose
to
destroy
it
rather
than
let
it
fall
into
American
hands
It
was
rebuilt
in
1841
and
restored
in
1934
as
tourist
attraction
with
diorama
of
the
Battle
of
York
and

Heart
of
Downtown
The
essence
of
Toronto
old
and
new
is
concentrated
around
Union
Station
It
was
inaugurated
by
the
Prince
of
Wales
in
1927
when
stations
were
still
built
like
Greek
temples
(Corinthian
pillars
heroic
statues
and
ceramic-tiled
ceilings);
it
is
one
last
proud
fanfare
for
the
transcontinental
railways
that
founded
the
countryâs
industrial
prosperity
In
this
headquarters
city
of
Canadian
National
railways
the
station
also
symbolized
Torontoâs
position
as
major
commercial
and
industrial
center
Across
the
street
the
venerable
Royal
York
hotel
refurbished
to
something
of
its
1929
grandeur
provides
businessmenâs
palace
as
appropriate
counterpart
It
is
linked
to
the
station
by
large
underground
concourse
of
shops
and
banks

Californiaâs
Hearst
Castle
Its

are
all
self-respecting
financier
like
Henry
Pellatt
could
have
wished
for
After
touring
the
castles
of
Europe
for
few
ideas
he
built
the
98-room
mansion
in
the
early
1900s
at
the
then-astronomical
cost
of
$3,500,000
He
chose
his
oak
and
walnut
from
North
America
teak
from
Asia
paneling
marble
and
glass
from
Europe
With
all
its
terraces
massive
walls
and
echoing
rooms
it
isnât
exactly
cozy
That
may
explain
why
Pellatt
provided
himself
with
secret
escape
route
through
hidden
staircase
leading
from
his
study
(and
now
open
to
the
public)
Whatever
folly
of
grandeur
the

entertained

seen

The

how
nature

to
triumph
over
tawdry
commercialism

less
strident
on

Itâs
worth
beginning
your
visit
with
the
half-hour
documentary
film
to
understand
the
dramatic
fate
of
the
mission
It
must
be
said
that
the
Huron
were
less
interested
in
conversion
to
Christianity
than
in
the
goods
to
be
gained
from
the
fur
traders
who
followed
the
priests
on
this
first
French
settlement
in
Ontario
But
dealing
directly
with
Europeans
threatened
the
position
of
the
rival
Iroquois
as
middlemen
between
the
Huron
(and
Algonquin)
and
the
Dutch
and
British
traders
down
in
Albany
New
York
The
Iroquois
killed
thousands
of
Huron
in
all-out
war
and
two
Jesuits
Jean
de
BrÃ©beuf
and
Gabriel
Lalemant
were
tortured
to
death
To
halt
the
Iroquois
advance
the
French
community
of
300
burned
their
own

Thunder
Bay
For
vacationers
this
town
strategically
located
on
Lake
Superiorâs
northwest
shore
is
springboard
to
the
national
parks
of
Ontarioâs
interior
But
itâs
also
worth
taking
look
first
at
the
impressive
port
facilities
of
this
western
terminus
of
the
St
LawrenceâGreat
Lakes
Seaway
which
has
given
Thunder
Bay
its
second
name:
the
Lakehead
Freighters
come
3,200
km
(1,920
miles)
inland
from
the
Atlantic
to
take
on
grain

from
the
Prairie
Provinces
or
bring
other
heavy

to
all
points
west
in
both
Canada
and
the
United

Starting
out
from
the

cruise
takes
you
around
the

view
of

Sheep

the
courtyard
lawns
bread
is
still
made
in
the
bakery
and
the
cookhouse
provides
lusty
country
fare
In
the
company
store
youâll
see
the
kind
of
simple
copper
and
pewter
utensils
and
steel
knives
that
were
more
precious
than
gold
to
the
MidÃ©wiwin
Indians
bringing
in
their
beaver
pelts
Just
up
the
road
40
km
(25
miles)
northwest
of
Thunder
Bay
the
beautiful
Kakabeka
Falls
is
surrounded
by
its
own
provincial
park
providing
quiet
natural
setting
thatâs
far
cry
from
Niagara

takes
you
through
the

along

(154-ft)
cascade
flows
at
its

in

There
are

Canoeists
and

intent
on
getting
away
from
civilization
head
two
hours
west
of
Thunder
Bay
along
Highway
11
to
the
Quetico
Provincial
Park
This
is
the
country
through
which
the
NorâWestersâ
coureurs
de
bois
paddled
their
way
to
the
Indian
trappersâ
remote
camps
adopting
the
nativesâ
lore
for
tackling
the
wilderness
including
their
snowshoes
toboggans
and
birchbark
canoes
The
indigenous
peoples
have
been
here
for
9,000
years
and
have
left
their
colored
pictographs
of
moose
caribou
bears
and
turtles
etched
in
the
granite
cliffs
The
only
road
into
the
park
leads
to
the
Dawson
Trail
Campgrounds
on
French
LakeÂ âÂ pleasant
for
dayâs
picnic
and
swimming
For
longer
stays
the
information
office
provides
detailed
maps
of
Queticoâs
fantastic
network
of
interlocking

You
can
rent
canoeÂ âÂ no
motor

in
the

mining
and
logging
town
of
Atikokan
Ottawa
Like
most
national
capitals
created
artificially
to
avoid
favoring
one
established
metropolis
over
another
Ottawa
is
the
perennial
butt
of
carping
and
jokes
Itâs
true
of
Washington
of
BrasÃ­lia
of
Canberra
and
even
more
so
in
Canada
where
the
very
idea
of
centralized
federal
government
is
so
hotly
contested
by
its
independent-minded
provinces
People
rarely
like
government
at
the
best
of
times
and
when
itâs
the
townâs
main
almost
exclusive
âindustry,â
they
have
built-in
prejudice
against
it
But
Ottawaâs
second
major
source
of
income
is
nonetheless
tourism
because
the
town
is
pleasant
offering
pretty
setting
of
parks
and
waterways
for
its
first-class
museums
and
colorful
monuments
The
countryâs
short
history
is
epitomized
by
skyline
of
solid
Victorian
parliamentary
buildings
and
bold
modern
architecture
of
office
blocks
and
the
new
National
Gallery
And
the
government
machinery
remains
firmly
in
touch
with
its
roots
when
in
winter
the
bureaucrats
skate
and
ski
to
work
along
the
frozen
Rideau
Canal
Accommodatingly
situated
on
the
border
between
Ontario
and
QuÃ©bec
Ottawa
is
fully
bilingual
city
though
most
of
the
French-speaking
community
(and
the
best
restaurants)
now
have
their
homes
in
Hull
on
the
QuÃ©bec
side
of
the
Ottawa
River
Except
for
longer
excursions
try
to
leave
the
car
in
the
hotel
parking
lot
and
walk
or
take
the
bus
The
complex
system
of
one-way
streets
designed
to
avoid
rather
than
to
reach
key
government
buildings
and
the
added
confusion
of
curving
rivers
and
canals
make
downtown
driving
harrowing
business
even
for
locals
One
other
point:
In
the
absence
of
any
clear
logic
in
street
numbering
itâs
important
when
noting
an
address
to
be
sure
you
have
the
nearest
cross-streets
as
well
as
the
number
of
the
building
Parliament
Area
Like
the
Parliament
assemblage
in
London
from
which
they
unashamedly
take
their
architectural
inspiration
the
Parliament
Buildings
are
an
imposing
Neo-Gothic
pile
restored
from
the
ruins
left
after
devastating
fire
in
1916
(a
current
restoration
is
slated
for
completion
in
the

2000)
They
dominate
the
Ottawa
River
from

exaggeratedly
known
as
Parliament
Hill
As
counterpart
to
Westminsterâs
Big
Ben
the
98-m
(294-ft)
Peace
Tower
with

on

The

On
the
vast
three-sided
Confederation
SquareÂ âÂ popularly
known
for
its
traffic
congestion
as
âConfusion
SquareâÂ âÂ notice
the
great
granite
arch
of
the
National
War
Memorial
with
its
statues
of
22
World
War
soldiers
and
horse-drawn
cannon
Ironically
it
was
dedicated
by
George
VI
just
three
months
before
the
outbreak
of
World
War
II
The
squareâs
bunker-like
National
Arts
Centre
(1969)
houses
the
capitalâs
ballet
opera
and
theater
but
itâs
the
summer
beer-garden
overlooking
the
Rideau
Canal
that
is
the
most
popular
attraction
Getting
federal
governmentâs
priorities
in
proper
perspective
one
member
of
parliament
bemoaned
the
cultural
center
as
â50
years
ahead
of
its
timeÂ âÂ thatâs
how
long
itâll
take
the
taxpayers
to
meet
the
500

overrun.â
The
formidable
ChÃ¢teau
Laurier
(1912)
railway

on
the
north

of

Local
citizens
boast
that
the
Rideau
Canal
which
stretches
200
km
(120
miles)
from
the
Ottawa
River
to
Lake
Ontario
qualifies
in
winter
as
âthe
worldâs
longest
skating
rink.â
In
summer
it
offers
delightful
boat
cruises
and
canoeing
or
you
can
explore
its
banks
with
rented
bicycle
On
the
edge
of
the
parliamentary
district
across
the
Rideau
Canal
is
Byward
Market
(one

east
of
Sussex
Drive
and
north
of
Rideau

Since

it
was
clearing
house
for
nearby
farmers
this
has
been
the

for

In
its
jolly
well-restored
state
only
one
of
the
market
stalls
dates
as
far
back
as
1867
but
the
market
retains
much
of
its
19th-century
atmosphere
Quite
apart
from
the
colorful
stalls
of
fruit
and
vegetables
itâs

place
for

from

IfÂ âÂ oh
happy
dreamÂ âÂ all
the
old
ethnic
rivalries
could
be
set
aside
most
Canadians
would
acknowledge
that
QuÃ©bec
is
not
only
the
âoriginalâ
Canada
of
the
first
European
settlement
but
also
the
province
that
most
comprehensively
encompasses
within
its
borders
the
worldâs
image
of
this
huge
country
To
begin
with
it
is
itself
huge:
It
could
contain
according
to
your
taste
three
Frances
or
seven
Britains
Most
of
itÂ âÂ two-thirds
of
the
areaÂ âÂ is
forest
The
north
is
coniferous
serving
the
provinceâs
important
pulp
and
paper
industry
and
the
south
is
deciduous
with
the
maple
of
the
national
flag
providing
delicious
syrup
and
the
ash
oak
and
beech
that
blaze
into
crimson
amber
and
gold
in
autumn
There
arenât
as
many
beavers
as
in
the
great
days
of
the
fur
trade
but
still
enough
to
fell
few
trees
around
the
resort
cottages
in
the
Laurentian
Mountains
north
of
MontrÃ©al
Deer
and
moose
abound
for
the

farther
north
there
are

and
up

few
polar
bears
too

QuÃ©bec
City
and
the
resolutely
French-speaking
farm
villages
along
the
St

and
around
the
GaspÃ©
Peninsula
have
thought
for
local
patriotic
sensibility
The
QuÃ©bÃ©cois
can
justly
claim
to
be
cofounders
of
the
Canadian
nation
Abandoned
by
what
many
still
call
the
âdamned
Frenchâ
(maudits
franÃ§ais)
they
felt
that
they
alone
had
earned
the
name
of
canadiens
and
that
their
British
conquerors
usurped
it
As
tribute
to
their
own
past
courage
there
is
both
pride
and
resentment
in
the
QuÃ©bÃ©cois
motto
âJe
me
souviensâ
(âI
Rememberâ)
It
was
they
who
made
the
first
and
hardiest
effort
to
hew
modern
living
out
of
this
hard
land
Like
colonials
everywhere
their
missionaries
sometimes
brought
more
religion
their
traders
more
alcohol
and
their
soldiers
more
guns
than
the
natives
really
needed
But
the
QuÃ©bÃ©cois
understood
the
importance
of
learning
from
the
native
peoples
how
best
to
handle
the
Canadian
wilderness
Fur-trading
coureurs
de
bois
settled
down
with
Indian
wives
and
today
more
than
few
QuÃ©bÃ©cois
proudly
trace
their
ancestry
back
to
native
peoples
with
tell-tale
birthmark
on
the
hip
high
cheekbones
or
long
sleek
black
hair
Outside

you
canât

at

paid
them
the
courtesy
of
âBonjour.â

Across

the
19th-century
HÃ´tel
de

(City

is
built
in
the

of
the
French
Renaissance
It
was
from
the
balcony

in
1967
that
General
de

delivered
his
incendiary
cry
of
âVive
le
QuÃ©bec

warming
the
hearts
of
local

The
general
was
not
intimidated
by
the
statue
of
Lord
Horatio
Nelson
watching
him
from
the
top
of
Place
Jacques-Cartier
MontrÃ©alâs
oldest
monument
was
somewhat
provocatively
erected
in
1809
just
four
years
after
the
British
admiralâs
devastating
defeat
of
the
French
at
Trafalgar
Diagonally
opposite
the
HÃ´tel
de
Ville
on
rue
Notre-Dame
the
ChÃ¢teau
Ramezay
was
home
of
the
French
governor
Claude
de
Ramezay
from
1705
to
1724
It
passed
successively
into
the
hands
of
the
French
West
Indies
Trading
Company
(to
store
its
spices)
the
British
and
during
their
brief
occupation
of
the
city
in
1775
the
American
generals
Richard
Montgomery
and
Benedict
Arnold
Benjamin
Franklin
stayed
here
during
his
fruitless
attempt
to
win
QuÃ©bec
over
to
the
American
cause
After
years
of
neglect
the
chÃ¢teau
has
been
restored
and
transformed
into
museum
showing
more
comfortable
side
of
frontier
life
in
New
France:
elegant
18th-century
furnishings
grand
colonial
kitchen
in
the

and

nice
added

of
magnificent
carved
mahogany

The
Maison
Papineau
(Number
440)
distinguished
by
its
double
row
of
gabled
garrets
in
the
roof
dates
back
to
1785
It
is
the
family
home
of
the
controversial
19th-century
politician
Louis-Joseph
Papineau
leader
of
the
militant
patriotes
but
also
cautious
protector
of
his
seigneurial
property
(see
page
19)
In
1837
the
house
nearly
burned
down
in
violent
riot
and
British
soldiers
had
to
come
to
Papineauâs
rescue
He
fled
to
the
countryside
and
did
not
take
part
in
the
subsequent
insurrection
On
the
corner
of
rue
St-Paul
the
older
Maison
du
Calvet
was
built
in
1725
by
prominent
Huguenot
merchant
As
Protestant
Pierre
du
Calvet
was
appointed
by
the
British
justice
of
the
peace
but
then
ended
up
in
jail
himself
for
selling
supplies
and
information
to
the
American
invaders
With
its
broad
chimney
fine-grained
limestone

framed
copy
of
the
bilingual
QuÃ©bec

dating

suggests
that
colonials
of

had
an

interest
in
the
more
arcane

of

and
three
young
woman
companions
brought
civilizing
influence
to
the
harshness
of
the
beleaguered
settlement
Acting
as
both
teachers
and
nurses
they
also
took
charge
of
marriageable
girls
known
as
the
filles
du
Roi
the
âKingâs
daughters.â
The
filles
du
Roi
were
in
fact
daughters
of
peasants
and
poor
artisans
shipped
over
from
France
as
wives
for
bachelor
farmers
and
fur
traders
In
the
19th
century
Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours
became
the
âSailorsâ
Chapel,â
to
which
survivors
of
shipwrecks
brought
model
ships
they
had
carved
as
offerings
of
thanksgiving
The
models
still
hang
from
the
ceiling
lit
up
now
by
tiny
electric

Notice
how
the
trompe

painting
on
the
low

aspires
to
turn

Most
of
the
ugly
old
warehouses
have
been
demolished
along
the
Vieux
Port
at
the
foot
of
Place
Jacques-Cartier
Some
have
been
refurbished
as

An

on
the

The

at

Pointe
is
of
an
Anglo-Canadian
John
Young
who
developed
the
portâs
commerce
in
the
19th

The
rue
St-Sulpice
takes
you
over
the
Place
dâArmes
close
to
the
site
of
the
first
French
battles
with
the
Iroquois
Today
it
serves
as
visual
link
between
the
historic
old
town
of
the
pioneers
and
the
new
city
of
commerce
and
industry
In

looking
very
like

of
Alexandre
Dumasâ

The
19th-century
Neo-Gothic
Notre-Dame
Basilica
was
designed
by
James
OâDonell
an
Irish
Protestant
New
Yorker
so
inspired
by
his
assignment
that
he
converted
to
Catholicism
It
once
took
12
men
to
ring
the
great
bell
in
the
west

now
accomplished
with

St-Sulpice
MontrÃ©alâs
oldest
surviving
edifice
built
in
1685
to

It
also

is
enclosed
on

including
the

the

to
your

of

The
Youville
Stables
(Ecuries
dâYouville)
are
an
enchanting
collection
of
early
19th-century
grey-stone
gabled
buildings
now
containing
restaurants
and
offices
looking
out
onto
peaceful
garden
The
U-shaped
courtyard
makes
lovely
setting
for
open-air
plays
and
recitals
in
the
summer
The
âstablesâ
were
in
fact
nothing
more
romantic
than
warehouse
but
they
did
for
time
serve
as
garage
for
horse-carriages
Next
to
the
stables
is
an
old
red-brick
fire
station
transformed
into
the
MontrÃ©al
History
Center
(Centre

presenting

Downtown
The
nucleus
of
downtown
MontrÃ©al
is
located
between
Boulevard
RenÃ©
LÃ©vesque
and
Sherbrooke
Street
running
parallel
to
the
river
bounded
by
Guy
and
St-Denis
Streets
It
is
best
characterized
by
its
bold
new
office
skyscrapers
cultural
complexes
and
shopping
centers
crowding
in
on
die-hard
bunch
of
old
churches
museums
and
all-night
delicatessens
Start

Northeast
along
Boulevard
RenÃ©
LÃ©vesque
is
the
Roman-Catholic
cathedral
of
MontrÃ©al
something
of
visual
oddity
at
least
for
European
visitors
The
cathedral
of
Marie-Reine-du-Monde
(Mary
Queen
of
the
World)
is
19th-century
half-size
replica
of
St
Peterâs
Basilica
in
Rome
Half-size
but
still
massive
enoughÂ âÂ inside
the
nave
is
109
(328
ft)
long
the
transept
is
73
(220
ft)
long
and
the
vault
of
the
dome
is
83
(250
ft)
high
Beneath
that
dome
over
the
high
altar
is
another
replica
of
St
Peterâs:
Berniniâs
celebrated
gilded
bronze
canopy
Unfortunately
there
is
nothing
to
match
Berniniâs
great
square
to
give
you
proper
perspective
and
the
church
is
dwarfed
by
the
huge
Queen
Elizabeth
Hotel
and
the
Sun
Life
skyscraper
The
new
gigantism
continues
with
Place
Ville-Marie
(1962)
dominated
by
the
other
side
of
the
Queen
Elizabeth
Canadian
National
Railwayâs
Central

But
Place

is
above

the

These

With

Vieux

is
tourist
attraction
for
the
landmarks
of
the
cityâs
historical
beginnings
while
downtown
is
for
business
and

nights
out
But
the
real
color
and
spice
of
the
peopleâs
everyday
life
is
to
be
found
in
their
neighborhoods
And
youâll
find
in
the
architecture
the
missing
links
between
the
French-inspired
homes
of
Vieux
MontrÃ©al
and
the
international
anonymity
of

(MÃ©tro
Pie-IX)
the
impressive
complex
of
sports
facilities
built
specifically
for
the
1976
Olympic
Games
is
an
eloquent
monument
to
the
visions
of
grandeur
that
characterized
Mayor
Jean
Drapeau
After
the
sweeping
(some
would
say
devastating)
downtown
redevelopment
and
the
ambitious
construction
on
the
St
Lawrence
River
for
Expo
â67
the
Olympic
Park
was
to
be
the
apotheosis
of
his
ânew
MontrÃ©al.â
As
you
can
see
on
one
of
the
daily
guided
tours
through
Olympic
Park
the
result
is
as
grandiose
in
design
as
it
has
been
ruinous
in
cost
to
the
continuing
chagrin
of
local
taxpayers
with
long
memories
and
short
bank
balances
Centerpiece
is
the
mammoth
Olympic
Stadium
seating
70,000
spectators
for
the
home
games
of
the
MontrÃ©al
Expos
baseball
team
and
rockânâroll
concerts
One
of
the
most
popular
facilities
is
the
VÃ©lodrome
with
redwood
track
for
cycling
and
roller-skating
around
central
arena
for
boxing
wrestling
and
basketball
with
ice-skating
in

After
years
of

the
river
behind
bleak
expanse
of

MontrÃ©al
has
opened
up
its
waterfront
more
recently
with
the

market
of
the
Vieux

but
largely
at
the
earlier
instigation
of
that
much
maligned
Mayor

Expo
â67
provided
the
major
breakthrough
with
the
choice
of
the
riverâs
Ile

as
the
principal
site
for
the

Museums
Among
the
most
important
of
MontrÃ©alâs
many
museums
is
its
Museum
of
Fine
Arts
(MusÃ©e
des
Beaux
Arts)
1380
Sherbrooke
Street
West
It
has
an
honorable
collection
of
European
artists
including
El
Greco
Rubens
Hans
Memling
Cranach
and
Poussin
and
the
British
18th-century
masters
Reynolds
Gainsborough
Raeburn
Romney
and
Hogarth
The
moderns
include
Picasso
and
Giacometti
But
itâs
worth
devoting
most
of
your
time
here
to
the
excellent
Canadian
galleries
In
the
19th-century
section
look
for
the
imposing
if
rather
severe
classical
portraits
of
Antoine-SÃ©bastien
Plamondon
(1802â1895)
and
the
markedly
gentler
works
of
his
QuÃ©bÃ©cois
student
and
rival
ThÃ©ophile
Hamel
(1817â1870)
Mah-Min
or
The
Feather
is
dramatic
study
of
an
Assiniboine
Indian
chief
in
Manitoba
by
Paul
Kane
(1810â1871)
This
Torontonian
born
in
County
Cork

traveled
all
over

visual
record

times

romanticized
of
Canadaâs
native
peoples
His
contemporary
Amsterdam-born
Cornelius
Krieghoff
(1815â1872)
concentrated
on
the
QuÃ©bec
peasantry

see
here

striking
Montmorency
Falls

The
dazzling

James
Wilson
Morrice
(1865â1924)

work
by
this
most
celebrated
of
Canadaâs
expatriate
painters

of
Matisse
he
worked
principally
in
Europe
and
North
Africa
Tom
Thomson
the
Group
of
Seven
and
Emily
Carr
all
have
major
works
here
But
of
the
moderns
the
most
significant
represented
is
Paul-Emile
Borduas
(1905â1960)
His
Les
signes
sâenvolent
and
LâÃ©toile
noire
are
stark
disturbing
abstracts
by
man
who
began
his
career
as
painter
of
church
murals
and
stained
glass
Rebelling
against
conservative
religion

the
dual
influences

QuÃ©bec
City
Whereas
MontrÃ©al
has
become
increasingly
âAmericanized,â
the
provincial
capital
remains
unmistakably
even
defiantly
QuÃ©bÃ©cois
if
not
downright
âFrench.â
Itâs
difficult
to
miss
in
this
proud
cradle
of
New
France
that
the
town
is
borrowing
leaf
from
the
book
of
the
modern
French
republic
by
calling
its
provincial
parliament
the
AssemblÃ©e
Nationale
Only
one
percent
of
the
population
of
664,000
do
not
speak
French
The
historic
center
of
the
city
has
something
of
the
atmosphere
of
Franceâs
Atlantic
port
towns
in
the
neighborhood
down
by
the
St
Lawrence
River
while
the
streets
and
squares
up
on
the
promontory
offer
North
Americans
first
hint
of
Parisâs
Latin
Quarter
or
even
Montmartre
Certainly
itâs
town
for
that
most
Parisian
of
creatures
the
flÃ¢neur
or
stroller
wandering
at
leisure
through
narrow
back
streets
paying
due
homage
to
the
monuments
of
QuÃ©bec
Cityâs
past
triumphs
and
tribulations
but
even
more
alert
to
the
colors
and
smells
of
the
living
present
QuÃ©bec
is
said
to
be
derived
from
an
Algonquin
word
meaning
âwhere
the
river
narrows,â
and
this
becomes
most
apparent
when
you
see
the
cityâs
great
outcrop
of
rock
jutting
out
over
the
St
Lawrence
It
was
named
Cap
Diamant
after
the
shiny
stones
that
Jacques
Cartier
mistook
for
diamonds
(see
page
14)
Thus
the
city
dominated
river
traffic
and
prospered
from
flourishing
trade
in
fur
lumber
shipbuilding
tanneries
furniture
and
textiles
Modern
shipping
and
the
advent
of
the
railways
crippled
its
port
activities
and
the
city
now
lives
from
the
service
industries
of
tourism
and
provincial
government
administration
For
the
best
view
of
the
cityâs
spectacular
location
cross
over
to
the
St
Lawrence
Riverâs
south
bank
and
take
the
ferry
(traversier)
from
the
suburb
of
LÃ©vis
Otherwise
head
through
the
airy
but
unexceptional
modern
city

Start
on

where
the
cityâs
principal
landmark
is
hotel
the
ChÃ¢teau
Frontenac
looming
over
the
town
since
1892
like
the
protective
fortress
it
no
longer
needs
Because
of
its
dramatic
location
and
the
fairytale
turrets
of
its
Gothic-Renaissance
architecture
the
Frontenac
is
one
of
the
most
charmingly
bombastic
of
all
the
many
grand
hotels
that
the
Canadian
Pacific
and
Canadian
National
railways
put
up
across
the
country
as
symbols
of
their
commercial
power
It
is
named
after
Count
Louis
de
Frontenac
rascally
17th-century
French
governor
who
upset
the
clergy
by
encouraging
the
sale
of
brandy
to
the
native
peoples
Take
look

The

After
centuries
of
devastation
by
war
fire
plunder

sheer
neglect
the
meticulous
restoration
work
by

been
major
act
of

After
1759
most
colonial
administrators
and
merchants
just
abandoned
QuÃ©bec
while
many
who
stayed
on
moved
to
the
shelter
of
the
new
British
defenses
in
the
Upper
Town
During
the
19th
and
early
20th
centuries
older
buildings
were
often
arbitrarily
razed
to
make
way
for
waterfront
warehouses
and
workshops
Among

more

known
as
the
Maritimes
Last
to
join
the
Canadian
Confederation
in
1949
the
offshore
island
of
Newfoundland
is
linked
as
one
province
with
the
mainland
region
of
Labrador
The
Maritimes
and
Newfoundland
together
now
known
as
the
Atlantic
Provinces
have
often
felt
neglected
They
were
the
last
provinces
to
benefit
from
transcontinental
railways
and
highways
New
Brunswickâs
shipbuilding
timber
suffered
in
the
age
of
steam
and
steel
hulls
Newfoundlandâs
fisheries
were
equally
hard
hit
when
modern
refrigeration
made
it
possible
for
foreign
companies
to
dispense
with
the
islandâs
centuries-old
drying
techniques
Economic
hardship
prompted
some
to
migrate
to
other
regions
But
this
separateness
has
shaped
hardy
people
of
considerable
character
and
charm
Just
getting
to
know
them
makes
the
journey
worthwhile
Youâll
find
them
cheerful
friendly
and
more
easily
approachable
than
the
big-city

of
Ontario
and
QuÃ©bec
Newfoundland
is
peopled
almost
exclusively
from
the
southwest
of
England
and
southern
Ireland
whence
the
special
music
and
color
of
their
dialect
(see

The
Maritimes
have
been
mainly
settled
by
Scottish
Highlanders
German
Protestants
and
French-speaking
Acadians
The
cooler

strictly
summer
and

autumn
destination
Itâs
land
of
hiking
camping
and
fishing
with
some
good
swimming
off
Prince
Edward
Island
and
Nova
Scotia
If
the
Maritimes
are
warm
to
mellow
from
late
June
to
early
September
Newfoundland
is
little
fresher
Nova
Scotia
Youâd
think
the
chamber
of
commerce
carved
their
map
as
public
relations
gimmick
but
the
province
really
is
shaped
like
lobster
In
any
case
many
gourmet
or
glutton
feels
that
Halifax
lobster
dinner
is
reason
enough
to
make
the

Thereâs
the
sparkling
Atlantic

Without

from
the

on

Newfoundland
can
lay
just
claim
to
being
the
true
beginning
of
Europeâs
adventure
in
North
America
Anyone
seeking
to
understand
Canadaâs
role
in
shaping
North
America
should
spare
few
days
for
this
bracing
province
of
hardy
fisherfolkÂ âÂ first
Canadian
land
to
be
âfoundâ
and
last
to
join
the
Confederation
(incorporating
Labrador)
in
1949
The
land
and
seascapes
are
impressively
rugged
and
the
spirited
people
sheer
delight
Life
in
isolated
fishing
communities
has
given
the
Newfies
keen
sense
of
local
identity
Citizens
of
the
capital
of
St
Johnâs
are
âtownees,â
those
on
the
outskirts
âbay-men,â
and
the
towns
beyond
are
known
as
âoutports.â
âCanadianâ
is
still
reserved
for
mainlander
âSeek
ye
first
the
Kingdom
of
God,â
says
the
provincial
motto
âBut
on
your
way
look
out
for
Newfoundland,â
seems
to
have
been
the
slogan
of
the
old
North
Atlantic
navigators
from
the
good
Irish
Abbot
Brendan
in
the
sixth
century
and
the
wild
Norsemen
in
the
11th
to
all
the
Basque
French
Spanish
and
Portuguese
fishermen
who
preceded
explorer
John
Cabot
paid
Â£10
by
Henry
VII
for
finding
âthe
new
isleâ
in
1497
It
was
the
fishermen
who
really
knew
what
the
island
was
worthÂ âÂ the
Grand
Banks
to
the
east
of
Newfoundland
are
the
richest
breeding
ground
of
cod
in
the
world
For
centuries
the
island
existed
only
for
its
offshore
fish
Any
permanent
settlement
was
actively
discouraged
so
as
not
to
compete
with
Britainâs
West
Country
merchants
Even
after
the
first
serious
colonization
of
the
18th
century
the
forests
of
the
interior
were
exploited
just
for
building
fishermenâs
cottages
and
their
ships
No
towns
were
built
away
from
the
coast
St
Johnâs
Local
folklore
insists
that
the
name
(not
to
be
confused
with
Saint
John
New
Brunswick)
comes
from
the
saintâs
day
of
John
the
Baptist
June
24
when
John
Cabot
arrived
here
in
1497
Newfoundlandâs
capital
and
largest
city
retains
the
simple
allure
of
the
fishing
port
it
has
always
been
and
the
picturesque
harbor
is
the
place
to
begin
In
the
19th
century
the
town
burned
down
five
times
but
it
still
stubbornly
builds
wooden
houses
overlooking
the
waterfront
Their
brightly
painted
walls
add
welcome
touch
of
color
to
the
gaunt
grey
trawlers
in
the
docksÂ âÂ from
Britain
of
course
but
also
Russia
and
even
Japan
Parallel
to
the
harbor
youâll
find
on
Gower
Street
the
prettiest
Victorian
houses
painted
burgundy
lemon
burnt
sienna
dove
grey
and
white
Newfoundland
Museum
on
Duckworth
Street
recounts
the
human
history
of
the
island
displaying
the
dwellings
and
artifacts
of
the
Inuit
and
native
peoples
including
the
now-extinct
Beothuk
and
the
costume
furniture
and
implements
of
the
first
European
fishermen
Another
section
of
the
museum
in
the
shopping
center
of
the
Murray
Premises
down
on
Harbour
Drive
is
devoted
to
the
provinceâs
colorful
seafaring
history
Safely
up
on
hill
on
Military
Road
the
Catholic
Basilica
of
St
John
the
Baptist
(1850)
escaped
the
numerous
fires
to
dominate
the
townâs
skyline
with
its
granite
and
limestone
towers
Down
on
Gower
Street
the
Anglican
Cathedral
also
named
after
John
the
Baptist
burned
down
twice
and
its
simple
Neo-Gothic
20th-century
version
is
still
without
steeple
For
the
best
view
of
the
harbor
go
up
to
Signal
Hill
looking
over
the
narrows
and
out
to
the
Atlantic
Ocean
The
hill
was
fortified
to
guard
the
harbor
entrance
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
and
you
can
still
see
cannon
of
the
Queenâs
Battery
installed
in
1796
The
Cabot
Tower
atop
the
hill
was
built
in

1901
in

improvised
near
the

in

(burned
down
in
1920)
Guglielmo
Marconi
suddenly
yelled:
âDo
you
hear
that?
Do
you
hear
that?â
What
the
Italian
inventor
was
so
excited
about
were
three
faint
dots
of
the
letter
in
Morse
from
his
transmitter
in
Poldhu
Cornwall
The
group
of
dour
Newfie
fishermen
listening
in
were
more
impressed
by
this
fellow
jumping
up
and
down
than
by
historyâs
first
transatlantic

is
commemorated

BRITISH
COLUMBIA
âSuch
land,â
said
Rudyard
Kipling
in
1908
âis
good
for
an
energetic
man
It
is
also
not
bad
for
loafer.â
Thatâs
still
true
today
British
Columbia
the
third
largest
province
is
supremely
the
land
of
the
wild
outdoors
with
the
constant
challenge
of
rugged
mountains
seemingly
impenetrable
forests
jagged
coastline
and
dizzily
fast-moving
rivers
But
its
capital
is
the
smiling
sleepy
town
of
Victoria
evoking
genteel
British
past
that
the
British
themselves
may
well
have
forgotten
And
the
provinceâs
principal
city
with
population
of
1.7
million
is
the
beautifully
situated
Vancouver
home
of
easy
living
elegant

all
the

of

Long
after
Northwest
Coast
Indians
had
found
the
region
to
be
hospitable
land
of
plenty
it
was
explored
and
âworkedâ
by
Scottish
fur
traders
who
called
it
New
Caledonia
When
the
discovery
of
gold
on
the
Fraser
River
in
1858
brought
in
flood
of
American
adventurers
Britain
decided
it
was
time
to
take
the
land
over
from
the
Hudsonâs
Bay
Company
and
create
the
colony
of
British
Columbia
It
joined
the
Dominion
of
Canada
in
1871
on
the
understanding
that
the
Canadian
Pacific
Railway
would
reach
B.C
in
the
next
decade
(delay
nearly
caused
secession)
The
C.P.R
choice
of
Vancouver
as
its
terminus
gave
B.C
its
major
Pacific
port
The
great
boon
of
British
Columbia
at
least
in
the
southwest
corner
where
three-quarters
of
the
population
is
clustered
is
its
gentle
relatively
dry
summers
and
mild
(but
rainy)
winters
B.C.âs
kind
weather
has
been
major
factor
in
attracting
new
blood
in
the
westward
expansion
from
Ontario
QuÃ©bec
and
the
Maritimes
Trees
are
the
main
source
of
B.C.âs
prosperity
The
spruce
fir
and
cedar
provide
three-quarters
of
Canadaâs
construction
lumber
and
considerable
quantities
of
wood

and
paper
Much
to
the
joy
of
sports
fishermen
the
salmon
of
the
Pacific
coast
and
the
great
rivers
of
the
interior
remains
another
vital
natural
resource
The
threat
of
overfishing
has
been
cut
back
and
in
province
where
revenues
from
hydroelectric
power
are
second
only
to
those
of
QuÃ©bec
the
energy
industry
has
been
prevented
from
damming
the
Fraser
so
as
not
to
damage
the
salmonâs

grounds
B.C.âs
population
(4,000,000)
is
concentrated
around
the
Strait
of

and
along
the
U.S

with
scarcely
any

Vancouver
The
cityâs
setting
in
magnificent
bay
embraced
by
soaring
green
mountains
is
one
of
those
blessings
that
can
turn
any
hard-boiled
atheist
into

Cynicism
dissolves
with
your

taste
of
the

gentle

created
by
clever
combination
of
the
comforts
of
sophisticated
modernity
with
the
simpler
joys
of
the

its
back

Expanding
at
purposeful
but
more
leisurely
pace
than
other
leading
Canadian
cities
Vancouver
has
never
lost
sight
of
the
importance
of
enjoying
life
at
the
same
time
Many
business
people
from
Toronto
have
been
driven
close
to
apoplexy
by
the
relaxed
style
of
their
Vancouver
colleagues
In
keeping
with
this
easy-going
attitude
the

was
originally
known
as
Gastown

âGassy

looked
after
the
needs
of

It
was
only
when
the

became
C.P.R.âs

The
city
is
built
around
the
broad
English
Bay
which
funnels
through
First
and
Second
Narrows
into
the
Burrard
Inlet
the
waterway
that
George
Vancouver
explored
in

you
need
to
begin
from
not
one

turn
off
to

life
of
Skid

make
your

east
to
the
brighter
colors
of
Chinatown
along
Pender
Street
Canadaâs
largest
Chinese
community
made
up
of
the
descendants
of
immigrants
who
worked
on
the
Canadian
Pacific
Railway
is
much
in
evidence
in
the
fruit

vegetable
markets
fish-stalls
and
boutiques
of
silks
and
satins
bamboo
and
lacquer
wares
from
Hong
Kong
Taiwan
and
mainland
China
Look
for
the
shops
of
traditional
spices
and
medicines
where
reindeer
horn
and
deerâs
tail-tips
are
said
to
perk
up
even
the
weariest
husband
Barbecued
pork
and
poultry
glisten
in
the
windows
of
the
dozens
of
restaurants
and
tourists
are
drawn
in
by
the
garish
street
dÃ©corÂ âÂ even
the
telephone

have
pagoda-style

Away
from
the

the
Dr

at
the
corner
of

and
Pender
streets
offers
rare
moment
of

This
microcosm
of
nature
reflecting
the
Taoist
philosophy
of
yin

pavilion
with
diversity
of
glazed

tiles
carved

and
lattice

overlooks
subtly
patterned
pebblestone
courtyard
and
the
miniature
landscape
Light
is
balanced
by
shadow
and
rugged
limestone
rocks
(yang)
are
chosen
for
their
pitted
and
convoluted
surface
balancing
the
smooth
surface
of
calm
pools
and
quiet
streams
(yin)
Shrubs
symbolize
human
virtues:
pine
bamboo
and
winter-blooming
plum
represent
strength
grace
and
the
renewal
of
life
Duly
renewed
then
make
your
way
towards
the
harbor
and
railyards
to
Gastown
(between
Water
and
Hastings)
the
resuscitated
red-brick
cobbled-street
district
of
Vancouverâs
beginnings
This
hucksterâs
paradise
of
boutiques
souvenir
shops
bars
and
restaurants
is
frankly
commercial
in
its
polished
quaintness
but
with
certain
corny
charm
At
the
west
end
of
Water
Street
is
the
worldâs
first
(and
probably
only)
monumental

Escape
the
crowds
by
heading
east
along
the
waterfront
to
the
Campbell
Avenue
Docks
where
you
can
watch
the
ocean-going
fishermen
unloading
their
haul
or
join
them
for
hearty
meal
in
the
local

And
if
the

whetted
your
appetite
for
the

of

continue
this

out
along
Hastings

towards
Burnaby
Mountain
(actually

undoubtedly
one
of
North

Its
forest
of
majestic

cedars
and

remind
us
it
was
once
government
reserve
providing
mast
and
spar
timbers
for
the
Royal
Navy
At
the
turn
of
the
century
the
town
leased
it
as

named
after
Lord
Stanley
Canadaâs
governor
general
His

entrance
Turn

joy
is
the

Museum
of
Anthropology
out
on
Marine

at
Point
Grey
Arthur
Erickson
designed
this
noble
glass
and
concrete-beam
structure
in
1972
as
an
explicit
homage
to
the
post-and-beam
longhouses
of
the
Northwest
Coast
Indians
Gracing
the
lawns
are
magnificent
group
of
totem
poles
and
two
cedarwood
houses
of
the
Haida
Indians
built
in
the
1930s
and
faithful
to
centuries-old
technique
and
form
Inside
the
museum
alongside
the
artifacts
of
other
Pacific
civilizations
the
rich
culture
of
the
coastal
tribesÂ âÂ Haida
Kwakiutl
Salish
Tlingit
and
TsimshianÂ âÂ is
beautifully
displayed
and
illuminated
in
space
where
the
roof-glass
seems
to
open
the
halls
to
the
heavens
Compare
the
sturdy
cedarwood
canoes
built
to
negotiate
the
Pacificâs
coastal
waters
with
the
lighter
birchbark
craft
used
by
Eastern
Woodlands
Indians
for
the
rivers
of
Ontario
and
QuÃ©bec
Many
of
the
sculptures
you
see
were
incorporated
into
the
structure
of

totemic
animals
such
as
the

Prehistoric
stone
carvings
show
the
continuity
of
totemic
styles
Some
smaller
figures
in
soft
black
argillite
stone
were
turned
out
by
Haida
craftsmen
specifically
for
19th-century
European
tourists
who
found
themselves
âcaricaturedâ
in
the
carvings
Notice
the
huge
wooden
feast
dishes
big
as
bathtubs
for
dispensing
food
at
the
great
âpotlatchâ
ceremonies
at
which
the
tribes
proclaimed
their
greatness
by
the
munificence
of
their
hospitality
(see
page
35)
An
important
part
of
the
collection
is
devoted
to
gold
silver
and
copper
jewelry
and
wooden
masks
and
ceremonial
rattles
Many
of
these
are
kept
in
Galleries
and

but
donât
hurry
past
just
because
they
look
like
the
museumâs
store
rooms
Thatâs
what
they
are
but
this
so-called
visible
storage
system
is
major
innovation
to
make
permanently
available
the
museumâs
thousands
of
art
objects
Here
youâre
encouraged
to
make
your
own
discoveries
compare
the
work
of
different
cultures
around
the
world
and
just
admire
the
sheer
wealth
of
allegedly
âprimitiveâ
creativity
Just
to
the

the
Nitobe

Victoria
Probably
the
most
genteel
city
in
all
of
North
America
this
town
is
of
another
age
another
world
In
its
sheltered
spot
on
the
southeast
tip
of
Vancouver
Island
flowers
seem
to
be
growing
everywhere
Geraniums
in
baskets
hanging
from
five-bulb
lamp-posts
in
the
cityâs
shopping
streets;
hydrangeas
and
roses
in
the
lovingly
tended
gardens
of
the
residential
neighborhoods;
shrubs
and
more
exotic
blooms
in
the
cityâs
parks
and
conservatories
In
the
month
of
February
while
the
rest
of
Canada
is
still
huddled
around
log
fires
and
radiators
even
just
across
the
Strait
of
Georgia
in
Vancouver
the
people
of
Victoria
are
out
in
their
parks
and
gardens
for
the
annual
flower-count
Yes
they
count
every
blossom
in
town
and
the
figure
regularly
tops
the
million
mark
For
Victoria
is
blessed
with
an
exceptionally
mild
climate
with
enough
rain
to
water
the
flowers
and
an
annual
average
(they
count
everything
in
this
town)
of
2,183
hours
of
sun
to
give
them
their
brilliant
colors
Even
the
air
in
Victoria
is
sweet
and
gentle
Not
surprisingly
in

an
affluent
retirement
community
the
port
is
more
pleasure-
than
work-oriented
filling
its

with

Parliament
reminds
the
citizenry
of
the
townâs
venerable
past
and
more
serious
role
as
B.C.âs
legislative
capital
Not
that
it
detracts
from
the
hallowed
ritual
of
tea-time
act
of
obeisance
to
more
legendary
than
real
Britain
Good
for
chuckle
but
if
it
highlights
Victoriaâs
resistance
to
the
rest
of
the
planetâs
hustle
and
bustle
so
much
the
better
The
town
is
small
enough
to
get
around
on
foot
but
there
are
also
horse-drawn
carriages
and
red
double-decker
buses
from
London
The
toy-like
quality
of
Victoria
is
emphasized
in
its
most
imposing
building
the
Parliament
Built
in
1897
it
was
certainly
erected
by
someone
with
playful
sense
of
what
might
best
evoke
merry
old
England
Thereâs
bit
of
Londonâs
St
Paulâs
Cathedral
in
the
massive
central
dome
topped
for
want
of
saint
by
gilded
statue
of
Captain
George
Vancouver
The
neo-Romanesque
arched
entrance
recalls
the
British
capitalâs
Natural
Science
Museum
and
the
smaller-domed
turrets
suggest
something
between
an
Englishmanâs
castle
and
his
county
council
The
whole
fairytale
effect
is
enhanced
at
night
when
every
contour
of
the
Parliament
is
outlined
by
thousands
of
light
bulbs
Inside
you
can
visit
the
debating
chamber
unmistakably
modeled
on
the
House
of
Commons
In
the
great
domeâs
interior
rotunda
painter
George
Southwellâs
murals
illustrate
the
four
virtues
that
âmadeâ
British
Columbia:
Courage
as
shown
by
George
Vancouver
confronting
the
Spanish
at
Nootka
Sound
in
1792;
Spirit
of
Enterprise
with
James
Douglas
establishing
Fort
Victoria
for
the
Hudsonâs
Bay
Company
in
1842;
Work
by
those
who
had
to
build
the
Fort;
and
Justice
meted
out
to
the
unruly
mob
engaged
in
the
1858
gold
rush
Reasonably
enough
the
Parliament
grounds
include
bronze
statue
of
Queen
Victoria
It
was
she
who
chose
the
name
of
British
ColumbiaÂ âÂ over
New
Caledonia
New
Hanover
New
Cornwall
or
New

There
is
also
cenotaph
which
is
the
focus
of
the
annual
mid-September
Battle
of

Parade
You
can
easily
get
the
impression
that
this
town
is
only
nominally
in
Canada
Immediately
east
of

word
for
âmagnificent,â
fair
description
of
the
waters
spilling
out
of
the
outflow
of

Unlike
many
waterfalls
this
one
is
at
its
most
spectacular
on
the
hottest
summer
afternoons
when
the

The
fairytale
setting
of
this
blue
blue
lake
with
its
monumental
railway
hotel
ChÃ¢teau
Lake
Louise
has
made
it
the
mecca
of
thousands
of
sightseers
every
year
The
village
(3
km/2
miles
east)
is
very
much
tourist-trap
but
the
lake
(named
after
daughter
of
Queen
Victoria)
and
its
surroundings
retain
their
magic
From
the
hotel
terrace
before
breakfast
and
the
first
crowds
look
out
onto
the
pine
trees
and
snowy
peaks
of
Fairview
mountain
to
the

and
the
Beehive
to

north
with
the
dazzling
white
Victoria
glacier
producing
startling
reflections
on
the
shimmering
surface
of
the

Give
the
mob
the
slip
by
walking
along
clearly
marked
paths
to
the
far
end
of
the
lake
with
some
pleasant
teahouses
on
the
way
The
path
continues
to
the
Plain
of
Six
Glaciers
requiring
more
stamina
Take
the
mountain
road
14
km
(81/2

south
to
Moraine
LakeÂ âÂ nice
drive
wonderful
all-day
hikeÂ âÂ to
view
the
sawtooth
skyline
of
the
Valley
of
the
Ten
Peaks
and
the
exhilarating
climax
of
the

turquoise
waters
For

of
the
whole
area
take

Banff
National
Park
The
first
and
most
famous
of
Canadaâs
national
parks
began
as
so
many
things
in
this
country
with
the
railways
When
the
C.P.R
reached
Banff
in
1883
the
Rockies
were
suddenly
opened
up
to
public
access
and
the
government
decided
two
years
later
to
preserve
the
regionâs
beauty
by
declaring
Banff
national
park
After
three
railway
workers
discovered
hot
sulfur
springs
bubbling
from
the
earth
their
bosses
built
one
of
their
grandest
castle-hotels
the
Banff
Springs
monument
to
be
visited
even
if
youâre
not
staying
there
The
turreted
edifice
set
down
in
the
Bow
River
Valley
has
something
of
the
fairytale
castles
of
Ludwig
of
Bavaria
Take
canoe
out
on
the
river
If
youâre
feeling
less
energetic
take
the

the
Cave
and
Basin
Springs
km
(2
miles)
west
of
the
hotel
or
the
Upper
Hot
Springs
short

south
The
springs
are
29Â°C
(85Â°F)
in
winter
rising
to
42Â°C
(108Â°F)
in
summer
The
eight-minute
cable
car
ride
from
Upper
Hot
Springs
up
Sulfur
Mountain
(2,500
m/7,500
ft)
will
give
you
panoramic
view
of
the
mountains
around
the
Bow
Valley
One
of
many
fine
excursions
is
the

(140-mile)
drive
on
Highway
93
up
the
spine
of
the

to
Jasper
gives
rich
sense
of
the
Rockiesâ
varied
beautiesÂ âÂ Â glaciers
waterfalls
lakes
and
canyons
Take
full
day
so
that
you
have
time
to
explore
some
of
the
sights
on
foot
Stop
first
at
the
Crowfoot
Glacier
where
you
can
see
the
footâs
two
remaining
âtoes,â
the
third
having
broken
away
The
mass
of
ice
facing
you
is
55
(165

leave
the
Parkway
at
the
signpost
to
the
viewpoint
overlooking
the
lovely
Peyto
Lake
deep
turquoise
at
the
height
of
summer
If
you
have
time
stop
at
Kilometer
119
on
the
Parkway
to
hike
up
the
winding
path
to
Parkerâs
Ridge
(2,185
m/6,560

above
pretty
alpine
meadows
overlooking
the
Saskatchewan
Glacier
the
beginning
of
the
great
North
Saskatchewan
River
that
ends
up
in
Hudson
Bay
Inside
Jasper
National

put
on
good
rubber
or
crepesoled
shoes
to
walk
out
onto
the
ice
of
Athabasca
Glacier
part
of
the
Columbia
Icefield
You
can
also
venture
onto
the
ice
sheet
in
snowmobile
Note
the
rock
debris
or
rubble
(moraine
in
the
language
of
glaciologists)
in

of
the
glacier
showing
that
the
Athabasca
is
retreatingÂ âÂ a
hundred
years

side
of
the
Parkway

you
on
an

plunges
over
the
narrow

The
old

post
of
Jasper
is
now
refreshingly
peaceful
resort
town
with
grand
park
lodge
and
fine
facilities
for
rafting
canoeing
camping
and
other
mountain
sports
Take
the
Jasper
Tramway
ride
up
Whistlers
Mountain
for
view
of
the
Rockiesâ
highest
peak
Mount
Robson
One
of
the
most
attractive
excursions
is
the
drive
along
Maligne
Canyon
Stop
off
to
look
down
into
the
sheer
limestone
gorge
at
the
roiling
waters
sudden
cascades
and
tranquil
pools
At
the
end
of
the
canyon
is
Maligne
Lake
where
the
great
attraction
is
boat
cruise
around
the
picturesque
Spirit
Island
Alberta
This
province
of
ranches
and
oil
derricks
likes
to
cultivate
the
image
of
Canadaâs
Wild
West
If
its
politics
are
often
conservative
(opponents
compare
some
of
the
leaders
with
the
provinceâs
cherished
collection
of
dinosaurs)
they
are
of
the
adventurous
brand
favoring
Calgaryâs
rodeos
and
the
commercial
extravaganza
of
Edmontonâs
celebrated
mammoth
shopping
mall
With
the
discovery
of
huge
oil
fields
after
World
War
II
Albertaâs
economy
boomed
the
population
exploded
and
confidence
soared
The
enthusiasm
is
dampened
occasionally
by
downturns
in
world
oil
prices
but
the
atmosphere
remains
decidedly
cheerful
Alberta
is
very
conscious
of
its
geology
Alternating
600
to
200
million
years
ago
between
dry
land
and
sea
the
region
developed
plant
and
animal
life
that
decayed
to
form
the
oil
coal
and
natural
gas
at
the
base
of
the
provinceâs
modern
prosperity
Subsequent
floods
and
earthquakes
left
the
parched
Badlands
of
the
Red
Deer
River
Valley
as
protective
crust
preserving
the
skeletons
of
the
dinosaurs
They
were
discovered
by

Calgary
In
this
part
of
the
world
in
past
eras
gold
rushes
created
cities
out
of
wasteland
overnight
and
just
as
quickly
returned
them
to
dust
Soaring
Middle
East
oil
prices
seemed
to
do
the
same
thing
for
Calgary
in
the
1970s
but
the
shining
downtown
skyscrapers
that
shot
up
then
do
not
look
as
if
they
are
about
to
crumble
Not
that
Calgary
was
wasteland
when
the
post-World
War
II
oil
boom
began
but
it
was
little
more
than
cow
town
better
known
for
bronco-busting
rodeos
than
business
acumen
Population
more
than
doubled
from
280,000
in
1961
to
590,000
20
years
later
chasing
hard
behind
the
provincial
capitalÂ âÂ and
arch-rivalÂ âÂ Edmonton
The

Hotshot

the
Stampede
The
ten
days
of
the
Calgary
Stampede
in
the
first
half
of
July
are
by
any
standards
anthropological
or
purely
hedonistic
phenomenon
to
be
experienced
Cowboy
hyperbole
demands
that
it
be
known
as
the
âGreatest
Outdoor
Show
on
Earth,â
title
dating
back
to
its
beginnings
in
1912
The
Stampede
was
originally
conceived
to
show
all
the
techniques
and
excitement
of
rounding
up
cattle
on
the
prairies
Today
at
Stampede
Park
it
does
indeed
stage
agricultural
and
garden
exhibitions
displays
of
Indian
crafts
and
dancing
and
all
the
sideshows
of
country
fair
But
after
the
grand
opening
parade
of
baton-twirling
majorettes
cowboys
costumed
Indians
champion
steers
and
smiling
stars
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
the
great
attraction
remains
the
rodeo
Bareback
riding
and
bronco-busting
bull
riding
and
steer-wrestling
calf-roping
and
Indian
buffalo
riding
culminate
in
marvelous
chuck-wagon
races
The
Rangeland
Derby
as
it
is
known
races
four-horse
wagons
like
those
used
to
bring
food
out
to
the
cowboy
on
the
range
during
roundup
time
The
chuck-wagon
races
are
said
to
have
originated
when
the
last
crew
back
in
town
had
to
buy
all
the
drinksÂ âÂ now
the
prize
pot
totals
over
$200,000
Just
as
much
fun
as
the
official
events
are
the
square
dancing
in
the
streets
firework
displays
barbecue
dinners
and
flapjack
breakfasts
Spend
more
sober

in
the
fascinating
Glenbow
Museum
(130

give
vivid
picture
of
Alberta
life
from
the
pioneersâ
log-cabin
homesteads
to
the
modern
artifacts
of
oil-drillers
railway-builders
and
miners
One
evocative

dance
masks
and
snowshoes
The
shops
and

of
the
downtown

Saskatchewan
is
still
known
as
âCanadaâs

During
the
Depression
it
was
the
countryâs
poorest

close
to

But
that
all
changed
with

Itâs
been
cleaned
up
considerably
since
the
first
settlers
arrived
in
the
1880s
and
found
the
banks
of
the
Wascana
Creek
littered
with
hundreds
of
buffalo
bones
Indian
hunters
used
to
dry
their
buffalo
meat
and
stretch
the
hides
by
the
creek
and
left
the
bones
in
heap
The
town
was
known
as
Pile

until
they
were
ground

Flat
the

to
Anglo-Saxon

THE
NORTH
Every
country
needs
its
mythic
place
and
Canadaâs
is
the
fabled
North
the
icy
âwastelandâ
in
which
the
country
and
the
world
like
to
cloak
the
national
image
But
thereâs
fascinating
reality
âNorth
of
60,â
as
locals
call
the
territories
above
the
60Â°
latitude
ignored
until
recently
by
everybody
but
the
Inuit
and
other
native
people
who
live
there
plus
few
explorers
and
miners
Even
today
if
they
ever
staged
football
game
between
the
Yukon
and
the
Northwest
Territories
the
whole
population
could
be
comfortably
seated
in
the
stadium
But
more
and
more
adventurers
from
âthe
outsideâ
head
for
the
Yukonâs
rugged
mountains
or
the

eerily
beautiful

The

The

gold

did
more
than
fire
the
western

imagination

scores

immediately
opened
up

In

using
part

some
essential

WHERE
TO
GO
Youâll
need
to
plan
carefully
for
thorough
exploration
of
BerlinÂ âÂ with
total
area
of
880
sq
km
(340
sq
miles)
it
is
more
than
eight
times
the
size
of
Paris
Since
the
reorganization
of
the
municipal
transport
system
virtually
the
whole
of
the
city
is
accessible
via
underground
(U-Bahn)
overhead
(S-Bahn)
railways
bus
or
tram
You
should
have
no
difficulty
in
reaching
the
outlying
areas
including
Spandau
the
museums
in
Dahlem
the
parks
and
lakes
in
the
Grunewald
and
the
summer
palaces
in
Potsdam
by
public
transport
Busy
traffic
and
the
inevitable
parking
problems
make
car
rental
less
attractive
and
quite
unnecessary
option
good
orientation
exercise
is
to
start
with
an
organized
sightseeing
tourÂ âÂ by
bus
for
instance
departing
from
the
eastern
end
of
the
KurfÃ¼rstendamm
Cruises
on
the
Landwehrkanal
or
Spree
and
Havel
rivers
offer
more
leisurely
way
of
taking
in
areas
of
eastern
and
western
Berlin
that
are
not
normally
covered
by
the
tour
buses
The
area
on
and
around
the
KurfÃ¼rstendamm
is
probably
the
best
place
to
begin
as
itâs
very
well
served
by
information
centers
and
other
tourist
facilities
Your
first
port
of
call
should
be
the
Berlin
Tourist
Office
which
can
be
found
at
the
Budapester
StraÃe
side
of
the
Europa-Center
and
is
open
every
day;
the
helpful
multi-lingual
staff
will
assist
you
with
maps
leaflets
and
other
useful
information
Around
KurfÃ¼rstendamm
Berlinâs
main
thoroughfare
literally
âPrince
Electorâs
Embankment,â
is
known
to
Berliners
as
the
Kuâdamm
It
extends
for
1â2
km
(about
miles)
through
the
center
of
the
city
forming
triangular
area
enclosed
by
Lietzenburger
StraÃe
HardenbergstraÃe
LeibnizstraÃe
and
TauentzienstraÃe
Here
youâll
find
vast
array
of
shops
cafÃ©s
restaurants
theaters
cinemas
and
art
galleries
as
well
as
no-frills
fast-food
stands
and
the
inevitable
souvenir-sellers
Impressed
by
the
prolongation
of
the
Champs-ElysÃ©es
in
Paris
to
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
Bismarck
wanted
to
extend
the
Kuâdamm
out
as
far
as
the
Grunewald
forest
However
such
pretentions
were
never
realized
and
finally
the
avenue
linked
Kaiser
Wilhelm
Memorial
Church
to
nothing
grander
than
the
Halensee
railway
station
When
you
are
in
the
center
of
TauentzienstraÃe
notice
the
intertwined
steel
tubes
of
the
Berlin
sculpture
which
were
designed
for
the
cityâs
750th
anniversary
in
1987
The
two
halves
are
tantalizingly
close
to
each
other
yet
fail
to
touch
poignantly
symbolizing
the
once
divided
city
At
the
far
end
of
TauentzienstraÃe
Wittenbergplatz
is
large
populous
square
and
contains
one
of
Berlinâs
many
memorials:
stark
sign
outside
the
U-Bahn
station
which
reminds
passers-by
of
the
Nazi
concentration
camps
The
station
itself
is
beautifully
restored
Art
Deco
delight
with
lovely
wooden
ticket
booths
period
posters
and
central
standing
clock
More
than
just
department
store
KaDeWe
(Kaufhaus
des
Westens)
located
on
the
edge
of
Wittenbergplatz
has
achieved
the
status
of
monument
since
its
foundation
in
1907
The
food
emporium
on
the
sixth
floor
is
extraordinary
Here
gourmet
globetrotters
can
perch
on
bar
stool
and
sample
not
only
food
from
all
over
Germany
but
also
Chinese
Japanese
Russian
French
and
Swiss
cuisine
One
floor
up
the
Wintergarten
is
vast
food
court
in
the
glass-roofed
atrium
where
shoppers
can
help
themselves
to
less
exotic
but
equally
tasty
fare
Itâs
an
ideal
spot
for
hearty
breakfast
before
dayâs
shopping
The
toy
department
is
also
well
worth
visit
Breitscheidplatz
is
the
big
pedestrianized
area
at
the
base
of
the
Europa-Center
and
busy
gathering
place
for
shoppers
and
sightseers
during
the
day
In
the
center
of
the
square
is
Joachim
Schmettauâs
granite
Weltkugelbrunnen
(or
Fountain
of
the
World)
which
locals
have
gaily
christened
the
âaquatic
dumpling.â
Soaring
above
it
is
another
very
powerful
symbol
of
the
city
the
Kaiser-Wilhelm-GedÃ¤chtniskirche
The
1943
bombing
combined
with
artillery
fire
at
the
end
of
the
war
left
the
tower
with
the
broken
stump
of
its
spireÂ âÂ 63
(206
ft)
compared
with
its
original
113
(370
ft)Â âÂ as
monumental
ruin
recalling
the
cityâs
destruction
Flanking
it

On
one
wall
Wilhelm
confers
with

Moltke

With
their
taste
for
irreverent
nicknames
Berliners
have
deflated
the
monumentsâ
imperial
or
pacifist
intentions
by
dubbing
the
original
church
the
âbroken
toothâ
and
the
two
main
additions
the
âlipstickâ
and
âpowder
compact.â
Beyond
the
church
is
the
enormous
Europa-Center
between
TauentzienstraÃe
and
Budapester
StraÃe
The
center

built
in
the

Beyond
the
colorful
and
pagoda-arched
Elefantentor
(Elephant

are
35
hectares
(86
acres)
of
parkland
where
you
will
be
able
to
observe
Indian
and
African
elephants
giant
pandas
from
China
and
the
rare
single-horned
rhinoceros
from
India
Sooner
or
later
everybody
comes
to
promenade
along
the
Kuâdamm
and
suitable
vantage
point
from
which
to
survey
them
is
CafÃ©
Kranzler
Berlin
institution
at
the
corner
of
Joachimstaler
StraÃe
Itâs
now
decidedly
bourgeois
although
the
original
Kranzler
at
the
west
end
of
Unter
den
Linden
between
FriedrichstraÃe
and
the
Brandenburg
Gate
was
hotbed
of
radical
intellectuals
in
1848
The
avenue
lost
almost
all
the
Jugendstil
architecture
of
its
Wilhelminian
heyday
during
World
War
II
but
vestige
can
be
seen
in
the
elegant
CafÃ©
MÃ¶hring
just
across
the
road
Otherwise
the
street
is
resolutely
modernÂ âÂ gleaming
glass
steel
and
an
occasional
touch
of
marbleÂ âÂ but
still
magnet
for
fashionable
shopping
Like
so
much
of
the
city
this
area
is
in
constant
state
of
redevelopment
The
Berlin
Panoptikum
(Waxworks)
opens
in
2001
and
stunning
36-story
building
known
as
The
Zoo
Window
is
being
erected
Off
the
Kuâdamm
at
FasanenstraÃe
79
you
will
find
the
JÃ¼disches
Gemeindezentrum
(Jewish
Community
Center)
Framing
the
entrance
is
the
domed
portal
from
the
synagogue
which
was
burned
during
the
fateful
Kristallnacht
of
1938
(see

The
modern
building
serves
as
cultural
center
for
the
15,000
Jews
still
living
in
Berlin
todayÂ âÂ in
1933
they
numbered
some
170,000
The
Noahâs
Ark
restaurant
inside
the
Community
Center
serves
up
substantial
kosher
fare
as
well
as
holding
marvelous
Tuesday

stands
the
intimate
KÃ¤the-Kollwitz

Tiergarten
Area
Despite
its
name
the
Tiergarten
(literally
âanimal
gardenâ)
is
not
another
zoo
For
the
Hohenzollern
princes
it
was
forest
for
hunting
deer
and
wild
boar
After
Frederick
the
Great
cut
down
the
woods
to
create
formal
French
garden
for
his
brother
August
Ferdinand
it
was
replanted
with
trees
in
the
19th
century
and
transformed
into
landscaped
park
Following
World
War
II
the
Berliners
stripped
away
the
trees
againÂ âÂ for
fuel
Everything
you
will
see
here
today
has
been
planted
since
1950
among
pleasant
ponds
cafÃ©s
and
various
monuments

Officially
renamed
Haus

(House
of
World
Cultures)
the
striking
design
with
its
curved
concrete
roof
(which
was
rebuilt
after
collapsing
in
1980)
led
Berliners
to
dub
the
building
the
âpregnant

by
Paul
Wallot
This
appeal
to
patriotism

democracy
set
above
six
Corinthian
columns
outlasted
the
burning
in
1933
and
the
bombs
of

II
and
was
given
renewed
significance
when
Berlin
resumed
its
former
role
as
the
seat
of

Germany
Today
the

his
taste
for
Expressionistic

His

The
Martin-Gropius-Bau
situated
nearby
at
Stresemann
StraÃe
110
was
originally
built
between
1877
and
1881
by
Martin
Gropius
(great-uncle
of
the
Bauhausâs
Walter
Gropius)
with
the
help
of
Heino
Schmieden
as
an

the
former
School
of

which
served
as
the
headquarters
of
the

Gestapo
and
other
Nazi
institutions
Excavations
in

revealed
the
cellars
where
thousands
of

constructed
above
the
underground
quarters
of
the

of
those
who

Berlin
has
many
reminders
of
its
dark
past
but
this
has
particular
impact
Further
along
at
Askanischer
Platz
is
the
sad
but
graceful
arcaded
ruin
of
Anhalter
Bahnhof
By
an
irony
of
latterday
history
the
old
railway
station
was
the
work
of
Franz
Schwechten
the
architect
who
created
the
Kaiser

Mitte
The
area
east
of
the
Brandenburg
Gate
known
as
Mitte
(Middle)
is
the
historic
center
of
Berlin
and
was
at
one
time
the
center
of
the
capital
of
the
German
Democratic
Republic
The
cityâs
most
important
museums
theaters
government
buildings
and
churches
were
constructed
here
between
the
18th
and
20th
centuries
Many
buildings
including
the
Friedrichswerdersche
Kirche
(now
home
to
the
Schinkel-Museum
see
page
58)
and
Schinkelâs
Altes
Museum
(Old
Museum;
see
page
76)
were
carefully
restored
by
East
Germany
after
air-raid
bombing
of
World
War
II
and
several
quarters
were
rebuilt
in
the
Old
Berlin
style
notably
Gendarmenmarkt
(formerly
Platz
der
Akademie)
and
Museumsinsel
(see
page
76)
Today
the
areaâs
principal
avenue
Unter
den
Linden
has
regained
its
former
importance
as
the
main
focus
of
the
capitalâs
cultural
and
political
life
while
nearby
FriedrichstraÃe
is
once
again
becoming
fashionable
shopping
artery
with
the
opening
of
several
new
shopping
complexes
When
you
talk
to
people
here
however
itâs
worth
bearing
in
mind
that
eastern
Berlin
did
not
turn
into
bastion
of
anti-Communism
overnight
Although
the
city
voted
in
conservative
mayor
in
December
1990
the
successor
party
to
the
Communists
did
exceptionally
well
in
the
old
eastern
boroughs
still
solid
left-wing
stronghold
Brandenburg
Gate
In
spite
of
it
attracting
occasional
protest
marches
from
those
who
support
the
political
Far
Right
this
formidable
symbol
of
the
united
city
generally
appears
at
last
to
be
realizing
the
vision
of
Johann
Gottfried
Schadow
the
sculptor
who
crowned
the
Brandenburg
Gate
with
the
Quadriga
copper
statue
of
Winged
Victory
in
her
four-horse
chariot
Schadow
had
wanted
the
gate
to
be
known
as
the
Friedenstor
(Gate
of
Peace)
in
keeping
with
the
relief
of
the
Procession
of
Peace
that
he
himself
had
sculpted
beneath
Victoryâs
simple
chariot
The
gate
itself
designed
by
Carl
Gotthard
Langhans
was
built
between
1789
and
1791
With
two
rows
of
six
Doric
columns
forming
the
gateway
proper
it
was
inspired
by
the
Propylaeum
gatehouse
leading
to
the
Parthenon
in
Athens
(To
go
all
the
way
Hitler
had
even
planned
to
hoist
the
gate
onto
an
artificial
hill
in
an
attempt
to
create
mini-Acropolis.)
Forming
part
of
the
city
wall
the
gate
was
intended
by
the
more
pragmatic
Prussians
not
so
much
as
triumphal
arch
as
an
imposing
tollgate
for
collecting
duties
The
gate
was
left
isolated
in
no-manâs
land
when
the
Wall
went
up
and
subsequently
became
the
scene
of
quite
ecstatic
celebrations
when
it
came
down
though
now
you
would
scarcely
believe
it
as
Berliners
cross
nonchalantly
from
east
to
west
through
Brandenburgâs
mighty
central
arch
The
new
US
Embassy
is
being
built
nearby
on
land
originally
occupied
by
that
countryâs
pre-war
embassy
and
large
stretch
of
ground
leading
towards
Potsdamer
Platz
has
been
designated
as
the
site
of
memorial
to
the
victims
of
the
Holocaust
Unter
den
Linden
Sweeping
eastwards
from
the
gate
this
grand
61-m
(200-ft)
-wide
avenue
literally
named
âBeneath
the
Linden
Trees,â
was
Berlinâs
showcase
boulevard
Frederick
the
Great
saw
it
as
the
center
of
his
royal
capital
and
it
became
the
most
prestigious
address
in
town
Some
of
its
splendor
fell
victim
to
19th-century
building
speculation
but
the
avenue
remained
fashionable
until
the
bombs
of
World
War
II
reduced
it
to
rubble
Now
the
trees
have
been
replanted
and
the
most
important
buildings
restored
Its
western
end
is
dominated
by
the
Russian
Federation
Embassy
on
the
right
as
you
come
from

Gate
Close
by
is
the
smartest
hotel
in
town;
the
supremely
elegant

Adlon
was
recently
built
on
the
site
of
the
original
hotel
of
the
same
name
which
was
1930s
Berlin
legend
Continuing
east
you
pass
the
unprepossessing
modern
faÃ§ade
of
the
Komische
Oper
one
of
Berlinâs
most
important
opera
companies
The
ugly
exterior
is
the
result
of
post-war
reconstruction;
happily
the
magnificently
over-the-top
original
gilded
interior
has
been
retained
East
of
CharlottenstraÃe

To
recreate
the
cultural
climate
that
his
grandfather
had
brought
to
Berlin
during
the
17th
century
the
king
commissioned
new
building
to
house
the
Royal
Academy
library
an
opera
house
and
palace
for
his
brother
Prince
Heinrich
The
result
was
Heinrichâs
palace
(1748)
which
is
now
beautifully
restored
and
forms
part
of
Humboldt
UniversitÃ¤t
Founded
in
1810
by
brothers
Alexander
and
Wilhelm
Humboldt
the
institution
counted
among
its
professors
and
students
Hegel
Engels
Marx
and
Einstein
as
well
as
the
Grimm
brothers
Opposite
its
rather
severe
classicism
is
the
curving
Baroque
faÃ§ade
of
the
Alte
Bibliothek
(Old
Library)
It
stands
beside
the
open
square
named
Bebelplatz
(formerly
Opernplatz)
which
was
the
scene
of
book-burning
by
Nazi
students
in
1933
Across
Bebelplatz
you
will
find
the
grand
Palladian-style
Deutsche
Staatsoper
(German
State
Opera)
designed
in
1742
by
Knobelsdorff
Frederick
the
Greatâs
favorite
architect
To
the
east
of
the
square
the
OperncafÃ©
is
housed
in
the
Prinzessinnenpalais
the
Prussian
princessesâ
Baroque
town

Its
open-air
terrace
is
one
of
the
most
popular
places
to
meet
in
the
eastern
part
of
Berlin
while
inside
there
is
an
elegant
cafÃ©
and
restaurant
to
be
enjoyed
Beside
the
university
the
old
Prussian
army
guardhouse
the
Neue
Wache
(New
Guardhouse)
known
as
the
Mahnmal
was
Karl
Friedrich
Schinkelâs
first
important
Neo-Classical
design
completed
in
1818
It
was
rebuilt
at
the
end
of
World
War
II
as
memorial
to
victims
of
Fascism
and
militarism
Next
door
is
the
handsome
Baroque
Zeughaus
once
arsenal
for
the
Prussian
Army
as
the
sculpted
suits
of
armor
testify
along
the
roof
The
artist
Andreas
SchlÃ¼ter
provided
the
military
sculpture
but
was
able
to
assert
his
pacifist
views
with
poignant
sculpted
masks
of
dying
warriors
(1696)
in
the
inner
courtyard
named
after
him
the
SchlÃ¼terhof
Since
the
early
1950s
the

has
been
home
to

Even
the
architecture
has
been
designed
to
symbolize
the
devastation
of
Jewish
life
in
the
Holocaust
Daniel
Libeskindâs
building
was
drawing
huge
crowds
even
before
the
exhibits
of
Jewish
art
and
history
were
installed
Oranienburger
StraÃe
On
the
north
side
of
the
River
Spree
Oranienburger
StraÃe
is
the
heart
of
the
old
Jewish
quarter
In
the
1920s
diverse
community
of
Jewish
professionals
and
Bohemian
artists
and
writers
lived
worked
and
thrived
here
After
the
devastation
of
the
war
and
the
grim
sterility
of
its
aftermath
the
area
has
now
regained
much
of
its
former
vibrancy
with
cultural
centers
and
Jewish
restaurants
rubbing
shoulders
with
off-beat
cafÃ©s
and
alternative
art
venues
beneath
the
magnificent
black-and-gold-leafed
dome
of
the
Neue
Synagogue
The
biggest
synagogue
in
Germany
designed
by
Eduard
Knoblauch
and
completed
in
1866
it
was
gutted
during
the
anti-Semitic
attacks
of
Kristallnacht
on
November
1938
(see
page
21)
and
then
later
destroyed
by
Allied
bombing
It
has
now
been
beautifully
restored
and
is
used
for
services
once
more
In
addition
exhibits
from
the
adjacent
center
of
Jewish
studies
Centrum
Judaicum
are
displayed
here
Nearby
Hackesche
HÃ¶fe
is
fascinating
complex
of
early
20th
century
interconnecting
courtyards
This
has
recently
been
restored
and
is
now
lively
spot
with
bars

and
offices
complete
with
its
own
theater
Karl-Liebknecht-StraÃe
Linking
Unter
den
Linden
to
Karl-Liebknecht-StraÃe
is
the
19th
century
SchloÃbrÃ¼cke
(Palace
Bridge)
designed
by
Schinkel
in
1820â1824
and
decorated
with
fierce
warriors
and
victory
goddesses
Beyond
the
bridge
look
left
to
the
imposing
Neo-Classical
faÃ§ade
of
the
Altes
Museum
at
the
far
end
of
the
Lustgarten
(Pleasure
Garden)
which
forms
grand
entrance
to
Museumsinsel
the
site
of
eastern
Berlinâs
most
important
museums
(see
page

On
the
opposite
side
of
the
Lustgarten
stands
the
area
once
more
known
as
Schlossplatz
Under
the
GDR
its
name
was
changed
to
Marx-Engels-Platz
and
it
became
focus
of
Communist
May
Day
military
parades
and
rallies
The
war-damaged
StadtschloÃ
(City
Palace)
of
the
Hohenzollerns
once
stood
here
However
in
1950
Walter
Ulbricht
decided
to
raze
it
as
symbolizing
German
imperialism
despite
protests
from
art
historians
that
it
was
the
cityâs
outstanding
Baroque
building
(You
can
see
model
of
the
palace
in
the
historical
apartments
at
SchloÃ
Charlottenburg

The
palace
balcony
from
which
Spartacist
leader
Karl
Liebknecht
proclaimed
his
doomed
âSocialist
Republicâ
in
1918
was
added
to
the
front
of
the
Staatsrat
(Council
of
State)
building
on
the
east
side
of
the
square
while
the
monstrous
bronze
glass
and

Palast

Republik
once
not
so
very
long
ago
the
seat
of
East
Germanyâs
parliament
replaced
what
remained
of
the
royal
residence
Recent
budget
cuts
have
postponed
the
demolition
of
the
Palast
and
there
is
movement
afoot
to
preserve
it
as
an
historic
monument
On
the
opposite
side
the
exterior
of
Kaiser
Wilhelm
IIâs
Berliner
Dom
has
been
completely
restored
and
its
interior
beautifully
renovated
despite
sustaining
heavy
bomb
damage
during
the
Second
World
War
The
cathedral
acts
as
place
of

The
Neo-Renaissance
Berliner
Rathaus
also
known
as
the
Rotes
Rathaus
(Red
Town
Hall)
owes
its
nickname
to
its
red
clinker
masonry
not
its
ideology
Built
between
1861
and
1869
it
is
now
the
seat
of
the
cityâs
governing
mayor
and
is
decorated
with
an
interesting
terracotta
frieze
chronicling
the
history
of
Berlin
up
to
the
time
of
the
buildingâs
construction
Beyond

Neptunbrunnen
(Neptuneâs
Fountain)
rather
elaborate
affair
decorated
with
four
figures
representing
the
rivers
Rhine
Elbe
Oder
and
Weichsel
you
can
hardly
miss
the
Fernsehturm
(Television
Tower)
rising
up
above
Alexanderplatz
It
was
built
in
1969
and
at

absolutely
dwarfs

Alexanderplatz
âAlex,â
as
the
huge
square
is
known
was
once
the
undisputed
heart
of
pre-war
Berlin
and
its
vibrancy
was
celebrated
in
Alfred
DÃ¶blinâs
great
1929
novel
Berlin
Alexanderplatz
later
filmed
by
Rainer
Werner

Today
the
square
is
rather
bleak
and
desolate
place
with
fountain
and
circular
World
Clock
surrounded
by
grim
graffiti-ridden
Communist
architecture
However
plans
are
afoot
to
knock
down
and
rebuild
part
of
the
area
and
restore
some
of
the
squareâs
former
vitality

SchloÃ
Charlottenburg
was
conceived
as

in
the
1690s
when
the
site
beside
the
River

crowded
spot
where
city-dwellers
come

Pfaueninsel
(Peacock
Island)
delightfully
tranquil
nature
reserve
in
the
Havel
towards
the
northern
edge
of
Berliner
Forst
The
island
menagerie
was
used
to
stock
the
Berlin
Zoo
but
the
bird
sanctuary
still
has
much
to
offer
the
nature-lover
including
of
course
peacocks
At
the
southern
tip
half
hidden
in
the
trees
is
Schinkelâs
Swiss
Cottage
but
the
islandâs
principal
curiosity
is
the

Spandau
With

longer
than
Berlinâs
Spandau
northwest
of
Berlin
still
remains
fiercely
independent-minded
and
was
the
most
reluctant
of
the
townships
to
be
annexed
by
the
metropolis
in
1920
The
town
is
easily
reached
by
U-Bahn
and
if
you
have
time
to
spare
is
well
worth
visiting
for
its
old
restored
quarter
and
16th-century
citadel
the
venue
for
regular
summer
festivals
of
jazz
and
classical
music
The
Altstadt
(old

was
less

Zitadelle
(citadel)
in

of
heavy
fighting
in
the
Napoleonic
Wars
Its
walls

It
was
the

Like
Spandau

KÃ¶penick
has
longer
history
than
Berlin
itself

which
is
not

Potsdam
were
transferred
to

Berlinâs
museums
were
again
in
state
of
flux
but
this
situation
is
now
coming
to
an
end
as

settle
into
their

third
great
treasure
is
the
Roman

belies
the
true
character

which
constitutes
both

Babelsberg
The
small
suburb
of
Babelsberg
to
the
east
of
Potsdam
was
home
to
the
film
industry
which
rivaled
Hollywood
in
the

Where
to
Go
Bermuda
is
small
group
of
islands
and
thus
relatively
easy
to
explore
Distances
are
short
here
so
the
unavailability
of
rental
cars
(theyâre
off-limits
to
tourists!)
is
really
plus
It
means
youâll
be
on
buses
taxis
bicycles
or
mopedsÂ âÂ or
on
footÂ âÂ to
enjoy
Bermudaâs
many
pleasures
And
the
pace
is
relaxed;
speed
limits
are
only
32
km/h
(20
mph)
Around
every
corner
there
are
beautiful
views
elegant
architecture
and
exquisite
natural
areas
Combine
this
with
wealth
of
historical
attractions
museums
forts
and
churches
and
Bermuda
is
an
explorerâs
delight
We
start
our
tour
at
Hamilton
the
capital
then
travel
from
this
center
first
to
the
south
and
west
and
then
to
the
east
and
north
Hamilton
The
capital
of
Bermuda
since
1815
Hamilton
is
very
small
and
friendly
city
despite
its
importance
in
the
world
of
finance
banking
and
insurance
It
is
the
heart
of
government
and
decision
making
and
because
it
is
the
only
container
port
on
the
island
it
is
also
the
center
of
shipping
and
trade
Local
people
gravitate
here
for
shopping
and
entertainment
and
visitors
crowd
the
streets
in
summer
when
the
cruise
ships
are
in
town
Front
Street
runs
along
the
water
and
is
the
first
part
of
town
seen
by
cruise
passengers
as
ships
come
to
shore
It
is
the
life
and
soul
of
Hamilton
and
focus
for
many
activities
especially
during
the
summer
months
long
row
of
pastel-painted
buildings
offer
the
best
in
tax-free
shopping:
jewelry
liquor
clothing
and
crystal
Explore
the
narrow
alleyways
that
lead
off
Front
Street
to
discover
small
shops
selling
collectibles
or
locally
designed
arts
and
crafts
or
small
restaurants
offering
local
seafood
On
Front
Street
itself
there
are
number
of
restaurants
with
verandas
on
the
first
floor
where
you
can
have
drink
or
meal
and
watch
the
world
go
by
At
the
west
end
of
Front
Street
on
the
waterfront
you
will
find
the
Visitor
Service
Bureau
and
the
terminal
for
the
local
ferries
that
ply
across
Great
and
Little
Sound
from
Hamilton
to
the
southern
and
western
parts
of
Bermuda
On
summer
evenings
Front
Street
comes
alive
with
Harbour
Night
Street
performers
craft
stalls
and
late-night
shopping
are
all
part
of
the
festivities
There
is
also
the
Beat
Retreat
Ceremony
where
the
Band
and
Corps
of
Drums
of
the
Bermuda
Regiment
and
the
Bermuda
Islands
Pipe
Band
in
full
military
dress
march
the
street
to
recreate
centuries-old
ceremony
Most
of
Hamiltonâs
attractions
can
be
seen
on
foot
and
would
make
an
enjoyable
dayâs
stroll
But
there
is
also
the
option
of
taking
carriage
ride
through
the
streetsÂ âÂ thereâs
nothing
more
romantic
than
horse-drawn
carriage
taking
stately
route
Carriages
can
be
hired
on
Front
Street
during
the
summer
season
On
foot
your
tour
might
begin
at
the
head
office
of
the
Bank
of
Bermuda
which
is
on
Front
Street
behind
the
Ferry
Terminal
This
is
one
of
the
few
âhigh-riseâ
buildings
in
Hamilton
as
most
of
the
townâs
structures
are
less
than
three
stories
in
height
The
formal
faÃ§ade
has
number
of
heraldic
plaques
signifying
its
ancient
pedigree
Inside
the
bank
keeps
collection
of
rare
and
valuable
coins
dating
back
through
Bermudaâs
history
Every
type
of
coin
minted
by
the
British
crown
can
be
found
here
from
the
time
of
James
in
1603
(when
the
charter
was
granted
that
brought
Bermudaâs
first
settlers)
to
the
present
day
including
an
example
of
âHogâ
money
Be
sure
to
see
the
1887
Â£5
coin
which
caused
consternation
among
British
subjects
of
the
time
Because
the
crown
pictured
on
Queen
Victoriaâs
head
was
far
too
small
many
people
thought
that
the
Queen
(and
by
extension
the
empire)
looked
ridiculous
From
the
bank
head
for
Queen
Street
which
leads
north
from
the
Birdcage
metal
cage
once
used
by
police
officers
to
direct
the
traffic
that
regularly
comes
to
halt
on
Front
Street
It
was
designed
by
Mr
Bird
although
it
also
has
resemblance
to
âTweetie
Birdâsâ
cage
Traffic
lights
now
regulate
the
junction
Remember
to
look
right
as
you
prepare
to
cross
the
road!
On
the
left
as
you
walk
up
Queen
Street
is
Perot
Post
Office
named
after
the
man
who
was
appointed
Bermudaâs
first
Postmaster
General
in
1821
He
had
actually
been
acting
as
âunofficialâ
postman
for
several
years
meeting
the
ships
and
putting
the
letters
under
his
hat
before
touring
the
town
to
deliver
them
William
B
Perot
(pronounced
âPea-rutâ)
went
one
stage
further
in
1848
when
he
began
to
produce
his
own
postage
stamps;
only
11
are
known
to
exist
today
making
each
one
extremely
valuable
The
little
Post
Office
is
very
much
as
Perot
kept
it
neat
and
simply
furnished
The
building
still
houses
an
active
post
office
which
makes
it
an
appropriate
place
to
buy
the
stamps
for
your
postcards
Bermudian
stamps
always
have
colorful
and
interesting
design;
perhaps
you
can
start
collection
by
buying
set
for
yourself
Just
behind
the
Post
Office
is
building
that
houses
the
Bermuda
National
Library
and
the
Historical
Society
Museum
prime
collections
devoted
to
important
historical
documents
and
artifacts
from
the
island
The
public
rooms
are
small
but
full
of
Bermudian
treasures
Silver
china
coins
and
furniture
have
been
gathered
together
including
rare
and
valuable
âhogâ
money
as
well
as
some
of
the
Confederate
notes
that
were
used
to
pay
for
goods
before
the
Civil
War
Many
Bermudian
businessmen
and
sailors
were
paid
in
money
that
became
worthless
after
the
Unionists
won
the
war
The
house
is
set
in
gardens
now
called
Par-la-Ville
Park
that
are
open
to
the
public
daily
Here
you
will
find
businessmen
eating
lunch
chattering
school
children
and
family
of
cats
who
call
the
place
home
Perot
planned
the
gardens
during
his
time
at
the
Post
Office
and
the
spot
has
changed
very
little
since
that
time
Queen
Street
climbs
as
far
as
Church
Street
main
east-west
thoroughfare
named
for
the
many
houses
of
worship
located
along
its
course
When
you
reach
Church
Street
take
right
turn
little
way
up
the
street
on
the
left
is
the
Hamilton
City
Hall
and
Arts
Centre
bright
white
building
with
distinctive
painted
clock
on
the
front
facade
It

originally
childrenâs
playground
but
later
landscaped
to
commemorate
the
Silver

The
main
features
are
the
sunken
garden
lawns
and
flowerbeds
in
traditional
English
style
and

weekdays
only
Perhaps
the
most
dramatic
area
in
the
church
is
the
wall
behind
the
altar
where
there
are
sculptures
in
niches
depicting
Christ
and
the
saints
Completed
in
1967
it
is
fitting
modern

to
the
church
By
contrast
farther
along
Church
Street
is
the
oldest
church
in
Hamilton
St
Andrewâs
Presbyterian
Church
(founded
in
1843)
as
well
as

Parliament
Street
to
reach
the
front
of
the
building
Sessions
House
dates
from
1819
but
the

were
added
in
1887
for
the
Silver
Jubilee
Bermudaâs
parliament
is
the
second
oldest
in
the
British
Commonwealth
and
is
still
modeled
after
its
predecessor
in
London
The

The
Supreme
Court
can
also
be
viewed
and
is
in
session
throughout
the
year
The
home
of
the
Bermuda
Senate
is
farther
down
Parliament

at
Cabinet
House
(built
in
1833)
where
the
premier

speech
is
given
from
Bermuda
Cedar
seat
fashioned
in
1642
when
meetings
were
still
held
in
St
Georgeâs
Bermudaâs
Senate
has
no
legislative
powers
and
is
rather
more
of
debating
forum;
its
sessions
can
be
observed
on
Wednesdays
Outside
the
Cabinet
building
on
Front
Street
is
the
Cenotaph
which
commemorates
Bermudaâs
dead
of
the
two
World
Wars
The
monument
dates
from
1920
its
design
based
on
that
of
the
war
memorial
that
stands
in
Londonâs
Whitehall
The
solemn
ceremonies
of
Remembrance
Day
take
place
here
on
11
November
each
year
when
wreaths
are
laid
and
silent
homage
is
paid
to
those
who
gave
their
lives
From
Front
Street
ten-minute

the
steep
incline
of
King
Street
leads
to
Fort
Hamilton
which
was
built
in
1889
to
protect
the
harbor
and
formed
part
of
line
of
defense
for
the
naval
dockyard
to
the
west
Today
it
offers
spectacular
views
over
the
rooftops
of
Hamilton
especially
thrilling
when
the
cruise
ships
are
in
port
The
upper
levels
and
battlements
have
been
landscaped
with
fine
lawns
which
make
fine
place
for
summer
picnic
Long
cool
tunnels
in
the
depths
of
the
defenses
were
originally
dug
as
protected
route
for
ammunition
replenishment
They
also
lead
to
the
deep
moat
once
the
first
line
of
protection
against
manned
assault
but
now
converted
into
splendid
tropical
garden
with
varieties
of
giant
bamboo
fern
and
ficus
Creeping
plants
now
climb
the
sheer
walls
providing
new

yet
only
few
minutes
walk
from
the
shops
and
restaurants
of
the
town
center
is
the
Bermuda
Underwater
Exploration
Institute
which
celebrates
the
important
part
Bermuda
has
played

of
this
fledgling
science
and
sport
The
building
has
light
and
spacious
modern
design
offering
the
chance
to
wander
easily
among
the
exhibits
short
video
tells
the
story
of
the
development
of
the
Bathysphere
machine
that
could
withstand
the
immense
water
pressure
thousands
of
feet
beneath
the
surface
so
that
scientists
could
study
the
creatures
living
at
those
depths
Displays
explain
how
seashell
is
created
and
in
the
next
room
the
Stonington
Collection
comprises
5000
different
seashell
varieties
from
around
the
world
including
many
found
in

the
approximate
depth
of
the
Atlantic
in
the
waters
surrounding
Bermudaâs
shallow
coral
reefs
The
introduction
to
the
âdiveâ
paints
vivid
picture
of
the
geology
of
Bermuda
and
its
incredible
position
in
the
middle
of
this
vast
deep
ocean
Your
journey
leads
through
re-creations
of
the
environments
found
at
several
different
ocean
layers
then
on
to
displays
of
treasure
salvaged
from
wrecks
around
the
island
The
whole
exhibit
makes
you
appreciate
the
work
of
the
ferry
pilots
who
guide
ships
in
and
out
of
the
treacherous
reefs
surrounding
Bermuda
Spanish
Point
Northwest
of
the
city
of
Hamilton
in
Pembroke
Parish
lies
small
area
of
land
reaching
out
into
the
mouth
of
Great
Sound
Vehicles
reach
this
area
through
Black
Watch
Pass
cutting
through
the
high
coral
cliff
that
was
opened
in
1934
Over
2.5
million
tons
of
rock
were
removed
to
create
the
first
route
over
the
North
Shore
Cliffs
The
road
(bus
route
#4)
ends
at
Spanish
Point
and
the
small
Stovel
Bay
where
there
is
picturesque
park
with
views
of
the
distant
dockyard
across
the
strait
An
intriguing
wreck
lies
at
Spanish
Point
part
of
the
floating
dock
(the
second
largest
in
the
world)
that
once
sat
at
the
Royal
Naval
Dockyard
It
was
being
towed
out
of
the
harbor
for
scrap
but
broke
loose
from
its
ties
and
foundered
on
rocks
here
never
to
be
moved
again
South
and
West
from
Hamilton
The
journey
out
of
Hamilton
to
the
south
leads
through
the
parishes
of
Paget
Warwick
and
Southampton
before
reaching
Sandys
Parish
where
the
âhookâ
of
Bermuda
curves
up
to
Somerset
and
Ireland
islands
The
south
coast
has
miles
of
sublime
pink-sand
beaches
and
reef
wall
that
parallels
the
coastline
After
the
spectacular
panorama
viewed
from
Gibbâs
Hill
Lighthouse
(on
one
of
Bermudaâs
highest
points)
the
land
narrows
to
string
of
small
islands
held
together
by
series
of
small
bridges
leading
eventually
to
the
sites
of
Britainâs
former
glory
Leave
Hamilton
by
traveling
east
on
Front
StreetÂ âÂ with
the
harbor
on
your
rightÂ âÂ until
you
reach
traffic
circle
(roundabout)
Take
the
âFoot
of
the
Lane,â
then
turn
onto
Pomander
Road
to
reach
Waterville
historic
home
and
now
headquarters
for
the
Bermuda
National
Trust
The
home
belonged
to
the
Trimingham
family
prominent
business
people
and
traders
who
still
operate
the
best-known
department
store
chain
on
the
island
James
Harvey
Trimingham
began
trading
from
the
Waterville
site
in
1842
and
opened
the
Front
Street
Store
(still
in
business)
in
1861
The
house
one
of
the
oldest
on
Bermuda
was
built
around
1725
on
land
bought
by
John
Trimingham
II
Originally
the
family
built
ships
and
operated
wharf
in
front
of
the
house
âat
the
foot
of
the
Lane,â
as
the
end
of
Hamilton
Harbour
was
then
known
The
bottom
floor
of
the
house
was
used
to
store
goods
and
equipment
while
the
upper
floor
provided
living
quarters
In
1961
the
house
was
acquired
by
the
Historic
Monuments
Trust
precursor
to
the
Bermuda
National
Trust
but
it
was
still
occupied
by
elderly
Trimingham
family
members
until
1990
Two
rooms
on
the
upper
level
are
open
to
the
public
where
Trimingham
furniture
and
family
portraits
can
be
seen
Just
as
popular
are
the
gardens
set
against
the
waterâs
edge
300-year-old
tamarind
tree
sheds
comforting
shade
over
the
house
and
ducks
come
from
the
water
to
share
your
sandwiches
If
you
turn
up
Berry
Hill
Road
at
the
same
roundabout
you
will
find
the
entrance
to
the
Botanical
Gardens
and
Camden
(bus
route
#1)
Camden
was
designated
as
the
official
residence
of
Bermudaâs
premier
after
self-government
began
in
1970
It
is
an
impressive
colonial
building
with
painted
shutters
and
fretwork
The
Botanical
Gardens
that
surround
the
house
were
inaugurated
in
1898
and
doubled
in
size
to
15
hectares
(36
acres)
in
1921
There
are
large
glass
houses
with
cacti
and
orchids
along
with
formal
gardens
lawns
and
an
aromatic
garden
designed
for
the
enjoyment
of
blind
visitors
There
are
also
tables
under
the
trees
in
the
rolling
landscape
in
front
of
Camden
for
picnics
The
whole
area
is
delight
for
plant
lovers
and
anyone
else
who
wants
pleasant
spot
to
relax
Leaving
Hamilton
You
can
take
three
main
routes
to
travel
south
and
west
along
Bermudaâs
âfish-hook.â
The
northernmost
(called
most
appropriately
Harbour
Road)
leads
along
the
south
shore
of
Hamilton
Harbour
with
views
of
the
islands
that
lie
scattered
in
Great
Sound
and
make
navigation
into
the
cruise
port
so
tricky
number
of
ferry
terminals
on
the
Hamilton-Warwick
and
Hamilton-Paget
routes
can
be
found
on
Harbour
Road
as
can
many
hotels
and
guest
houses
away
from
the
bustle
of
Hamilton
but
within
easy
reach
of
all
its
facilities
The
middle
route
(up
Crow
Lane
and
Stone
Hill
to
Middle
Road)
is
the
most
direct
if
you
are
in
hurry
It
leads
past
the
Belmont
Country
Club
and
Hotel
with
its
fine
golf
course
and
later
passes
the
Waterlot
Inn
one
of
the
finest
restaurants
on
the
island
The
building
is
from
the
17th
century
and
occupies
setting
at
the
head
of
pretty
bay
(bus
route
#8)
The
most
southerly
road
(South

is
the
most
scenic
and
leads
to
some
of
the
best
beaches
and
finest
resorts
on
Bermuda
(bus
route
#7)
The
South
Road
You
will
come
first
to
the
Elbow
Beach
Resort
and
the
nearby
public
Bermuda
Beach
The
resort
is
one
of
the
premier
hotels
on
the
island
and
sits
on
long
stretch
of
sand
that
is
for
hotel
guests
exclusively
South
Road
travels
on
top
of
the
cliffs
and
offers
beautiful
views
of
the
sand
dunes
and
beaches
below
Donât
worry
about
trying
to
take
in
these
views
while
driving
for
there
are
many
stopping
places
along
the
way
where
you
can
take
photographs
or
simply
enjoy
the
panorama
The
way
to
each
beach
is
marked
with
wooden
sign
which
leads
to
parking
areas
for
bicycles
and
cars
off
the
main
road
Once
you
reach
Warwick
Long
Bay
there
are
series
of
public
beaches
that
allow
you
to
walk
along
the
sand
or
find
patch
to
call
your
own
for
the
day
Miles
of
footpaths
in
the
dunes
and
undulating
grassland
behind
the
beaches
have
been
designated
as
South
Shore
Park
These
areas
are
perfect
for
walking
jogging
or
horseback
riding
(see
box
opposite)
The
most
southerly
of
the
beaches
fronting
South
Shore
Park
is
Horseshoe
Bay
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
photographed
on
Bermuda
crescent
of
fine
pink-tinged
sand
with
good
facilities
including
restaurant/cafÃ©
it
makes
good
starting
or
finishing
point
for
your
explorations
The
next
bay
to
Horseshoe
Bay
is
East
Whale
Bay
the
private
beach
of
the
Southampton
Princess
Hotel
which
sits
majestically
on
the
hills
above
From
the
main
road
the
hotel
is
easily
seen
with
its
pale
pink
color
Below
are
the
greens
and
fairways
of
the
Princessâs
executive
golf
course
always
busy
with

Turn
right
beyond
the
Henry
VIII
restaurant
to
reach
Gibbâs
Hill
Lighthouse
which
still
plays
an
important
role
in
protecting
ships
passing
through
the
waters
close
to
Bermuda
Built
in
1844
it
is
one
of
the
worldâs
few
remaining
lighthouses
to
be
constructed
of
iron
The
light
which
is
now
fully
automated
can
be
seen
by
boats
64
km
(40
miles)
away
Take
the
185
steps
to
the
top
for
panoramic
views
of
the
island
When
Britainâs
Queen
Elizabeth
II
made
an
official
visit
to
the
lighthouse
she
stopped
at
the
roadside
below
to
admire
the
view
toward
Riddellâs
Bay
and
the
islands
of
Great
Sound
small
bronze
plaque
now
marks
the
site
designated
Queenâs

where
you
can
look
at
the
landscape
only
slightly
altered
through
the
passage
of
time
To
the
West
End
One
mile
beyond
the
lighthouse
South
Road
joins
Middle
Road
which
continues
on
toward
Bermudaâs
West
End
(bus
routes
#7
and
#8)
Vestiges
of
the
Railway
Trail
intertwine
with
the
road
in
this
area
Half
mile
from
the
junction
look
out
for
Industrial
Park
Road
on
the
left
where
you
will
find
Bermuda
Triangle
Brewing
It
produces
such
memorable
concoctions
as
Wilde
Hogge
and
Hammerhead
The
brewery
offers
guided
tours
that
demonstrate
the
brewing
process
from
fermentation
to
bottling
with
free
samples
of
freshly
brewed
beer
In
the
summer
months
there
are
tours
daily
at
4pm;
in
winter
the
tours
are
on
Saturday
only
Farther
along
Middle
Road
small
lane
leads
to
West
Whale
Bay
small
body
of
water
that
got
its
name
from
the
whales
that
were
slaughtered
here
in
years
gone
by
Port
Royal
Golf
Course
one
of
the
oldest
on
the
island
fills
much
of
this
area
before
the
road
leads
on
to
Somerset
Island
West
End:
Somerset
and
Ireland
Islands
The
bridge
that
connects
Somerset
Island
and
its
parish
of
Sandys
(pronounced
âSandsâ)
to
the
main
island
is
quite
short
If
you
travelled
on
immediately
it
would
be
easy
to
miss
one
of
the
curiosities
of
Bermuda
for
Somerset
Bridge
is
said
to
be
the
narrowest
drawbridge
in
the
world
The
section
which
opens
is
wide
enough
to
allow
the
passage
of
only
boatâs
mast!
It
is
operated
by
simply
lifting
two
planks
of
wood
by
hand;
one
has
to
marvel
at
the
skill
of
the
sailors
who
use
the
bridge
regularly
The
bridge
and
surrounding
supports
were
renovated
in
1998
The
ferry
service
from
Hamilton
also
stops
here
on
its
way
to
Dockyard
Take
the
ferry
or
walk
along
the
old
Bermuda
Railway
Trail
which
is
extremely
scenic
along
this
section
There
are
several
deep
âcutsâ
created
for
the
rail
line
with
tiny
wooden
foot
bridges
over
the
top
The
road
into
Somerset
Island
leads
around
pretty
bay
and
onto
Fort
Scaur
which
stands
on
rocky
hillock
hidden
from
the
road
The
fort
was
begun
in
1869
to
protect
the
land
route
to
the
naval
dockyard
at
the
end
of
the
island
The
layout
is
the
so-called
Prussian
design
polygon
shape
developed
by
German
engineers
at
the
time
The
gunning
placements
held
âdisappearingâ
guns
which
could
not
be
seen
from
land
or
sea
Other
gunning
placements
were
also
added
by
US
engineers
during
World
War
II
sturdy
caponier
(a
small
fortified
room
with
openings
for
rifles)
was
to
act
as
last
defense
if
the
battlements
were
overrun
It
was
never
needed
as
the
fort
never
saw
any
action
and
today
the
ramparts
offer
panoramic
views
of
Great
Sound
There
are
hectares
(22
acres)
of
grassland
all
around
the
fort
where
you
can
enjoy
picnic
Just
beyond
the
fort
watch
out
for
narrow
lane
to
the
right
with
sign
for
the
Heydon
Trust
Chapel
This
simple
place
of
worship
on
land
set
aside
for
personal
reflection
is
open
at
all
hours
for
those
who
want
to
come
and
pray
(The
building
is
listed
on
maps
of
1616
as
personal
residence.)
Visitors
can
admire
the
architecture
and
see
the
old
water
storage
tank
that
collects
water
for
use
inside
The
village
of
Somerset
lies
only
half
mile
beyond
the
fort
It
is
small
settlement
but
has
many
shops
that
are
branches
of
larger
Hamilton
stores
and
also
couple
of
well-regarded
restaurants
for
leisurely
lunch
Off
its
far
northern
tip
Somerset
Island
is
attached
by
bridge
to
string
of
smaller
islands:
Watford
Island
Boaz
Island
and
Ireland
Island
It
is
on
Ireland
Island
South
where
you
will
find
the
Royal
Naval
Cemetery
set
beside
the
main
road
All
navy
personnel
were
buried
here
along
with
many
civilian
workers
needed
to
run
the
base
stroll
along
the
footpath
allows
you
to
read
some
of
the
sad
ends
that
they
suffered
Sunstroke
and
yellow
fever
appear
as
common
causes
of
death
So
too
does
drowning
from
accidents
in
the
frequent
winter
squalls
that
caught
sailors
unaware
Many
sailors
could
not
swim
so
being
lost
overboard
was
fate
they
all
dreaded
The
Royal
Naval
Dockyard
It
was
the
Duke
of
Wellington
who
in
1809
vowed
to
make
Bermuda
the
âGibraltar
of
the
Westâ
and
created
plan
for
massive
naval
base
on
the
island
The
whole
project
demanded
far
more
labor
than
existed
in
the
colony
so
Crown
prisoners
were
shipped
here
to
complete
the
task
They
were
billeted
in
ships
brought
over
from
Britain
which
were
then
tied
up
at
dockside
The
âhulksâ
(as
the
boats
were
known)
were
overcrowded
and
unsanitary
Many
died
from
disease
and
malnutrition
before
the
work
was
complete
but
the
dockyard
proved
to
be
bastion
of
the
British
Empire
and
served
to
protect
the
motherland
even
as
recently
as
World
War
II
Postwar
the
British
military
presence
dwindled
and
the
main
sections
of
the
dockyard
were
closed
in
1951
They
were
deserted
for
number
of
years
before
being
brought
to
life
as
tourist
attraction
Today
the
Royal
Naval
Dockyard
on
Ireland
Island
North
has
been
reborn
with
number
of
sights
and
activities
You
could
certainly
spend
morning
or
an
afternoon
exploring
here
Start
your
tour
at
the
Bermuda
Maritime
Museum
opened
in
1975
by
Queen
Elizabeth
II
If
traveling
by
bus
(Routes
#7
or
#8)
you
will
alight
at
the
last
stop;
arriving
by
ferry
you
should
turn
right
from
the
ferry
port
and
follow
the
footpath
around
the
dock
where
you
will
see
the
walls
of
the
central
fortress
(or
âkeepâ)
rising
in
front
of
you
The
museum
is
entered
through
large
archway
beyond
moat
It
covers
21â2
hectares
(6
acres)
and
various
collections
are
housed
in
the
old
brick
military
buildings
most
of
which
date
from
the
Victorian
era
Where
ordnance
was
once
stored
there
are
now
collections
of
coins
and
treasure
salvaged
from
the
ocean
floor
You
will
also
find
displays
of
diving
equipment
used
over
the
centuries
to
explore
the
shipwrecks
that
can
be
found
all
around
the
treacherous
reefs
off
the
coast
here
The
Boat
Loft
houses
collection
reflecting
Bermudaâs
innovative
local
designs
including
fully
rigged
gleamingly
polished
âfitted
dinghy,â
famed
for
the
size
of
its
enormous
sail
Such
boats
were
developed
to
allow
quick
access
to
incoming
ships
In
the
early
days
pilots
were
in
competition
with
each
other
to
reach
incoming
cargoes
first
and
thus
secure
the
business
The
exhibit
also
details
the
role
Bermuda
has
played
in
the
world
of
competitive
sailing
On
an
island
where
shipbuilding
was
an
important
industry
men
had
the
skills
to
design
and
produce
fast
boats
Racing
started
as
an
informal
pastime
but
in
1840
Samuel
Triscott
(a
local
victualer)
organized
the
first
regatta
The
Bermuda
Royal
Yacht
Club
was
organized
in
1844
for
gentlemen
yachtsmen
not
long
after
the
founding
of
the
Bermuda
Native
Yacht
Club
(BNYC)
for
native
boatmen
(many
of
whom
were
working
pilots
and
crewmen)
After
looking
around
these
collections
climb
the
hill
to
the
Commissionerâs
House
where
you
will
find
fine
views
of
the
surrounding
coastline
and
the
rest
of
the
dockyard
complex
The
house
with
wonderful
large
rooms
befits
its
role
as
home
to
what
was
once
the
most
powerful
man
on
the
island
The
whole
structure
is
supported
by
an
iron
foundation
said
to
be
hurricane-proof
In
the
old
Cooperage
across
the
road
from
the
Museum
are
the
Craft
Centre
and
the
Arts
Centre
both
great
places
to
search
for
Bermudian
souvenir
The
most
renowned
working
artists
have
studio
spaces
here
with
displays
of
local
work
using
such
raw
materials
as
wood
sea
shells
and
flowers
Walk
through
the
Cooperage
to
reach
the
Victualing
Yard
where
you
will
find
the
Tourist
Information
Bureau
then
across
the
park
and
around
the
dry
dock
area
which
is
still
used
to
repair
the
boats
and
buoys
so
vital
to
ship
safety
On
the
left
is
the
Bermuda
Pottery
where
youâll
find
experts
crafting
and
firing
ceramics
with
series
of
island
motifs
Your
walk
will
then
lead
to
the
Clocktower
Building
perhaps
the
most
elegant
of
the
structures
at
dockyard
Its
long
lines
and
minimalist
faÃ§ade
once
housed
administrative
offices
but
the
interior
has
been
transformed
into
smart
shopping
mall
with
luxury
goods
from
jewelry
to
cigars
Above
the
ground
floor
shops
is
light
open
space
designed
for
conventions
and
exhibitions
There
are
several
restaurants
in
the
dockyard
as
well
as
places
to
sit
in
the
sunshine
and
have
picnic
In
summer
cruise
ships
dock
at
the
small
port
outside
the
main
harbor
wall
providing
good
picture
of
how
the
working
dockyard
must
have
looked
when
it
was
home
to
British
naval
vessels
North
and
East
from
Hamilton
To
travel
north
from
the
city
of
Hamilton
means
traversing
the
parishes
of
Pembroke
Devonshire
Smithâs
and
Hamilton
(the
latter
not
to
be
confused
with
the
city
of
the
same
name!)
then
on
to
St
Georgeâs
Parish
at
Bermudaâs
northernmost
tip
The
North
Shore
Road
provides
views
of
the
rocky
coastline
On
the
verdant
South
Shore
there
are
fine
period
houses
many
still
in
private
hands
Two
of
the
worldâs
finest
golf
courses
nestle
against
Harrington
Sound
large
caldera
now
filled
with
tidal
seawater
Finally
you
reach
the
birthplace
of
this
British
protectorate:
St
Georgeâs
town
that
still
reflects
its
17th-century
beginnings
Taking
Cavendish
Road
out
of
Hamilton
leads
to
Middle
Road
which
runs
through
the
widest
section
of
land
in
Bermuda
Although
they
are
never
more
than
mile
from
the
sea
the
people
who
live
here
are
considered
country
dwellers
by
those
who
live
on
the
coast
You
will
come
first
to
the
Arboretum
(bus
route
#3)
hectares
(22
acres)
of
lawns
and
woods
filled
with
native
trees
Separate
swathes
of
land
concentrate
on
collections
of
ficus
and
palms
with
an
area
of
general
woodland
beyond
Itâs
great
place
for
children
to
run
wild
or
explore
in
the
undergrowth
Less
than
mile
past
the
Arboretum
you
will
find
two
churches
on
the
right
side
of
the
road
backed
by
hundreds
of
white
painted
family
tombs
on
the
hillside
The
larger
building
first
catches
the
eye
but
it
is
the
smaller
whitewashed
Old
Devonshire
Church
that
holds
the
interest
The
church
originally
erected
here
in
1716
was
totally
destroyed
by
mysterious
explosion
on
Easter
Sunday
31
March
1970
The
building
on
the
site
today
is
an
exact
replica
of
the
original
and
was
built
with
money
collected
by
public
donation
The
very
simple
interior
provides
the
perfect
environment
for
quiet
reflection
and
prayer
Middle
Road
eventually
reaches
the
village
of
Flatts
at
the
edge
of
Harrington
Sound
The
sound
some
3âkm
(2
miles)
in
diameter
is
thought
to
be
huge
caldera
that
formed
after
powerful
volcanic
eruption
Some
areas
of
this
inland
sea
are
immensely
deep
attracting
marine
creatures
to
the
safe
waters
Boats
also
take
advantage
of
the
protective
shield
and
in
summer
(AprilâOctober)
diving
and
snorkeling
are
popular
pastimes
narrow
bridge
fords
the
gap
between
the
sound
and
the
open
sea
through
Flatts
Inlet
The
tidal
waters
are
constantly
flowing
in
and
out
through
the
9-m
(30-ft)
opening
number
of
boats
rest
on
the
waters
of
Flatts
Inlet
which
is
one
of
the
most
photogenic
spots
on
the
island
The
waters
have
translucent
turquoise
hue
that
appears
almost
artificial
and
the
swaying
palms
create
truly
tropical
scene
On
the
far
side
of
the
bridge
that
spans
the
entrance
to
Harrington
Sound
is
the
Bermuda
Aquarium
Natural
History
Museum
and
Zoo
(bus
routes
#3
#10
and
#11)
The
facilities
were
established
in
1926
to
educate
visitors
and
native
Bermudians
about
life
under
the
seas
that
surround
them
Over
100
species
of
sea
creatures
live
in
tanks
including
one
145,000-gallon
tank
whose
water
is
regularly
replaced
by
seawater
from
Harrington
Sound
Healthy
coral
reefs
here
support
small
ecosystem
The
Natural
History
Museum
has
number
of
dioramas
depicting
the
geological
formation
of
the
Bermudian
islands
and
reefs
starting
some
100
million
years
ago
It
explains
how
the
many
cave
systems
were
formed
and
how
the
hundreds
of
unique
species
of
flora
and
fauna
developed
on
this
isolated
piece
of
rock
The
zoo
is
small
but
extremely
varied
for
such
small
island
Important
conservation
work
is
being
undertaken
The
staff
is
working
on
program
to
increase
the
numbers
of
flamingos
in
the
US
Virgin
Islands
and
you
will
find
small

Front
Street
in
Hamilton
The
14
km
(22
miles)
of
track
had
44
stations
along
its
route
but
the
service
ran
for
only
16
yearsÂ âÂ from
1931
until
1947Â âÂ before
it
accumulated
such
heavy
losses
that
all
the
rolling
stock
and
tracks
were
sold
to
what
was
then
British
Guiana
The
path
of
the
railway
line
can
clearly
be
seen
in
many
parts
of
Bermuda
and
is
now
valuable
natural
resource
enjoyed
safely
by
walkers

is
the
northern
section
of
Hamilton
Parish
which
youâll
find
just
before
reaching
the
Causeway
that
crosses
Castle

If
traveling
by
bus
get
off
at
the
Swizzle
Inn
famed
across
the
island
for
its
âRum
Swizzleâ
drinks
(made
from
secret
recipe);
itâs
also
great
place
for
lunch
Only
short
walk
west
from
the
Inn
you
will
find
the
Bermuda
Perfumery
and
Gardens
This
small
family
business
was
established
in
1929
by
Madeleine
and
Herbert
Scott
in
garden
shed
They
moved
to
their
present
site
in
1939
and
proceeded
to
plant
the
acres
of
flowers
that
serve
as
raw
materials
to
produce
their
small
range
of
signature
fragrances
The
business
has
now
been
passed
on
to
their
son
You
can
take
free
tour
of
the
âfactory,â
housed
in
200-year-old
farmhouse
where
you
can
watch
the
process
of
perfume
production
including
the
techniques
for
collecting
the
ripe
blooms
Then
take
your
time
and
wander
among
the
fragrant
gardens
with
their
swathes
of
jasmine
frangipani
and

perfumery
head
back
toward
the
Swizzle
Inn
and
turn
right
at
Wilkinson
Avenue
(by
Baileyâs
Ice
Cream
Parlour)
From
here
it
is
only
five-minute
walk
to
Crystal
Caves
The
unique
geological
conditions
that
formed
Bermuda
created
number
of
cave
systems
Experts
claim
that
there
are
many
yet
to
be
explored
and
charted
and
perhaps
the
Crystal
Cave
system
might
itself
have
been
left
undiscovered
were
it
not
for
quirk
of
fate
In
1907
two
young
boys
were
playing
cricket
and
after
particularly
good
stroke
they
lost
the
ball
down
small
sinkhole
They
decided
to
try
to
retrieve
the
ball
and
with
ropes
and
lanterns
they
entered
the
hole
and
discovered
magical
landscape
37
(120
ft)
underground
They
never
did
find
their
cricket
ball
but
when
you
enter
the
caves
you
will
understand
why
they
became
distracted
from
their
original
purpose
The
caves
have
cathedral-like
dimensions
with
hundreds
of
stalactites
and
stalagmites
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
old
The
stalactites
grow
at
rate
of
cm
(about
half
inch)
every
100
years
so
it
is
easy
to
begin
to
estimate
the
age
of
the
largest
structures
clear
tidal
lake
sits
at
the
bottom
of
the
cave
spanned
by
pontoon
bridge
so
you
can
explore
the
interior
Strategic
lighting
shows
the
formations
to
their
best

Continue
your
journey
to
the
east
on
South
Road
and
make
left
turn
at
Collectorâs
Hill
which
is
just
before
church
Travel
up
the
road
to
reach
Verdmont
Museum
historic
house
on
top
of
the
hill
(There
is
no
sign
for
the
house
from
the
main
road.)
Built
on
20
hectares
(50
acres)
of
land
Verdmont
is
believed
to
date
from
about
1710
Unusually
it
is
much
more
classically
Georgian
than
Bermudian
in
style
It
was
constructed
for
Thomas
Smith
prominent
ship
owner
and
several
generations
of
his
family
lived
here
It
has
fine
twelve-windowed
faÃ§adeÂ âÂ all
still
originalÂ âÂ and
three
stories
with
four
rooms
on
each
of
the
first
two
floors
The
structure
has
remained
practically
unchanged
and
was
private
home
until
1951;
its
owners
never
added
the
modern
conveniences
of
electricity
and
plumbing
Today
it
is
brimming
with
fine
period
furnishings
although
only
the
portraits
are
original
to
the
house
The
wooden
paneling
floors
and
staircase
add
an
elegant
air
to
the
structure
Now
owned
by
the
Bermuda
National
Trust
Verdmont
is
surrounded
by
walled
garden
filled
with
herbs
and
fruit
orchards
along
with
swathe
of
replanted
forest
of
cedar
and
palmetto
palms
Farther
along
South
Road
moves
closer
to
the
coast
and
Spittal
Pond
Nature
Reserve
soon
appears
to
the
right
Its
14
hectares
(34
acres)
comprise
Bermudaâs
largest
wildlife
sanctuary
home
for
migratory
and
native
bird
species
alike
Two
ponds
provide
marshy
wetland
complemented
by
coastal
cliff
environment
beloved
by
terns
and
visiting
longtails
Owls
and
the
obligatory
kiskadee
inhabit
the
woodlands
Spittal
Pond
is
well
known
for
providing
rest
and
recuperation
for
birds
blown
off
course
on
long
migratory
routes:
it
is
possible
to
spot
unusual
species
that
have
drifted
off
their
normal
routes
Well-worn
walking
trails
at
the
park
are
easy
to
follow
but
be
aware
that
there
are
two
car
parks
at
the
sanctuary
(east
and
west)
Donât
forget
which
one
you
parked
in!
The
main
road
leads
east
along
the
coast
to
John
Smithâs
Bay
small
but
much-photographed
beach
for
swimming
and
snorkeling
Just
beyond
the
bay
there
is
left
turn
leading
to
Devilâs
Hole
Aquarium
at
the
very
southern
tip
of
Harrington
Sound
One
of
the
oldest
tourist
attractions
in
Bermuda
it
has
been
welcoming
visitors
since
1834
The
hole
is
in
fact
collapsed
cave
producing
natural
seawater
aquarium
that
has
become
home
to
number
of
voracious
fish
sharks
and
turtles
waiting
at
the
surface
to
be
fed
The
fish
(usually
large
tarpon)
seem
to
enjoy
the
regular
food
service
offered
by
visitors
Incidentally
the
name
âDevilâs
Holeâ
derives
from
the
sound
of
the
seawater
entering
and
leaving
the
hole
rather
than
from
the
fearsome
reputation
of
some
of
its
inhabitants
From
Devilâs
Hole
Aquarium
it
is
possible
to
take
the
road
left
to
the
village
of
Flatts
and
the
North
Shore
Road
However
you
can
go
back
to
South
Road
in
the
direction
of
Tuckerâs
Town
and
two
important
golf
courses
Tuckerâs
Town
is
not
town
but
rather
collection
of
exclusive
communities
and
large
high-class
resorts
set
in
rolling
hills
and
small
sheltered
coastal
bays
Mid
Ocean
Golf
Course
and
Castle
Harbour
Golf
Course
straddle
the
roads
here
their
verdant
greens
and
fairways
tumbling
across
the
undulating
land
separated
by
small
casuarina
copses
(Be
mindful
of
the
state
of
play
as
you
pass
across
the
fairways
here:
there
is
danger
from
flying
or
wayward
balls!)
The
Mid
Ocean
Club
is
still
private
membersâ
club
with
long
pedigree
It
has
played
host
to
many
important
political
summits
since
the
end
of
World
War
II
including
the
âBig
Threeâ
Conference
in
1953
attended
by
Winston
Churchill
Dwight
D
Eisenhower
and
Joseph
Laniel
the
French
prime

Town
Bay
small
jetty
and
inlet
with
yachts
bobbing
gently
in
the
water
To
get
across
Castle
Harbour
to
St

you
must
go
north
here
taking
Paynterâs
Road
to
Harrington
Sound
Then
drive
up
along
Harrington
Sound
Road
to
reach
the
Causeway
to
St
Georgeâs
On
your
way
up
Harrington
Sound
Road
you
will
come
to
Lemington
Caves
series
of
caves
smaller
than
Crystal
Caves
but
equally
spectacular
Watch
also
for
Walsingham
Lane
and
sign
to
Tom
Mooreâs
Tavern
named
after
the
Irish
poet
who
spent
some
time
on
Bermuda
The
tavern
(which
is
in
fact
restaurant
with
French
and
local
cuisine)
is
open
only
in
the
evening
In
the
daytime
you
can
visit
Idwal
Hughes
Nature
Reserve
also
along
Walsingham
LaneÂ âÂ a
pristine
area
of
natural
habitat
Collapsed
limestone
caves
and
tidal

mangrove
swamps
provide
perfect
home
for
herons
tropical
frogs
and
many
species
of
fish
East
End:
St
Georgeâs
and
St
Davidâs
Islands
To
reach
the
remaining
portions
of
Bermuda
including
the
airport
and
St
Georgeâs
town
you
must
take
the
narrow
Causeway
across
Castle
Harbour
The
concrete
Causeway
was
built
as
temporary
substitute
for
the
bridge
lost
after
hurricane
in
the
early
part
of
the
20th
century
but
it
has
never
been
replaced
If
you
travel
by
motorcycle
on
windy
day
be
sure
to
take
extra
care
as
the
gusts
can
be
quite
strong
There
is
small
swing-bridge
at
the
far
end
that
can
be
slippery
when
wet;
however
the
middle
lanes
have
been
created
specially
for
the
passage
of
mopeds
and
bicycles
Once
over
the
Causeway
you
are
on
St
Davidâs
Island
Youâll
see
the
airport
terminal
immediately
ahead
The
road
travels
between
the
airport
and

leads
left
to
St

and
right
to
St
Davidâs
St
Davidâs
Island
Now
larger
in
area
than
St
Georgeâs
Island
St
Davidâs
Island
was
one
of
the
most
isolated
of
the
populated
islands
that
make
up
Bermuda
until
1940
when
the
British
government
leased
the
area
to
the
US
military
The
island
was
needed
as
military
base
but
was
too
small
for
that
purpose
so
extra
land
was
reclaimed
from
the
sea
to
create
land
area
big
enough
for
an
air
base
and
naval
station
Much
of
St
Davidâs
subsequently
became
small
piece
of
the
US
on
British
soil
Activity
has
slowly
been
wound
down
in
recent
years
and
US
service
personnel
are
not
as
numerous
as
during
the
post-World
War
II
years
To
reach
St
Davidâs
town
travel
along
St
Davidâs
Road
from
the
traffic
circle
on
the
far
side
of
the
airport
(Bus
route
#6
travels
to
St
Davidâs
from
St
Georgeâs.)
The
native
population
of
St
Davidâs
has
always
been
noted
for
its
fishing
skills
The
original
town
grew
up
around
the
British
military
batteries
built
to
protect
the
southern
entrance
to
St
Georgeâs
Harbour
The
town
is
still
in
the
protection
business
but
today
it
looks
out
for
the
shipping
that
passes
through
the
waters
around
Bermuda
St
Davidâs
Lighthouse
stands
on
the
highest
point
on
the
eastern
tip
of
the
island
and
sends
its
beam
32
km
(20
miles)
over
the
ocean
The
structure
took
three
years
to
build
and
the
light
was
activated
on
November
1879
It
also
acts
as
the
finishing
line
for
such
major
yacht
races
as
the
Newport-Bermuda
Groups
of
humpbacked
whales
that
pass
through
Bermuda
waters
in
April
and
May
can
clearly
be
seen
from
this
vantage
point
Off
the
coast
to
the
south
of
St
Davidâs
Island
is
smaller
Nonsuch
Island
once
quarantine
station
for
sufferers
of
yellow
fever
In
1961
small
colony
of
Bermuda
petrels
was
discovered
to
be
nesting
on
Nonsuch
and
it
has
remained
sanctuary
for
the
birds
since
that
time

Back
at
the
airport
cross
the
bridge
and
turn
left
to
get
to
Ferry
Point
an
important
strategic
area
of
land
at
the
western
tip
of
St
Georgeâs
Island
There
are
no
less
than
three
separate
fortifications
here
protecting
the
entrance
to
St
Georgeâs
Harbour
The
earliest
was
Burnt
Point
Fort
built
in
1688
to
help
stop
illegal
trading
by
local
sailors
The
Ferry
Island
Fort
on
small
island
short
distance
offshore
was
begun
in
the
1790s
and
was
almost
constantly
developed
for
the
next
80
years
In
1823
Major
Thomas
Blanchard
constructed
Martello
Tower
on
high
ground
behind
the
two
forts
where
soldiers
could
survey
the
surrounding
land
and
coastline
Today
the
remains
of
all
three
fortifications
comprise
Ferry
Point
Park
where
it
is
possible
to
explore
the
forts
at
your
leisure
walk
through
woodland
and
enjoy
the
beauties
of
Loverâs
Lake
It
is
wonderful
place
to
have
picnic
and
itâs
relatively
quiet
even
on
summer
weekend
Returning
to
Ferry
Point
junction
take
the
north
fork
to
St
Georgeâs
town
Youâll
travel
around
the
far
side
of
Mullet
BayÂ âÂ a
sheltered
natural
harbor
for
small
craftÂ âÂ and
then
past
childrenâs
play
area
before
reaching
the
outskirts
of
town
(St
Georgeâs
can
be
reached
via
bus
routes
#1
#3
#10
and
#11.)
Set
in
the
far
northeast
portion
of
Bermuda
St
Georgeâs
is
the
islandâs
oldest
town
and
the
historic
heartland
of
the
colony
Sir
George
Somers
and
his
brave
band
of
settlers
were
heading
for
Virginia
in
1609
when
they
were
shipwrecked
on
reefs
just
offshore
from
here
They
were
surprised
by
the
natural
riches
that
Bermuda
had
to
offer
as
the
island
had
good
cedar
wood
to
build
more
ships
Out
of
adversity
came
good
fortune
and
the
settlers
soon
built
two
new
ships
and
sailed
from
Bermuda
to
complete
their
original
goal
of
reaching
Jamestown
Somers
returned
to
Bermuda
the
following
year
but
died
here
before
he
could
develop
the
town
further
The
settlers
who
founded
the
town
in
1615
created
basic
grid
pattern
that
has
remained
unchanged
The
lanes
in
town
are
wide
enough
for
horse
and
carriage
but
no
wider
They
retain
their
original
names
some
with
reference
to
local
characters
and
activities
such
as
Printerâs
Alley
and
Aunt
Peggyâs
Lane
Main
streets
such
as
Queen
Street
and
Duke
of
York
Street
recall
the
monarchs
and
individuals
important
to
the
British
Crown
Take
time
to
wander
along
the
narrow
lanesÂ âÂ beyond
the
noise
of
contemporary
BermudaÂ âÂ where
you
can
imagine
yourself
back
in
the
16th
and
17th
centuries
The
town
is
small
so
it
is
difficult
to
lose
your
way
As
you
walk
you
will
find
many
historic
houses
and
museums
providing
many
more
clues
to
the
lives
of
these
fascinating
people
Start
at
Kingâs
Square
on
the
waterfront
Originally
known
as
âMarket
Square,â
it
was
the
center
of
all
activity
for
the
town
Here
you
will
find
the
Tourist
Information
office
whose
helpful
staff
will
be
able
to
supply
you
with
information
about
the
dayâs
activities
On
the
east
side
of
the
square
is
the
Town
Hall
which
dates
from
1782
Although
relatively
young
by
St
Georgeâs
standards
it
has
wonderful
cedar
wood
floors
and
ceilings
Here
you
can
find
out
about
the
previous
lord
mayors
and
view
commemorative
âCharles
and
Dianaâ
signature
harkening
back
to
happy
times
At
the
northwest
corner
of
the
square
is
the
Bermuda
Museum
of
the
National
Trust
This
17th-century
building
was
constructed
by
Governor
Samuel
Day
who
arrived
from
England
found
the
old
governorâs
house
in
disrepair
and
built
this
house
using
government
land
and
government
woodÂ âÂ yet
he
refused
to
hand
over
the
house
when
he
was
ousted
from
office
after
only
two
years
The
house
became
hotel
the
Globe
in
the
mid-19th
century
but
attracted
notoriety
again
in
the
early
1860s
when
it
became
the
office
of
Confederate
agent
during
the
US
Civil
War
In
1952
the
house
was
acquired
by
the
Bermuda
Historical
Monuments
Trust
and
was
opened
as
museum
in
1961
with
substantial
refurbishment
in
1996
On
the
ground
floor
pride
of
place
is
given
to
detailed
model
of
Somersâs
ship
Sea
Venture
Many
American
visitors
are
also
fascinated
by
replica
of
machine
commissioned
by
the
Congress
of
the
Confederate
States
that
stamped
seal
for
all
their
official
documents
There
is
also
short
video
presentation
called
âBermuda:
Centre
of
the
Atlantic,â
which
tells
the
story
of
the
founding
and
development
of
the
island
Climb
the
stairs
to
the
first
floor
where
the
so-called
Rogues
and
Runners
Museum
presents
detailed
exposition
of
Bermudaâs
role
in
the
American
Civil
War
Bermuda
had
many
ties
with
the
southern
states
through
both
business
and
family
bloodlines
Although
Britain
officially
remained
neutral
Bermudians
favored
the
South
wanting
to
help
their
friendsÂ âÂ and
make
lot
of
money
in
the
process
series
of
short
information
boards
brings
to
life
different
aspects
of
this
intriguing
time
in
Bermudaâs
history
Sadly
it
also
documents
the
true
story
of
the
blockade-runner
Fannie
which
returned
from
one
trip
in
June
1864
with
two
sick
crew
members
The
yellow
fever
they
carried
soon
spread
across
Bermuda
killing
many
hundreds
of
people
Graves
in
the
Royal
Naval
Cemetery
(near
the
dockyard
at
the
other
end
of
Bermuda)
offer
testimony
to
some
of
the
individuals
who
succumbed
to
this
dreadful
disease
In
Kingâs
Square
you
can
witness
re-enactments
of
many
of
its
historic
functions
The
town
crier
will
call
the
news
of
the
day
and
wrongdoers
will
be
punished
in
the
stocks
that
sit
outside
the
Bank
of
Butterfield
building
Nearby
on
the
waterâs
edge
is
dunking
stool
used
in
times
past
for
nagging
wives
or
busybodies
Today
local
ladies
dressed
in
costume
brave
the
waters
to
the
delight
of
visitors
small
bridge
leads
to
Ordnance
Island
tiny
island
only
(30
ft)
offshore
used
today
as
cruise
dock
in
summer
months
Named
for
the
guns
once
kept
there
it
was
used
also
to
hang
condemned
prisoners
Today
it
has
two
important
monuments
dating
back
to
the
birth
of
the
British
colony
of
Bermuda
On
the
left
is
full-size
replica
of
the
ship
Deliverance
one
of
two
vessels
that
Sir
George
Somers
and
his
group
of
settlers
rebuilt
following
the
shipwreck
of
the
Sea
Venture
in
1609
The
tiny
interior
is
not
for
the
claustrophobic
and
gives
good
idea
of
how
difficult
the
journey
must
have
been
as
the
passengers
huddled
together
in
minuscule
poorly
ventilated
space
with
only
rudimentary
sanitation
To
the
right
of
the
bridge
to
Ordnance
Island
is
sculpture
of
Somers
by
leading
Bermudian
artist
Desmond
Fountain
It
depicts
wind-
and
sea-swept
Sir
George
in
dramaticÂ âÂ perhaps
anguishedÂ âÂ pose
with
arms
outstretched
In
the
town
around
Kingâs
Square
are
delightful
number
of
attractions
that
tell
the
story
of
St
Georgeâs
from
the
early
17th-century
settlement
to
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
modern
times
To
the
left
of
Town
Hall
is
walkway
leading
to
King
Street
(a
cobbled
road)
and
two
important
historical
buildings
The
first
is
Bridge
House
an
L-shaped
building
on
the
left
side
This
is
the
oldest
inhabited
structure
on
the
island
(dating
from
about
1700)
and
is
still
in
remarkably
good
condition
considering
the
volatile
weather
that
it
has
undoubtedly
had
to
contend
with
It
is
named
Bridge
House
because
it
sat
opposite
small

Many
of
the
earliest
Governors
of
Bermuda
lived
here
including
Alured
Popple
famed
for
his
statesmanly
handling
of
the
islandâs
affairs
and
the
reinforcing
of
her
defenses
At
the
top
of
King
Street
is
State
House
built
in
the
1620s
to
house
Bermudaâs
Assembly
Today
it
is
the
oldest
stone
building
on
the
island
The
plain
faÃ§ade
and
sturdy
walls
were
designed
to
withstand
hurricanes
and
the
worst
of
the
summer
humidity
It
was
used
continuously
until
1815
when
the
islandâs
capital
was
moved
from
St
Georgeâs
to
Hamilton
The
local
Masonic
lodge
negotiated
with
the
Assembly
to
use
the
building
with
rent
of
one
peppercorn
per
year
price
that
remains
in
force
to
this
day
The
âpeppercornâ
rent
is
handed
over
to
the
crown
in
one
of
the
most
ornate
ceremonial
occasions
of

for
Tucker
House
Museum
which
was
from
1775
the
home
of
Henry
Tucker
the
President
of
the
Governorâs
Council
The
Tuckers
were
one
of
the
most
influential
families
on
Bermuda

having
arrived
on
the
island
in
1616
In

the
US
where
he
became
the

Across
the
street
is
the
Carriage
Museum
Until
the
1940s
horses
and
carriages
were
the
only
modes
of
transportation
permitted
along
the
narrow
Bermuda
roads
and
almost
every
well-to-do
family
had
horse-drawn
vehicle
However
these
disappeared
almost
immediately
following
relaxation
of
the
strict
rules
that
had
kept
motor
vehicles
off
the
island
This
collection
of
beautiful
carriages
celebrates
those
âgone-but-not-forgottenâ
days
St
Peterâs
Church
sits
on
Duke
of
York
Street
now
the
main
route
through
the
town
Originally
built
in
1612
it
is
the
oldest
Anglican
church
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
still
regularly
used
for
services;
much
of
the
present
structure
dates
from
1713
The
beautiful
building
is
filled
with
Bermudian
cedar
for
the
roof
supports
and
the
pews
The
font
is
even
older
than
the
church
itself
and
was
brought
with
the
earliest
settlers
from
previous
church
in
England
Pride

printing
press
first
brought
from
England
by
Joseph
Stockdale
in
1783
and
used
to
produce
the
Bermuda
GazetteÂ âÂ first
issued
on
17
January
1784
The
building
where
the

was
originally
printed
is
the
Stockdale
House
on
the
corner
of
Printerâs
Alley
and
Needle
and
Thread
Alley
Stockdale
was
an
extremely
industrious
man
and
also
man
of
foresight
as
he
also
organized
and
ran
the
first
postal
service
on
the
island
Continue
along
Duke
of
Kent
Street
and
you
will
come
to
the
Unfinished
Church
an
elegant
edifice
originally
begun
in
the
1870s
when
St
Peterâs
Church
was
badly
damaged
by
storm
and
thought
to
be
beyond
repair
As
construction
proceeded
however
the
local
population
decided
that
they
would
rather
invest
their
money
in
repairing
the
old
church
and
work
on
the
unfinished
church
was
immediately
stopped
Had
the
church
been
completed
it
would
have
been
fitting
place
of
worship
Continue
to
the
right
of
the
Unfinished
Church
up
Government
Hill
Road
and
through
the
rolling
fairways
of
St
Georgeâs
Golf
Course
one
of
the
most
challenging
on
the
island
until
you
reach
the
coast
Here
you
will
find
Tobacco
Bay
small
stretch
of
sheltered
beach
popular
with
the
cruise
passengers
who
disembark
at
St
Georgeâs
and
want
to
spend
time
sunbathing
It
was
here
in
1775
that
100
barrels
of
gunpowder
mysteriously
disappeared
from
stores
in
Fort
St
Catherine
and
found
their
way
onto
boat
bound
for
the
use
of
the
American
revolutionaries
Drive
past
the
sheltered
inlet
of
Coot
Pond
to
reach
Fort
St
Catherine
itself
(Or
you
can
take
minibus
which
runs
from
Kingâs
Square
to
the
fort
every
15
minutes.)
The
setting
of
the
fortÂ âÂ on
rocky
promontory
with
sandy
beaches
on
both
flanksÂ âÂ is
spectacular
with
strong
walls
rising
on
all
sides
The
fort
was
begun
as
early
as
1614
but
has
been
upgraded
throughout
Bermudaâs
history
Major
renovations
took
place
in
1793
1820
and
1840
as
technology
improved
and
weaponry
developed
The
last
major
upgrade
was
completed
in
1878

entering
St

Harbour
Gates
Fort
first
appeared
on
maps
as
âDanverâs
Fortâ
in
1626
It
became
obsolete
in
the
19th
century
and
was
used
as
family
home
from
1870
until
1922
before
being
restored
by
the
government
The
site
once
used
to
stop
suspect
and
enemy
boats
from
entering
the
harbor
is
now
great
place
to
welcome
the
large
cruise
vessels
making
their
way
into
Bermuda
Town
Cut
is
only
few
hundred
feet
across;
ships
dwarf
the
surrounding
islands
and
appear
to
pass
through
with
only
inches
on
either
side
One
wonders
what
the
old
defenders
of
Gates
Fort
would
have
felt
about
these
huge
vessels
looming
upon
them
It
is
truly
exhilarating
sight
Brief
History
European
standards
the
Hungarians
are
relative
newcomers
They
have
lived
in
the
Carpathian
Basin
for
mere
1,100
yearsÂ âÂ but
during
that
time
theyâve
had
more
than
their
share
of
suffering
Early
Settlers
The
settlement
of
present-day
Hungary
goes
far
back
in
time
Less
than
64
km
(40
miles)
to
the
west
of
Budapest
human
traces
thought
to
be
half
million
years
old
have
been
excavated
and
are
now
on
display
at
the
Hungarian
National
Museum
The
ï¬rst
tribes
that
came
to
this
area
brought
skills
and
tools
which
improved
the
lot
of
the
hunter
made
farming
feasible
and
in
time
gave
rise
to
primitive
industries
Around
the
third
century
b.c.
Hungary
was
occupied
by
Celtic-Illyrian
tribe
known
as
Eraviscans
refugees
from
wars
in
Greece
They
established
tribal
centre
on
top
of
GellÃ©rt
Hill
and
continued
the
early
settlersâ
artistic
and
industrial
innovations
The
Roman
Empire
Hungary
remained
beyond
the
reach
of
western
Europe
until
the
first
century
a.d.
when
the
Roman
empireâs
legions
advanced
and
pushed
its
northeast
frontier
to
the
Danube
By
the
second
century
about
20,000
Roman
troops
were
deployed
along
the
river
between
Vienna
and
Budapest
To
command
and
coordinate
this
long
exposed
line
the
Romans
built
military
camp
called
Aquincum
which
became
the
home
of
some
6,000
soldiers
and
in
time
spawned
civilian
suburbs
that
housed
up
to
ten
times
that
number
In
a.d
106
Aquincum
was
made
the
capital
of
the
Roman
empireâs
province
of
Lower
Pannonia
and
its
amphitheatres
bathing
complexes
aqueducts
and
the
sheer
size
and
quality
of
the
remains
unearthed
in
present-day
Obuda
testify
to
its
former
importance
As
the
Roman
empire
began
to
crumble
however
Huns
and
Vandals
swarmed
over
the
river
and
during
the
early
fifth
century
Aquincum
fell
to
the
tribes
of
Attila
It
is
believed
that
the
town
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
was
named
after
Attilaâs
brother
(or
possibly
his
brother-in-law)
Buda
who
was
banished
there
When
Attila
died
in
453
the
Huns
were
overthrown
and
the
Avars
became
the
dominant
power
occupying
the
region
from
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
to
the
early
ninth
century
The
First
Hungarians
The
tribes
that
were
ultimately
to
settle
in
the
land
arrived
in
896
They
had
wandered
long
way
from
their
home
east
of
the
Ural
Mountains
and
fell
upon
the
land
with
such
ferocity
that
the
local
people
thought
they
too
were
Huns
(one
might
be
tempted
to
think
this
is
the
origin
of
the
English
Hungary)
But
they
were
actually
Magyars
(the
Hungarian
word
for
Hungarians);
their
language
was
strange
to
outsiders
The
tribeâs
name
for
itself
became
the
name
of
the
country
and
its
language
as
well
Related
tribes
who
had
earlier
travelled
northwest
while
the
Magyars
migrated
west
ended
up
in
Finland
Their
mutually
incomprehensible
tongues
are
classiï¬ed
together
in
the
linguistic
ï¬eld
as
Finno-Ugric
The
first
leader
of
the
Magyars
Prince
ArpÃ¡d
founded
dynasty
that
lasted
more
than
three
centuries
and
introduced
statehood
to
the
new
land
Prince
GÃ©za
his
great-grandson
embraced
Christianity
and
on
the
legendary
date
of
Christmas
Day
a.d
1000
GÃ©zaâs
son
Steven
(IstvÃ¡n)
later
St
Stephen
(Szent
IstvÃ¡n)
was
crowned
the
first
king
of
Hungary
in
the
city
of
Esztergom
situated
on
the
Danube
Bend
The
ï¬rst
record
of
Pest
meaning
âlime
furnaceâ
or
âovensâ
in
Slavic
comes
from
1061
landmark
of
the
nationâs
civilization
in
these
early
days
the
Golden
Bull
of
1222
was
sort
of
âMagyar
Cartaâ
spelling
out
the
rights
of
nobles
and
commoners
alike
But
the
rights
of
man
were
the
last
thing
on
the
minds
of
the
Mongols
who
overran
the
country
in
1241
and
again
in
1242
Whole
towns
and
villages
including
Buda
and
Pest
were
subjected
to
an
orgy
of
killing
and
destruction
The
Mongols
did
not
stay
however
nor
did
they
return
King
BÃ©la
IV
then
set
about
reviving
the
wrecked
nation
and
founded
the
town
of
Buda
wisely
building
it
within
fortified
walls
The
Angevin
Dynasty
The
ArpÃ¡d
dynasty
ended
in
1301;
the
French
House
of
Angevin
(Anjou)
in
the
shape
of
KÃ¡roly
(Charles)
RÃ³bert
claimed
the
crown
He
moved
the
court
to
VisegrÃ¡d
before
it
came
permanently
to
Budaâs
Castle
Hill
Two
more
foreign
kings
ruled
after
RÃ³bert
but
it
was
Hungarian
noble
JÃ¡nos
Hunyadi
who
was
to
become
the
national
saviour
in
the
mid-15th
century
The
Turks
had
been
threatening
the
country
for
some
time
but
Hunyadi
led
the
Hungarian
army
to
victory
against
them
at
NÃ¡ndorfehÃ©rvÃ¡r
(now
Belgrade)
in
1456
The
son
of
JÃ¡nos
Hunyadi
Korvin
MÃ¡tyÃ¡s
(Matthias
Corvinus)
ascended
the
throne
in
1458
and
for
the
next
32
years
the
country
enjoyed
golden
age
of
intellectual
and
civic
development
Under
this
enlightened
kingâs
rule
the
city
of
Buda
became
an
advanced
centre
of
Renaissance
culture
and
Pest
ï¬ourished
in
trade
and
industry
King
MÃ¡tyÃ¡sâ
Royal
Palace
was
the
talk
of
Europe
Hungarians
say
that
when
MÃ¡tyÃ¡s
died
so
did
justice
resulting
in
internal
strife
Despotic
noblemen
repressed
the
peasants
so
harshly
that
an
army
led
by
GyÃ¶rgy
DÃ³zsa
rose
in
rebellion
in
1514
but
the
insurrection
failed;
DÃ³zsa
was
roasted
alive
and
the
serfsâ
condition
continued
to
decline
Meanwhile
the
Turks
were
again
massing
for
war
This
time
there
was
no
Hunyadi
to
lead
the
weakened
nation
and
the
king
Lajos
(Louis)
II
and
much
of
his
army
were
killed
at
the
battle
of
MohÃ¡cs
(in
southern
Hungary)
in
1526
The
neighbouring
Austrian
Habsburg
rulers
fearful
that
Vienna
would
be
the
Ottoman
empireâs
next
conquest
proclaimed
themselves
rulers
of
Hungary
thus
creating
buffer
zone
between
themselves
and
the
Turks
Hungary
was
effectively
dismembered:
the
north
and
west
fell
to
the
Habsburgs;
Transylvania
became
so-called
independent
principality
under
Turkish
auspices;
and
central
Hungary
came
under
direct
Turkish
rule
The
Turks
ï¬nally
occupied
Buda
in
1541
and
stayed
there
for
almost
century
and
half
achieving
and
bequeathing
little
of
note
except
of
course
their
baths
By
the
late
17th
century
the
Christian
armies
of
the
West
were
fully
mobilized
against
the
Ottoman
inï¬dels
Long
devastating
sieges
were
laid
to
both
Buda
and
Pest
and
when
ï¬nally
liberated
in
1686
the
cities
once
again
lay
in
ruins
Under
the
Habsburgs
The
Hungarian
people
then
found
themselves
under
the
rule
of
the
Habsburgs
which
was
not
much
better
than
life
under
the
pashas
and
in
1703
Prince
Ferenc
RÃ¡kÃ³czi
led
an
eight-year
struggle
for
independence
Outnumbered
and
deserted
by
their
French
allies
the
Hungarians
ï¬nally
lost
the
war
in
1711
Peace
lasted
for
the
rest
of
the
century
and
the
country
made
great
economic
strides
as
province
of
the
Habsburg
empire
Factories
theatres
and
newspapers
were
opened
and
Pest
expanded
its
role
in
international
trade
while
Buda
regained
its
status
as
Hungaryâs
administrative
centre
But
prosperity
was
not
for
the
majority
The
rich
were
getting
richer
while
the
serfs
were
getting
poorer
and
the
Magyar
identity
was
being
repressed
by
the
influence
of
the
Germanic
Habsburgs
In
the
mid-19th
century
the
Hungarians
once
again
went
to
war
for
their
independence
The
rebellion
of
1848
was
led
by
group
of
young
intellectuals
including
the
25-year-old
radical
poet
SÃ¡ndor
Petoï¬
provisional
government
was
formed
headed
by
Lajos
Kossuth
but
it
was
short-lived
The
Emperor
Franz
Joseph
summoned
help
from
the
Czar
of
Russia
and
the
revolt
was
crushed
in
1849
All
was
not
totally
lost
however
In
1867
under
compromise
designed
to
curtail
home-rule
agitation
the
Austro-Hungarian
empire
was
established
and
Hungary
was
ï¬nally
granted
its
own
government
though
key
ministries
were
shared
with
the
Austrians
This
âDual
Monarchyâ
saw
out
the
19th
century
on
bright
note
with
splendid
boulevards
and
proud
buildings
erected
to
create
the
Pest
we
recognize
today
The
Chain
Bridge
became
the
ï¬rst
permanent
link
across
the
river
the
Pest
metro
and
the
Pest-Vienna
railway
opened
and
in
1873
the
towns
of
Pest
Buda
and
Obuda
merged
to
become
Budapest
Wars
and
Revolutions
In
1914
as
part
of
the
Austro-Hungarian
empire
Hungary
was
called
upon
to
enter
World
War
I
Their
involvement
in
the
war
cost
many
thousands
of
Hungarian
lives
and
the
countryâs
hardships
multiplied
In
October
1918
Hungaryâs
last
king
KÃ¡roly
IV
was
toppled
by
what
is
now
called
the
Bourgeois
Democratic
Revolution
The
revolutionaries
joined
with
the
newly-born
Hungarian
communist
movement
but
took
their
reform
demands
too
far
and
too
fast
and
only
succeeded
in
provoking
right-wing
backlash
led
by
Admiral
MiklÃ³s
Horthy
Meanwhile
the
aftermath
of
war
as
dictated
by
the
1920
Treaty
of
Trianon
was
to
cost
Hungary
very
dearly
About
two-thirds
of
the
country
including
the
traditional
homeland
of
Transylvania
was
handed
over
to
the
new
âSuccessor
StatesâÂ âÂ Romania
Yugoslavia
and
Czechoslovakia
Horthy
maintained
his
role
as
regent
in
the
grim
twenties
and
thirties
while
the
country
demoralized
and
impoverished
seethed
over
the
treaty
Hitlerâs
Germany
meanwhile
provided
investment
in
Hungarian
industry
and
market
for
Hungarian
farm
produce
and
earned
grudging
admiration
from
the
Hungarians
for
its
deï¬ance
of
the
World
War
allies
In
1940
Hungary
allowed
the
German
army
to
cross
its
territory
and
as
reward
they
temporarily
recovered
parts
of
its
former
lands
from
Romania
and
Yugoslavia
It
was
false
dawn
before
the
countryâs
blackest
hours
Thousands
of
Hungarians
died
supporting
the
Germans
on
the
Russian
Front
and
just
as
Horthy
thought
he
could
squirm
out
of
Hitlerâs
grasp
by
declaring
neutrality
in
1944
the
country
was
occupied
by
the
Germans
As
the
Soviet
army
moved
closer
to
Budapest
in
late
1944
and
the
bombing
of
the
city
became
more
intense
Horthy
played
his
last
card
by
declaring
an
armistice
The
Germans
responded
by
installing
in
power
Hungarian
fascist
group
called
the
Arrow
Cross
This
brutal
fanatical
regime
murdered
hundreds
of
Budapestis
and
ensured
further
destruction
of
the
city
by
ï¬ghting
the
Red
Army
to
the
death
By
the
time
the
Russians
ï¬nally
took
Budapest
three-quarters
of
its
buildings
were
demolished
and
the
Hungarian
death
toll
in
the
war
came
to
about
half
million
In
and
Out
of
the
Red
Post-war
Hungary
was
transformed
from
republic
(1946)
into
Peopleâs
Republic
(1949)
Life
under
the
Soviets
was
not
much
brighter
than
existence
under
the
Nazis
After
hopeful
democratic
beginning
with
free
elections
fear
and
turbulence
ensued
Stalinâs
man
MÃ¡tyÃ¡s
RÃ¡kosi
established
his
sinister
AVO
secret
police
to
ensure
compliance
with
party
doctrine
After
eight
years
of
often
brutal
repression
the
people
had
had
enough
and
on
23
October
1956
marched
on
Parliament
to
air
their
grievances
The
students
and
workers
were
met
with
police
bullets
The
protest
snowballed
into
popular
uprising
and
within
days
provisional
Hungarian
government
led
by
Imre
Nagy
had
withdrawn
from
the
Warsaw
Pact
Soviet
retribution
took
just
12
days
On
November
Red
Army
tanks
entered
Budapest
and
quickly
crushed
the
armed
resistance
The
West
watched
in
horror
as
Nagy
and
thousands
more
were
executed
Some
200,000
Hungarians
ï¬ed
the
country
The
Soviets
installed
JÃ¡nos
KÃ¡dÃ¡r
as
the
new
party
boss
Although
rule
began
in
repressive
fashion
gradually
by
the
mid-1960s
severe
ideological
doctrines
were
being
relaxed
Hungarians
embraced
form
of
consumerism;
they
were
allowed
to
take
holidays
in
the
West
(though
limited
to
once
every
three
or
four
years
and
not
to
every
Western
country)
and
the
âgoulash
economy,â
even
though
it
failed
to
meet
its
potential
was
held
up
as
model
in
the
Eastern
bloc
As
the
winds
of
perestroika
blew
in
from
Moscow
KÃ¡dÃ¡r
was
removed
from
power
in
1988
and
in
1989
the
formation
of
opposition
parties
was
legalized
Hungary
was
the
ï¬rst
country
to
draw
back
its
Iron
Curtain
dismantling
the
barbed
wire
along
its
Austrian
border
and
allowing
East
Germans
to
escape
to
the
West
In
1990
the
country
held
its
ï¬rst
free
elections
in
43
years
and
was
called
republic
again;
in
1991
it
became
an
associate
member
of
the
European
Community
In
1997
Hungary
was
offered
membership
in
the
NATO
The
transition
from
communism
to
capitalism
has
not
been
easy
as
all
the
former
Eastern
bloc
states
have
found
but
Hungary
at
least
has
significant
share
of
Western
investments
to
help
support
its
rather
fragile
economy
As
bridge
between
East
and
West
Europe
it
is
well
positioned
for
any
improvement
in
trade
between
the
two
geo-political
blocks
Its
hopes
for
the
future
are
full
membership
of
the
European
Union
and
two
things
rare
in
the
history
of
Hungary:
namely
peace
and
freedom
Brief
History
The
Canary
Islands
are
land
of
legends
The
ancient
Greeks
thought
of
them
as
the
Garden
of
Hesperides
Romans
called
this
archipelago
the
Fortunate
Islands
and
Homer
tells
us
that
blessed
ones
were
sent
to
the
Elysian
Fields
to
enjoy
eternal
happiness
in
land
where
winter
was
unknown
Could
this
have
been
the
Canaries?
The
author
Plutarch
wrote
of
fertile
lands
somewhere
off
the
coast
of
Africa
where
the
breezes
of
springtime
never
stop
His
source
was
the
Roman
leader
Sertorius
who
had
heard
of
the
lands
from
an
explorer
Many
writers
link
the
lost
continent
of
Atlantis
with
the
Canaries
According
to
Plato
this
rich
happy
land
lying
somewhere
to
the
west
of
Gibraltar
in
the
Atlantic
Ocean
was
destroyed
by
earthquakes
and
tidal
waves
nearly
12,000
years
ago
After
the
cataclysm
only
the
mountaintops
of
Atlantis
remained
above
the
sea
and
constituted
seven
islands
The
Canaries
perhaps?
From
Plato
to
Jules
Verne
the
possibilities
have
stirred
peopleâs
imagination
ranging
from
the
theories
of
learned
academics
to
the
ramblings
of
wild
eccentrics
By
now
the
truth
is
surely
lost
in
the
myths
and
mists
of
time
What
is
undeniable
however
is
the
magical
presence
that
these
seven
volcanic
sisters
possess
When
you
sight
Mount
Teide
on
distant
horizon
you
will
understand
the
profusion
of
legends
The
First
Inhabitants
Long
before
the
first
European
sailors
beached
in
the
Canaries
all
seven
islands
were
inhabited
The
original
Canarians
came
to
be
called
Guanches
meaning
in
the
native
tongue
âman.â
Strictly
speaking
this
name
applies
only
to
the
original
inhabitants
of
Tenerife
The
Guanches
are
thought
to
have
arrived
in
the
islands
around
the
1st
or
2nd
century
b.c.
probably
from
North
Africa
Ethnographers
link
them
with
the
Cro-Magnon
and
Proto-Mediterranean
race
They
were
tall
light-skinned
often
blue-eyed
and
blond-haired
You
can
see
their
remains
in
the
meticulous
collection
of
the
Museo
Canario
in
Las
Palmas
on
Gran
Canaria
Here
too
you
can
study
their
preoccupation
with
death
Like
the
ancient
Egyptians
they
carefully
embalmed
their
dead
presumably
for
ceremonial
passage
to
the
next
world
Cryptic
rock
carvings
have
been
found
that
may
explain
these
rituals
but
so
far
no
one
has
found
the
Canarian
version
of
the
Rosetta
Stone
with
which
to
decipher
them
Another
baffling
mystery
is
how
the
Guanches
arrived
on
the
islands
No
evidence
of
Guanche
boats
has
ever
been
discovered;
so
were
they
marooned
here
by
pirates
or
perhaps
exiled
by
their
own
people?
One
theory
is
that
they
may
have
floated
across
from
North
Africa
on
reed
craft
The
expeditions
of
Thor
Heyerdahl
do
lend
some
credence
to
this
idea
and
the
concept
is
explored
in
great
detail
at
the
Pyramids
of
GÃ¼Ã­mar
on
Tenerife
In
keeping
with
their
Berber
origins
the
Guanches
were
cave
dwellers
though
by
no
means
did
all
Guanches
live
in
the
rocks
and
many
of
the
original
caves
that
remain
today
(for
example
the
Cuevas
de
ValerÃ³n
on
Gran
Canaria)
were
probably
used
only
for
storage
Cave
dwelling
in
such
climate
is
logical
idea
being
cooler
in
summer
and
warmer
in
winter
than
more
conventional
accommodations
Even
today
there
are
many
cave
dwellings
in
the
islands
Guanche
legacy
that
you
will
see
at
the
market
place
and
in
traditional
eating
houses
is
gofio
finely-ground
toasted
flour
that
is
still
traditional
Canarian
staple
The
Guanche
language
also
lives
on
in
such
place
names
as
Tafira
and
Tamadaba
(on
Gran
Canaria)
Timanfaya
(on
Lanzarote)
Teide
(on
Tenerife)
and
Tenerife
itself
Conquistadors
The
first
foreign
visitors
to
the
Canaries
are
thought
to
have
been
Arab
sailors
who
landed
on
Gran
Canaria
some
2,000
years
ago
and
were
met
warmly
In
later
centuries
the
islandersâ
gracious
hospitality
was
to
cost
them
dearly
Europeans
did
not
arrive
until
the
14th
century
when
the
Genoese
sailor
Lanzarotto
Marcello
colonized
the
island
known
then
in
native
tongue
as
Tytheroygatra
and
subsequently
as
Lanzarote
Slave
traders
treasure
seekers
and
missionaries
all
followed
in
Lanzarottoâs
wake
but
it
was
not
until
1402
that
the
European
conquest
of
the
Canaries
began
in
earnest
At
its
helm
was
the
Norman
baron
Jean
de
BÃ©thencourt
under
service
to
Henry
III
king
of
Castile
After
the
baron
had
taken
Lanzarote
and
Fuerteventura
with
comparative
ease
his
ships
were
scattered
by
storms
off
Gran
Canaria
He
next
turned
to
El
Hierro
where
the
awestruck
islanders
welcomed
the
new
visitors
arriving
in
their
great
floating
vessels
as
gods
BÃ©thencourt
returned
the
hospitality
by
inviting
the
natives
aboard
his
ships
He
then
took
them
captive
and
sold
them
into
slavery
Around
this
time
the
Portuguese
who
had
also
been
colonizing
the
Atlantic
turned
their
attention
to
the
Canaries
Naval
skirmishes
ensued
between
the
two
powers
but
at
the
end
of
the
war
of
succession
between
Portugal
and
Castile
the
wide-ranging
Treaty
of
AlcaÃ§ovas
ended
Lisbonâs
claims
to
the
Fortunate
Islands
By
order
of
Ferdinand
and
Isabella
of
Castile
the
second
phase
of
the
conquest
was
set
in
motion
By
1483
Gran
Canaria
had
been
subdued
and
in
1488
Gomera
was
taken
La
Palma
held
out
until
1493
and
after
another
two
years
of
furious
fighting
the
biggest
prize
of
all
Tenerife
was
in
Spanish
hands
The
process
of
pacification
and
conversion
to
the
Christian
faith
had
taken
almost
century
of
bloody
guerilla
warfare
with
thousands
of
casualties
sustained
mainly
on
the
brave
but
ill-equipped
Guanche
side
The
World
Is
Round!
Just
as
the
conquest
of
the
Canaries
was
reaching
its
climax
Christopher
Columbus
(Cristobal
ColÃ³n
in
Spanish)
was
planning
his
historic
expedition
in
search
of
sea
route
to
the
East
Indies
Each
of
the
Canaries
boasts
some
connection
with
Columbus
who
came
to
the
islands
because
they
were
then
the
worldâs
most
westerly
charted
points
and
therefore
the
last
stopping
point
before
venturing
into
the
unknown
The
great
navigator
definitely
stopped
off
at
Gomera
and
Las
Palmas
on
his
voyage
of
1492
and
he
even
recorded
volcanic
eruption
while
passing
Tenerife
Not
surprisingly
his
crew
took
this
as
an
ill
omen
but
as
history
tells
us
once
past
El
Hierro
they
did
not
drop
off
the
edge
of
the
world
after
all
Columbusâs
routes
and
Canarian
connections
may
be
traced
at
the
atmospheric
Casa
de
ColÃ³n
in
Las
Palmas
(see

The
role
of
the
islands
as
bridge
between
the
Old
World
and
the
New
World
has
continued
through
the
centuries
Canarians
have
settled
in
Latin
America
in
large
numbers
usually
in
search
of
better
way
of
life
and
news
from
Venezuela
and
Cuba
is
treated
almost
as
local
item
in
the
Canary
Islands
newspapers
Canarian
bananas
provided
the
stock
for
those
of
the
Carribbean
and
in
spoken
accent
and
musical
rhythms
the
Canaries
lie
halfway
between
Spain
and
South
America
Wine
and
Warfare
The
Canariesâ
first
major
agricultural
enterprise
was
sugar
Sugar
cane
sprouted
easily
on
the
islands
and
during
the
first
half
of
the
16th
century
burgeoning
industry
developed
Boom
turned
to
bust
however
with
cheaper
sugar
production
from
Brazil
and
the
Antilles
and
the
industry
died
Still
trade
links
had
at
least
been
established
with
both
the
Old
and
the
New
World
and
wine
became
the
new
farming
venture
to
bolster
the
economy
Grapes
grown
in
the
volcanic
soil
produced
distinctive
full-bodied
malmsey
wine
(malvasÃ­a)
that
became
the
fashionable
drink
of
aristocratic
Europe
Shakespeare
and
Voltaire
among
others
were
lavish
in
their
praise
and
todayâs
island
visitors
can
still
sample
the
excellent
wine
in
bodegas
restaurants
or
even
from
the
supermercado
When
touring
the
islands
you
may
still
see
old
disused
wine
presses
(lagares)
on
hillsides
By
the
end
of
the
18th
century
the
Canaries
were
sufficiently
important
trading
point
to
attract
all
types
of
pirates
In
1797
Horatio
Nelson
attacked
Santa
Cruz
de
Tenerife
in
search
of
Spanish
treasure
ship
The
defenders
responded
vigorously
accounting
for
the
lives
of
226
British
sailors
and
the
removal
of
the
lower
part
of
Nelsonâs
saluting
arm
The
Santa
Cruzeros
clearly
had
no
hard
feelings
towards
Admiral
Nelson
however
Once
it
was
known
that
the
attack
had
been
repelled
gift
of
wine
was
sent
out
to
Nelson
(England
was
after
all
an
important
wine
market)
and
street
was
named
Calle
de
Horacio
Nelson
in
his
honor!
Free
Trade
By
the
early
18th
century
Canarians
had
become
fully
Spanish
in
both
outlook
and
loyalties
and
many
volunteers
joined
the
Peninsular
War
(Spaniards
call
it
the
War
of
Independence)
which
ended
in
1814
with
the
restoration
of
Ferdinand
VII
to
the
Spanish
throne
Economic
problems
arose
in
the
early
19th
century
and
the
wine
industry
started
to
fail
Luckily
another
single-crop
opportunity
presented
itself
in
the
form
of
cochineal
parasitic
insect
attracted
to
the
opuntia
variety
of
cactus
The
tiny
bodies
of
the
female
bugs
contain
dark-red
liquid
perfect
for
dyeing
and
for
50
years
or
so
millions
of
bugs
were
crushed
for
the
sake
of
the
Canarian
economic
good
The
Bug
Bubble
burst
with
the
rise
of
chemical
dyes
in
the
1870s
With
the
failure
of
yet
another
mono-culture
the
Spanish
government
felt
constrained
to
help
the
Canarian
economy
In
the
mid-19th
century
free
port
status
was
granted
by
royal
decree
to
one
port
in
each
of
the
islands
(two
in
Tenerife)
The
lowering
of
duties
and
trade
barriers
at
time
of
considerable
shipping
expansion
had
the
desired
effect
and
Santa
Cruz
de
Tenerife
and
Las
Palmas
soon
became
two
of
the
worldâs
busiest
ports
The
most
recent
major
crop
to
come
from
the
Canaries
is
bananas
The
variety
is
the
dwarf
banana
small
and
very
tasty
and
today
demand
actually
outstrips
production
in
some
areas
The
first
exports
were
made
in
the
1880s
and
the
banana
has
continued
to
be
mainstay
of
the
islandsâ
economy
Despite
some
recent
problems
and
concern
for
the
future
it
is
hoped
that
bananas
will
continue
to
be
an
important
Canarian
crop
alongside
their
other
staples;
tomatoes
and
potatoes
In
1912
Cabildos
(Island
Councils)
were
created
and
given
the
responsibility
for
the
social
political
and
economic
administration
of
each
island
and
co-ordination
with
the
Town
Halls
This
led
in
1927
to
the
islands
being
divided
into
two
provinces;
Santa
Cruz
de
Tenerife
with
the
islands
of
Tenerife

and
Fuerteventura
The
Spanish
Civil
War
The
plot
that
sparked
off
the
Spanish
Civil
War
was
hatched
in
the
Canary
Islands
In
1936
group
of
senior
officers
discontented
with
the
policies
of
the
Spanish
Republican
Government
met
in
secret
in
the
woods
of
La
Esperanza
on
Tenerife
They
had
come
to
meet
fellow
officer
Francisco
Franco
whom
the
government
had
banished
to
the
Canaries
for
subversive
plotting
From
the
Canaries
Franco
took
off
for
North
Africa
the
launching
pad
for
the
insurgent
right-wing
attack
Three
years
later
his
armies
had
triumphed
in
ruthless
struggle
that
cost
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Spanish
lives
The
Canaries
were
not
spared
the
horrors
of
the
war
(mass
Republican
executions
took
place
in
the
aptly
named
Barranco
del
Infierno
the
Gorge
of
Hell
on
Tenerife)
but
on
the
whole
the
islands
prospered
during
Francoâs
period
of
dictatorship
which
provided
for
added
protection
to
their
free-port
status
Tourism
The
massive
growth
of
tourism
in
the
islands
since
the
1960s
has
in
some
cases
literally
refaced
the
landscape
with
brand-new
resorts
such
as
Playa
de
las
AmÃ©ricas
on
Tenerife
and
Playa
del
InglÃ©s
on
Gran
Canaria
springing
up
like
Gold
Rush
boom
towns
However
such
developments
are
mostly
the
exception
and
whole
swathes
of
even
the
more
developed
islands
are
virtually
untouched
while
La
Palma
La
Gomera
and
El
Hierro
are
only
now
starting
to
provide
even
the
most
basic
tourist
facilities
The
infrastructure
and
transport
systems
both
within
and
between
the
islands
have
as
consequence
improved
drastically
In
1972
the
passing
of
the
RÃ©gimen
EconÃ³mico
Fiscal
(Economic
and
Tax
Regime)
allowed
for
different
methods
of
tax
collection
and
economic
management
than
that
of
the
rest
of
Spain
Three
years
later
after
the
death
of
Franco
constitutional
monarchy
was
restored
with
King
Juan
Carlos
at
its
head
However
the
subsequent
de-colonization
of
Spainâs
Western
Sahara
possession
resulted
in
movement
of
many
thousands
of
people
back
to
the
Canary
Islands
creating
social
and
logistical
problems
The
year
1978
saw
the
declaration
of
new
Spanish
Constitution
further
strengthening
the
new
democracy
and
preparing
the
ground
for
State
of
Autonomous
Regions
As
result
on
16
August
1982
the
Canary
Islands
were
given
autonomous
status
with
nearly
all
governmental
functions
transferred
from
Madrid
and
the
status
of
capital
being
shared
between
Santa
Cruz
de
Tenerife
and
Las
Palmas
de
Gran
Canaria
The
former
is
the
head
office
of
the
Canarian
Parliament
where
the
President
of
the
Canary
Islands
is
elected
and
half
the
departments
and
ministries
are
based;
and
the
latter
is
the
seat
of
the
presidency
of
the
government
and
the
home
of
the
superior
courts
and
the
remaining
departments
and
ministries
The
Canary
Islands
Parliament
has
60
members
distributed
equally
between
the
two
provinces;
with
Tenerife
La
Palma
La
Gomera
and
El
Hierro
having
15
8
and
respectively
and
Gran
Canaria
Lanzarote
and
Fuerteventura
having
15
and
respectively
Each
island
still
has
its
own
Cabildo
(Island
Council)
and
all
officials
are
elected
by
free
vote
every
four
years
The
full
incorporation
of
Spain
into
the
European
Economic
Community
in
1990
brought
the
end
of
the
duty-free
ports
status
but
saw
certain
special
allowances
for
the
Canary
Islands
with
respect
to
agriculture
fishing
and
taxes
Brief
History
The
southern
part
of
Spain
is
at
geographical
crossroads:
It
is
the
gateway
between
the
Mediterranean
and
the
Atlantic
and
the
crossing
point
between
Africa
and
Europe
The
strategic
importance
of
its
location
has
given
rise
to
long
and
turbulent
history
The
earliest
evidence
of
human
occupation
is
provided
by
the
Paleolithic
cave
paintings
some
25,000
years
old
in
the
Cueva
de
la
Pileta
Neolithic
peoples
arrived
on
the
scene
in
the
fourth
millennium
b.c.
leaving
behind
signs
of
early
attempts
at
agriculture
and
fragments
of
their
pottery
Tribes
of
Iberians
from
North
Africa
crossed
over
into
Spain
around
3000
b.c.
and
initiated
Spainâs
first
experiments
in
architecture;
Spainâs
oldest
structure
stands
near
Antequera
dolmen
burial
chamber
known
as
the
Cueva
de
Romeral
After
900
b.c.
wandering
bands
of
Celts
entered
the
peninsula
from
northern
Europe
and
brought
to
the
area
their
knowledge
of
bronze
and
iron
work
As
they
moved
farther
south
the
Celts
merged
with
the
Iberians
and
began
to
build
walled
villages
along
the
coast
Traders
and
Colonizers
About
the
same
time
this
was
taking
place
the
Phoenicians
were
already
venturing
across
the
Mediterranean
from
their
homeland
in
present-day
Lebanon
They
reached
Spain
by
about
1100
b.c.
founding
many
trading
settlements
in
the
land
they
called
Span
or
Spania
The
first
was
Gades
(modern
CÃ¡diz)
followed
by
Malaka
(now
MÃ¡laga)
and
Abdera
(Adra)
on
the
Costa
del
Sol
Contact
with
the
sophisticated
Phoenicians
introduced
the
Celt-Iberians
to
the
concept
of
currency
After
about
650
b.c.
Greek
traders
entered
the
competition
to
exploit
Spainâs
rich
mineral
deposits
and
fertile
land
Their
influence
was
short-lived
although
the
olive
and
the
grape
both
Greek
legacies
soon
became
important
well-tended
crops
The
Carthaginians
North
African
people
related
to
the
Phoenicians
subsequently
took
over
much
of
southern
Spain
beginning
with
CÃ¡diz
in
precisely
501
b.c
They
extended
their
influence
along
the
River
Guadalquivir
to
Sevilla
then
to
CÃ³rdoba
On
the
coast
they
founded
the
city
of
Carteya
overlooking
the
Bay
of
Algeciras
(240
b.c.)
Carthage
challenged
by
Rome
in
the
First
Punic
War
(264â241
b.c.)
lost
most
of
its
Spanish
possessions
to
Iberian
attacks
But
its
fortunes
changed
with
an
initial
victory
in
the
Second
Punic
War
(218â201
b.c.)
Emboldened
the
Carthaginian
general
Hannibal
decided
to
advance
on
Rome
He
led
one
of
historyâs
great
military
marches
from
Spain
into
Italy
crossing
the
Pyrenees
and
the
Alps
on
the
way
The
Romans
invaded
Spain
to
cut
off
Hannibalâs
supply
routeÂ âÂ and
stayed
there
for
some
600
years
Roman
Rule
It
took
the
Romans
two
centuries
to
subdue
the
Iberians
but
in
the
end
most
of
the
peninsula
was
incorporated
into
their
new
colony
of
Hispania
The
south
formed
part
of
the
province
of
Baetica
virtually
identical
to
todayâs
AndalucÃ­a
with
CÃ³rdoba
its
capital
The
Roman
presence
had
far-reaching
influence
on
the
country
road
network
was
constructed
(the
Via
Augusta
ran
the
length
of
the
south
coast
on
its
way
to
Rome)
and
bridges
aqueducts
villas
and
public
buildings
were
added
to
the
list
of
their
achievements
The
introduction
of
the
Latin
language
(from
which
modern
Spanish
developed)
Roman
law
(the
basis
of
Spainâs
legal
system)
and
eventually
Christianity
brought
about
stability
and
degree
of
unity
Eventually
the
Roman
Empire
began
to
crumble
The
Romans
withdrew
from
Spain
This
left
the
country
to
be
overrun
by
various
barbarian
tribes
especially
the
Vandals
The
Visigoths
who
for
some
300
years
controlled
much
of
southern
Spain
eventually
dominated
these
tribes
Ultimately
the
Visigothic
kingdom
proved
unstable
The
monarchy
was
elective
rather
than
hereditary
which
led
to
disputes
over
succession
to
the
crown;
and
in
one
of
these
the
disaffected
party
looked
to
North
Africa
for
an
ally
Moors
and
Christians
In
a.d
711
some
12,000
Berber
troops
landed
at
Gibraltar
beginning
period
of
Moorish
rule
that
was
not
broken
by
the
Christians
until
nearly
800
years
later
Following
their
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Guadalete
the
Moors
(the
name
given
to
the
Muslims
in
Spain)
carried
all
before
them
They
pushed
the
Visigoths
into
the
northern
mountains
and
within
ten
years
most
of
the
country
had
fallen
to
Islam
To
this
day
AlmuÃ±Ã©car
Tarifa
Algeciras
BenalmÃ¡dena
and
several
other
southern
towns
are
known
by
their
Arabic
names
So
is
AndalucÃ­a
for
that
matter
originally
the
Moorish
kingdom
of
Al
Andalus
The
Moors
chose
CÃ³rdoba
as
their
seat
of
government
and
from
the
8th
to
the
very
early
11th
centuries
it
ranked
as
one
of
the
great
cities
of
the
world
The
city
was
capital
of
the
independent
caliphate
of
CÃ³rdoba
founded
by
Abd-er-Rahman
III
in
929
Under
the
caliphs
southern
Spain
knew
prosperity
and
peace
for
the
Moors
were
relatively
tolerant
rulers
and
taxed
non-believers
rather
than
trying
to
convert
them
Intellectual
life
flourished
and
great
advances
were
made
in
science
and
medicine
With
the
introduction
of
sophisticated
irrigation
system
crops
such
as
rice
cotton
and
sugar
cane
were
cultivated
for
the
first
time
on
Spanish
soil
as
well
as
oranges
peaches
and
pomegranates
The
manufacture
of
paper
and
glass
was
another
Moorish
innovation
Skilled
engineers
and
architects
the
Moors
built
numerous
palaces
and
fortifications
As
superb
craftsmen
they
excelled
in
the
production
of
ceramics
and
tooled
leather
as
well
as
delicate
silverware
The
ensuing
fall
of
CÃ³rdoba
was
as
remarkable
as
its
rise
In
1009
the
caliphate
splintered
into
number
of
small
kingdoms
called
taifas
which
were
constantly
at
war
The
Christians
in
the
north
seeing
the
enemy
weakened
and
divided
captured
the
taifa
of
Toledo
Under
threat
of
attack
the
other
taifas
sought
help
from
the
Almoravids
fanatical
Berber
warriors
The
Berbers
marched
against
the
Christians
in
1086
and
went
on
to
reduce
Moorish
Spain
to
province
of
their
own
North
African
Empire
For
time
therefore
the
affairs
of
Muslim
Spain
were
administered
from
the
Almoravid
headquarters
in
Granada
until
they
lost
their
grip
on
the
peninsula
softened
by
their
life
of
ease
in
AndalucÃ­a
The
pattern
repeated
itself
century
later
when
the
Moors
invoked
the
aid
of
the
Almohads
in
1151
These
primitive
tribesmen
who
came
from
the
Atlas
Mountains
of
Morocco
soon
made
themselves
the
masters
of
southern
Spain
They
constructed
major
fortifications
such
as
Sevillaâs
AlcÃ¡zar
endowing
the
Moors
with
sufficient
strength
to
resist
the
Christian
forces
while
longer
The
fortunes
of
the
Moors
and
Christians
swayed
back
and
forth
until
1212
when
the
Christians
gained
their
first
decisive
victory
at
Las
Navas
de
Tolosa
in
northern
AndalucÃ­a
The
Christians
gradually
captured
and
annexed
the
former
bastions
of
Moorish
rule;
in
1236
CÃ³rdoba
fell
to
James
the
Conqueror
followed
by
Sevilla
in
1248
The
Moors
were
in
retreat
retrenching
along
the
coast
and
withdrawing
to
the
security
of
their
strongholds
in
Ronda
and
Granada
In
military
disarray
and
political
decline
Moorish
Spain
nevertheless
saw
another
two
centuries
of
brilliance
under
the
Nasrid
dynasty
founded
in
Granada
by
Mohammed
in
1232
Refugees
from
CÃ³rdoba
and
Sevilla
flooded
into
the
city
bringing
with
them
their
many
talents
and
skills
and
adding
to
the
cityâs
brilliance
The
magnificent
palace
of
the
Alhambra
provided
the
setting
for
luxurious
court
life
dedicated
to
the
pursuit
of
literature
music
and
the
arts
Yet
the
Moorish
fortresses
along
the
coast
soon
came
under
attack
Sancho
IV
took
Gibraltar
in
1310
but
the
Christians
later
relinquished
their
prize
and
the
Moors
held
on
to
it
until
1462
In
the
1480s
the
Christians
launched
new
offensive;
Ronda
capitulated
to
the
sovereigns
Ferdinand
and
Isabella
in
1485
followed
by
MÃ¡laga
in
1487
and
AlmerÃ­a
in
1488
And
all
Christendom
gave
thanks
when
Granada
was
finally
conquered
in
1492
The
Golden
Age
With
the
triumph
of
Christianity
the
country
was
united
under
the
Catholic
Monarchs
(Los
Reyes
CatÃ³licos)
title
conferred
by
Pope
Alexander
VI
on
Ferdinand
II
of
AragÃ³n
and
Isabella
of
Castile
Also
in
1492
Cristobal
ColÃ³n
(Christopher
Columbus)
discovered
the
New
World
in
the
name
of
the
Spanish
crown
Fanatical
in
their
religious
zeal
the
king
and
queen
expelled
all
Jews
who
refused
to
convert
to
Christianity
in
the
same
year
and
the
Moors
followed
in
1502
The
rulers
thus
reneged
on
the
promise
of
religious
freedom
they
had
given
when
Granada
surrendered
With
the
Jews
who
left
Spain
went
many
of
the
countryâs
bankers
and
merchants
and
with
the
Moors
good
number
of
its
agriculturists
and
laborers
The
converted
Jews
(conversos)
and
Moors
(Moriscos)
who
remained
in
Spain
were
viewed
with
suspicion
by
the
Inquisition
which
had
been
established
by
the
Catholic
Monarchs
to
stamp
out
heresy
Many
were
condemned
to
death
and
still
more
fled
the
country
to
escape
persecution
The
16th
century
was
glorious
for
Spain
with
the
conquest
of
the
New
World
bringing
much
prestige
and
wealth
In
1503
the
Casa
de
ContrataciÃ³n
in
Sevilla
was
awarded
monopoly
on
trade
with
Spainâs
territories
in
the
Americas
For
more
than
two
centuries
Sevilla
was
the
richest
city
in
Spain
By
comparison
the
coastal
settlements
languished
and
were
subject
to
frequent
raids
by
Barbary
pirates
Under
constant
threat
for
more
than
200
years
the
population
drifted
inland
taking
refuge
in
fortified
towns
and
villages
hidden
in
the
foothills
of
the
Sierras
As
Emperor
Charles
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
the
first
Habsburg
Spanish
king
turned
his
attention
to
events
in
Europe
Between
1521
and
1556
he
went
to
war
with
France
four
times
squandering
the
riches
of
the
Americas
on
endless
military
campaigns
Charles
also
had
weakness
for
such
costly
projects
as
his
vast
Renaissance
palace
on
the
grounds
of
the
Alhambra
which
he
commissioned
in
1526
Taxes
imposed
on
the
Moors
served
to
finance
the
building
works
which
eventually
had
to
be
abandoned
for
lack
of
funds
when
the
Moriscos
revolted
12
years
into
the
reign
of
Philip
II
(1556â1598)
The
king
dispatched
his
half-brother
Don
Juan
of
Austria
to
quell
the
rebellion
which
ended
in
1570
with
the
defeat
of
the
Moriscos
and
their
eventual
dispersal
In
1588
Philip
II
prepared
to
invade
England
only
to
be
repulsed
when
the
English
navy
destroyed
Spainâs
previously
invincible
Armada
The
defeat
marked
the
start
of
long
decline
Philipâs
military
forays
and
his
expensive
taste
left
Spain
encumbered
with
debts
Participation
in
the
Thirty
Yearsâ
War
under
Philip
III
led
to
further
financial
difficulties
and
to
another
debacle
in
1643
when
Spanish
troops
were
defeated
by
the
French
at
Rocroi
in
Flanders
never
to
regain
their
prestige
French
Ascendancy
Spainâs
internal
affairs
became
the
concern
of
the
other
great
powers
after
Charles
II
died
without
an
heir
The
Habsburg
Archduke
Charles
of
Austria
challenged
Franceâs
Philip
of
Bourbon
in
the
ensuing
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
Gibraltar
was
the
scene
of
some
fierce
fighting
in
1704
when
Great
Britain
captured
the
Rock
on
behalf
of
Austria
Under
the
terms
of
the
Treaty
of
Utrecht
which
also
confirmed
Philipâs
right
to
the
Spanish
throne
Spain
was
finally
forced
to
relinquish
its
claims
to
Gibraltar
in
1713
Nearly
hundred
years
later
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
Spanish
ships
fought
alongside
the
French
fleet
against
Lord
Nelson
at
Cape
Trafalgar
(see
page
46)
But
as
the
wars
continued
Napoleon
distrustful
of
his
ally
forced
the
Spanish
king
Ferdinand
VII
to
abdicate
in
1808
and
imposed
his
brother
Joseph
as
king
He
then
sent
thousands
of
troops
across
the
Pyrenees
to
subjugate
the
Spanish
who
promptly
revolted
Aided
by
British
troops
who
were
subsequently
commanded
by
the
Duke
of
Wellington
the
Spanish
drove
the
French
out
of
the
Iberian
Peninsula
At
Tarifa
the
enemy
was
defeated
literally
overnight
in
an
offensive
of
1811
What
the
world
now
knows
as
the
Peninsular
War
(1808â
1814)
is
in
fact
referred
to
in
Spain
as
the
War
of
Independence
During
this
troubled
period
Spainâs
first
short-lived
constitution
was
drafted
and
their
colonies
of
South
America
won
their
independence
Troubled
Times
Ferdinandâs
return
to
the
throne
in
1814
destroyed
any
hopes
left
for
constitutional
monarchy
while
tension
between
liberals
and
conservatives
led
to
century
of
conflict
marked
by
the
upheavals
of
the
three
Carlist
wars
and
the
abortive
First
Republic
which
was
proclaimed
in
1873
On
the
AndalucÃ­an
coast
the
19th
century
was
time
of
tentative
expansion
With
piracy
at
an
end
number
of
towns
and
villages
grew
up
along
the
shoreline
and
the
extension
of
the
railway
line
to
AlmerÃ­a
in
1899
promoted
the
early
development
of
the
eastern
region
Alfonso
XIII
just
16
years
old
assumed
the
crown
in
1902
Prosperity
and
stability
continued
to
elude
the
country
which
remained
neutral
during
World
War
I
Against
murky
background
of
violence
strikes
and
regional
strife
the
king
accepted
the
dictatorship
of
General
Miguel
Primo
de
Rivera
in
1923
Seven
years
later
the
opposition
of
radical
forces
toppled
Primo
de
Rivera
from
power
Alfonso
XIII
went
into
exile
following
anti-royalist
election
results
in
1931
and
another
republic
was
founded
Parliamentary
elections
in
1933
resulted
in
swing
to
the
right
and
public
opinion
became
polarized
When
the
left
came
out
on
top
in
the
elections
of
1936
the
situation
deteriorated
at
an
alarming
rate
It
came
as
no
surprise
when
six
months
later
General
Francisco
Franco
led
large
section
of
the
army
against
the
socialist
government
Support
for
the
Franco-led
nationalist
uprising
came
from
monarchists
conservatives
and
the
right-wing
Falangist
organization
as
well
as
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
while
liberals
socialists
Communists
and
anarchists
sided
with
the
government
The
bloodshed
lasted
no
less
than
three
years
and
cost
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives
General
Franco
emerged
as
the
leader
of
shattered
Spain
Many
Republicans
went
into
exile;
others
simply
disappeared
The
Republican
mayor
of
Mijas
caused
sensation
when
he
finally
surfaced
in
the
1960s
after
three
decades
in
hidingÂ âÂ in
his
own
home
Franco
kept
Spain
out
of
World
War
II
despite
Hitlerâs
entreaties
to
the
contrary
The
Spanish
nation
gradually
healed
its
wounds
though
conditions
in
the
country
were
difficult
and
life
was
far
from
easy
Changing
Fortunes
All
that
was
to
change
virtually
overnight
as
Spainâs
tourist
potential
began
to
be
exploited
in
the
1950s
Credit
was
made
available
for
the
development
of
hotel
complexes
and
apartment
blocks
and
former
fishing
villages
like
Torremolinos
and
Marbella
began
to
change
forever
Spainâs
admission
to
the
United
Nations
in
1955
followed
by
the
advent
of
jet
travel
and
package
holidays
in
the
1960s
subsequently
opened
up
the
coast
to
mass
tourism
With
the
death
of
General
Franco
in
1975
Spain
returned
to
democracy
In
accordance
with
Francoâs
wishes
the
monarchy
was
restored
in
the
person
of
King
Juan
Carlos
the
grandson
of
Alfonso
XIII
(see
page
20)
More
than
just
figurehead
the
king
helped
to
thwart
military
coup
in
1981
keeping
Spain
firmly
on
democratic
course
process
of
decentralization
was
started
with
more
powers
being
devolved
although
not
equally
to
17
semiautonomous
regions
As
consequence
on
28
February
1982
AndalucÃ­a
was
proclaimed
an
autonomous
state
Also
that
year
the
socialist
government
of
Felipe
GonzÃ¡lez
was
elected
and
committed
itself
to
Spainâs
successful
integration
into
the
European
Community
(EC)
now
known
as
the
European
Union
or
EU
As
precondition
of
admission
the
border
with
Gibraltar
was
reopened
in
February
1985
after
16-year
hiatus
and
Spain
was
finally
admitted
to
the
EC
in
1986
Despite
high
unemployment
figures
and
separatist
rumblings
the
countryâs
economy
has
remained
one
of
the
fastest
growing
in
Western
Europe
What
to
Do
ome
people
visit
Budapest
to
pursue
special
interest
and
happily
spend
their
holiday
in
thermal
pools
amidst
ancient
Roman
remains
For
the
less
single-minded
there
is
wide
range
of
activities;
from
high
culture
to
late-night
bars
and
from
sports
to
folk
dancing
Some
visitors
especially
those
who
have
been
here
before
may
want
to
experience
Budapest
as
native
by
visiting
one
of
the
smaller
steam
baths
used
by
the
locals
horse
riding
on
the
puszta
(plain)
or
bargaining
for
old
Soviet
memorabilia
at
the
ï¬ea-market
Shopping
Not
very
long
ago
fistful
of
dollars
would
have
given
you
the
freedom
of
most
Budapest
shopping
streets
The
end
of
communism
the
imposition
of
VAT
at
16
percent
and
the
effect
of
inï¬ation
have
however
brought
an
end
to
those
bargain-basement
days
As
ever
artisans
provide
the
bulk
of
the
best
buys
but
it
is
worth
bearing
in
mind
that
their
hand-produced
items
canât
compete
with
the
price
of
the
mass-produced
substitutes
from
the
Far
East
If
something
is
extremely
cheap
chances
are
that
itâs
clever
imitation
Where
to
Shop
The
former
âIntouristâ
shops
which
only
took
HUFand
had
virtual
monopoly
on
quality
souvenirs
have
been
consigned
to
the
same
scrap
heap
as
the

of
Stalin
You
can
now
buy
most
Western
goods
in
the
cityâs
department

at
any
number
of
specialist

and
on

stalls;
in

at
all
the
usual
retail
outlets
Prices
are
nearly
always

foray
should
start
on

What
to
Buy
Ceramics
The
two
leading
brands
are
Herend
which
is
made
in
the
town
of
the
same
name
near
Lake
Balaton
and
Zsolnay
made
in
the
south
of
Hungary
The
Herend
factory
has
been
turning
out
porcelain
for
the
tables
of
the
nobility
since
1826;
members
of
the
British
royal
family
from
Queen
Victoria
to
Charles
and
Diana
have
been
customers
As
everything
is
still
hand-ï¬nished
prices
are
understandably
high
You
donât
need
to
travel
all
the
way
to
Herend
to

ceramics
as

are
but
one
variation
Elixirs

BÃ©res
Csepp;
you
may
still
ï¬nd

Sports
For
relatively
small
nation
Hungary
has
enjoyed
much
Olympic
and
World
Championship
success
During
the
mid-1950s
its
football
team
was
one
of
the
ï¬nest
in
the
world
For
the
most
part
national
sport
was
for
the
favoured
few
and
pursued
to
promote
the
cause
of
communism
Despite
this
Hungary
still
offers
spectators
and
participants
busy
world
of
sports
There
may
be
no
sea
but
Lake
Balaton
does
offer
playground
for
watersportsâ
fans
Horse-riders
wonât
be
disappointed
either;
the
Hungarians
have
been
known
for
their
equestrian
prowess
ever
since
the
Magyars
swept
over
the
Great
Plain
Taking
Part
Billiards

âBilliards,â

Clubs
and
Bars
Hungaryâs
late-night
drinking
and
partying
scene
is
not
much
different
from
that
in
other
international
cities
The
âPubsâ
are
based
either
on
the
English
model
or
more
commonly
the
German
bierstube
There
is
also
variety
of
international
bars
Continental-style
cafÃ©s
and
authentic
Hungarian
bars
though
the
latter
are
not
very
apparent
in
the
main
tourist
areas
Look
for
the
sign
sÃ¶rÃ¶zo
if
you
are
beer
drinker
and
borozÃ³
if
you
prefer
wine
While
sÃ¶rÃ¶zo
is
often
similar
to
German
bierstube
however
borozÃ³
is
rarely
like
Parisian
wine
bar
(and
neither
serves
only
beer
or
wine)
Live
music
is
quite
common
with
jazz
suppressed
as
subversive
in
the
Stalinist
era
currently
enjoying
something
of
renaissance
in
Budapest
nightspots
Most
performances
are
blues
and
dixieland
and
audiences
are
generally
young
There
are
also
several
cabaret
clubs
presenting
ï¬oorshows
with
big-production
numbers
and
scantily-clad
dancers
For
visitors
who
prefer
the
excitement
of
the
casino
Hungary
has
23
gambling
establishments
The
place
to
be
seen
is
the
Hilton
Hotel
which
(in
common
with
most
Budapest
casinos)
offers
French
and
American
roulette
blackjack
poker
punto
banco
baccarat
and
to
clear
you
of
loose
change
and
give
you
bit
of
exercise
slot
machines
There
are
many
other
city
casinos:
the
Las
Vegas
in
the
Atrium
Hyatt;
the
Gresham
in
the
Gresham
Building
Roosevelt
tÃ©r;
the
SchÃ¶nbrun
casino
ship
by
the
Chain
Bridge;
the
Orfeum
in
the
Hotel
BÃ©ke;
the
VigadÃ³
on
VigadÃ³
utca;
and
the
VÃ¡rkert
on
the
Buda
embankment
at
the
southern
tip
of
Castle
Hill
The
latter
is
housed
in
beautiful
neo-Renaissance
building
by
MiklÃ³s
Ybl
designer
of
the
Opera
House
Casinos
generally
open
from
4:00
p.m
to
3:00
or
4:00
a.m
Films
Hungarians
take
their
movies
seriously
and
Hungarian
directors
have
come
up
with
lastingly
interesting
works
But
the
tourist
is
out
of
luck
because
the
domestic
product
is
incomprehensible
even
locally
and
most
of
the
foreign
films
are
dubbed
into
Hungarian
Folklore
Despite
recent
cultural
invasion
from
the
West
Hungary
still
has
very
active
folk-music
scene;
and
where
there
is
music
dancing
is
never
very
far
behind
Hungarian
folk-dancing
is
well
worth
watching
and
takes
you
through
the
whole
gamut
of
courtly
wedding
dances
to
high-energy
boot-slapping
âLadâs
Dancesâ
from
the
18th
century
As
ever
itâs
best
to
catch
it
at
local
festivals
where
performers
are
there
for
the
love
of
dancing
or
local
pride
as
opposed
to
the
tourist
dollar
In
the
same
vein
look
out
for
the
real
gypsy
dancers
who
have
vivacity
associated
with
the
likes
of
Andalucian
ï¬amenco
performers
You
can
see
Hungarian
dancersÂ âÂ amateur
or
professionalÂ âÂ most
nights
at
the
Municipal
Folklore
Centre
at
FehÃ©rvÃ¡ri
Ãºt
47
south
of
GellÃ©rt
Hill
Folklore
evenings
are
also
staged
at
other
venues;
the
Hungarian
State
Folk
Ensemble
gives
excellent
performances
Folklore
evenings
of
different
type
are
also
touted
by
some
restaurants
These
are
generally
staged
for
tour
groups
on
whistle-stop
visits
and
while
they
provide
an
easy
option
they
are
not
representative
of
real
Hungarian
folk
entertainment
Children
The
main
roads
of
Budapest
and
particularly
Pest
are
busy
with
people
and
trafï¬c
and
children
have
to
be
closely
watched
Many
other
areas
in
the
city
and
the
surrounding
region
however
are
much
more
suitable
for
them
The
obvious
place
to
go
is
the
City
Park
where
the
zoo
and
VidÃ¡m
Park
are
within
few
yards
of
each
other
and
the
circus
makes
regular
appearances
The
zoo
as
well
as
the
amusement
park
are
more
traditional
than
modern
but
the
circus
is
reputedly
one
of
Europeâs
best
If
the
weather
is
warm
the
splendid
SzÃ©chenyi
Baths
is
the
perfect
place
for
cooling
off
In
summer
thereâs
boating
lake
in
the
park
and
in
winter
this
converts
to
an
ice-skating
rink
The
other
oasis
in
the
city
is
Margaret
Island
You
can
spend
good
hour
or
so
riding
round
it
en
famille
on
bicycle-carriage
made

You
can
also
swim
here
in
the
cityâs
biggest

the
Palatinus
Strand
Children
also
seem
to
enjoy
the
open-air

pool
at
the
GellÃ©rt
Hotel
Out
of

Lake
Balaton
is
good
place
for
water
babies
particularly
the
southern
edge
where
the
sandy
shore
slopes
gently
into
warm
water
cog-wheel
railway
and
small-gauge
train
takes
you
to
the
peaceful
Buda
hills;
the
latter
is
staffed
almost
entirely
by
children
apart
from
the
driver
(see
page

The
chairlift
is
great
favourite
Itâs
good
idea
to
take
along
picnic
Older
children
with
an
interest
in

may
enjoy

Brief
History
During
the
last
fifty
years
great
deal
of
research
has
been
undertaken
to
discover
more
about
the
great
ancient
societies
of
the
YucatÃ¡n
Huge
sections
of
their
daily
lives
(and
particularly
why
they
came
to
abandon
their
cities)
are
still
shrouded
in
mystery
but
great
strides
have
been
made
in
deciphering
their
hieroglyphs
and
stelae
(inscribed
stone
pillars)
Despite
these
mysteries
there
are
few
places
in
the
world
where
the
past
feels
as
close
as
it
does
in
the
YucatÃ¡n
The
thatched
huts
that
appear
in
1,000-year-old
carvings
at
Uxmal
can
be
seen
today
in
every
roadside
village
The
stone
metates
or
grinding
dishes
which
grace
many
kitchen
in
town
or
village
are
identical
to
those
left
as
offerings
to
the
rain
gods
in
centuries
past
Away
from
the
cities
the
people
still
speak
the
Mayan
tongue
and
their
religious
beliefs
still
bear
the
imprint
of
the
ancient
rituals
of
their
ancestors
And
perhaps
most
striking
of
all
the
distinctive
hooked
nose
and
sloping
forehead
of
the
ancient
Maya
whose
stony
profiles
look
down
on
the
visitor
from
the
carved
walls
of
their
ruined
cities
are
still
reflected
in
the
features
of
the
local
people
The
Maya
These
peopleâs
ancestors
arrived
in
Central
America
many
thousands
of
years
ago
Small
bands
of
Asiatic
hunters
migrated
across
the
Bering
Strait
land
bridge
before
12,000
b.c
and
gradually
spread
southwards
through
the
Americas
During
the
Archaic
period
(after
5,200
b.c.)
these
people
settled
in
what
is
now
modern
Mexico
They
developed
primitive
agriculture
domesticating
cattle
and
cultivating
corn
beans
chili
peppers
and
squash
(a
pumpkin-like
vegetable)
in
burned
clearings
in
the
jungle
Over
time
society
developed
that
was
so
successful
they
could
devote
time
to
activities
other
than
simple
food
cultivation
These
people
known
as
the
Olmec
are
considered
to
be
the
first
Mesoamerican
culture
the
one
from
which
all
others
evolved
They
developed
calendar
based
on
52-year
cycle
They
also
constructed
pyramids
for
worship
By
1500
b.c
the
group
that
came
to
be
known
as
the
Maya
settled
in
an
area
which
stretched
from
the
Pacific
coast
to
the
southern
YucatÃ¡n
taking
in
modern-day
Guatemala
Belize
the
western
parts
of
El
Salvador
and
Honduras
and
the
Mexican
state
of
Campeche
In
the
succeeding
centuries
they
migrated
into
the
northern
YucatÃ¡nÂ âÂ what
are
now
the
modern
Mexican
states
of
YucatÃ¡n
Quintana
Roo
and
part
of
Tabasco
Though
their
antecedents
are
still
shadowy
they
were
much
influenced
by
the
Olmec
They
developed
and
refined
the
Olmec
calendar
and
counting
system
and
improved
their
building
practices
The
whole
YucatÃ¡n
peninsula
witnessed
the
flowering
of
classic
Mayan
civilization
and
society
of
great
sophistication;
with
its
magnificent
pyramids
temples
and
palaces
decorated
with
wall
paintings
and
carved
low-reliefs
written
language
of
hieroglyphics
and
complicated
medical
procedures
to
heal
the
injured
or
the
sick
Mayan
astronomers
tracked
the
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
predicting
eclipses
and
marking
the
times
for
the
planting
of
the
new
corn
In
fact
corn
came
to
symbolize
life
for
the
MayaÂ âÂ in
their
myths
of
creation
mankind
was
formed
from
lumps
of
maize
dough
Elaborate
rituals
grew
up
around
the
preparation
of
the
milpas
(cornfields)
and
the
planting
and
harvesting
of
the
crop
whose
success
depended
on
the
coming
of
the
annual
rains
These
rituals
were
undertaken
by
small
number
of
initiates
who
controlled
the
knowledge
of
the
Maya
Because
the
region
has
no
surface
rivers
rain
was
precious
resource
and
the
Maya
saw
any
stock
of
water
such
as
the
limestone
water
holes
or
cenotes
as
holy
places
The
rain
god
Chaac
was
very
important
deity
whose
image
can
be
seen
at
every
Mayan
site
But
there
was
dark
side
to
this
sophisticated
society
The
Maya
viewed
their
gods
not
as
benevolent
guides
but
as
changeable
spirits
in
need
of
constant
appeasement
To
incur
the
wrath
of
the
gods
would
result
in
drought
loss
of
crops
and
certain
starvation
To
keep
the
gods
happy
the
people
offered
sacrifices
at
their
great
pyramid
temples
The
ceremonies
were
overseen
by
powerful
caste
of
high
priests
Grain
and
animals
were
used
but
the
gods
came
to
demand
more
and
cult
of
human
sacrifice
grew
The
Maya
went
out
on
raiding
parties
taking
hostages
from
the
surrounding
lands
to
use
in
their
bloody
ceremonies
The
murals
and
reliefs
at
Mayan
cities
tell
gory
tales
of
beheading
and
the
tearing
out
of
human
hearts
to
appease
the
lords
of
the
underworld
Archaeologists
dredging
the
Sacred
Cenote
of
ChichÃ©n
ItzÃ¡
have
recovered
dozens
of
human
skeletons
thought
to
be
the
remains
of
victims
sacrificed
to
the
rain
god
Mayan
civilization
in
the
northern
YucatÃ¡n
reached
its
peak
around
a.d
900â1200
For
reasons
still
unknownÂ âÂ perhaps
civil
war
drought
or
diseaseÂ âÂ the
great
cities
were
abandoned
By
the
time
the
Spaniards
arrived
in
the
early
16th
century
the
jungle
was
reclaiming
the
pyramids;
the
richly
painted
murals
of
warriors
Mayan
lords
animals
and
gods
were
already
crumbling
and
dissolving
in
the
warm
rain
The
priest
caste
seemed
to
have
vanished
along
with
their
knowledge
The
only
people
the
Spanish
found
were
farmers
In
the
Wake
of
CortÃ©s
The
first
recorded
Europeans
to
arrive
in
the
YucatÃ¡n
in
1511
were
doubly
unfortunate:
group
of
Spanish
sailors
survived
shipwreck
on
the
coast
of
what
is
now
Quintana
Roo
only
to
be
sacrificed
by
the
Mayan
natives
However
two
were
allowed
to
live
as
slaves
and
one
Gonzalo
Guerrero
went
native
and
married
the
chiefâs
daughter
His
children
were
the
first
mestizosÂ âÂ the
people
of
mixed
Indian
and
Spanish
blood
who
now
make
up
55
percent
of
the
Mexican
population
In
1517
an
expedition
led
by
Francisco
Hernandez
de
CordobÃ¡
landed
on
the
west
coast
of
the
YucatÃ¡n
near
Campeche
but
were
beaten
back
by
hail
of
arrows
from
the
hostile
natives
However
the
following
year
ambitious
young
Captain
Juan
de
Grijalva
discovered
the
island
of
Cozumel
and
skirted
the
coast
of
the
peninsula
hearing
tales
from
the
Indians
of
the
great
civilization
of
the
Aztecs
Here
they
told
him
you
can
find
city
made
of
gold
Grijalvaâs
stories
focused
Spanish
attention
on
central
Mexico
and
in
1519
Hernan
CortÃ©s
landed
in
Veracruz
to
start
an
expedition
that
would
end
in
the
conquest
of
Moctezuma
and
the
Aztec
Empire
Though
he
had
begun
his
campaign
without
the
Kingâs
authority
once
news
of
the
treasures
captured
by
CortÃ©s
reached
Madrid
royal
warrant
was
dispatched
to
legitimize
the
victory
and
create
âNew
SpainâÂ âÂ the
latest
Spanish
colony
However
it
was
left
to
Don
Francisco
de
Montejo
âa
gentleman
of
Seville,â
following
in
the
great
conquistadorâs
wake
to
take
possession
of
the
YucatÃ¡n
in
the
name
of
the
Spanish
king
Arriving
on
the
coast
in
1527
Montejoâs
forces
were
hindered
by
the
dense
jungle
and
withering
climate
and
were
met
by
fierce
resistance
from
the
natives
To
make
matters
worse
news
of
great
riches
discovered
in
Peru
led
many
of
his
men
to
desert
in
search
of
greater
rewards
The
campaign
went
so
badly
that
by
1535
the
Spaniards
had
been
completely
driven
out
of
the
YucatÃ¡n
In
1537
another
force
under
the
command
of
Montejo
el
Mozo
(the
Younger)
Don
Franciscoâs
son
set
out
to
plant
the
Spanish
standard
on
Yucatecan
soil
At
first
ill
fortune
dogged
them;
the
dwindling
force
was
besieged
in
ChampotÃ³n
on
the
west
coast
for
two
miserable
years
With
reinforcements
the
Spaniards
managed
to
establish
beachhead
band
of
only
57
men
led
by
Montejo
el
Mozoâs
cousin
(yet
another
Don
Francisco)
marched
inland
to
take
the
Mayan
village
of
TâHo
The
Indians
gathered
their
forces
for
one
last
great
battle
and
thousands
of
them
fell
upon
the
Spanish
camp
now
defended
by
200
men
The
horses
and
superior
weaponry
of
the
Spaniards
gave
them
the
edge
and
they
slaughtered
hundreds
of
Indian
warriors
After
the
battle
local
chiefs
made
peace
with
the
invaders
and
on
January
1542
the
Montejos
founded
the
Spanish
city
of
MÃ©rida
on
the
site
The
Caste
War
Under
Spanish
rule
land
was
taken
from
the
Maya
and
turned
over
to
tobacco
and
sugarcane
plantations
and
the
once-proud
Indians
were
reduced
to
farm
laborers
Franciscan
friars
such
as
the
16th-century
Bishop
Diego
de
Landa
were
dispatched
from
Europe
to
spread
the
Christian
faith
throughout
the
peninsula
though
they
were
met
with
some
resistanceÂ âÂ any
similarity
between
the
early
Yucatecan
churches
and
military
fortresses
is
not
accidental
Eventually
the
Maya
accepted
the
new
faith
but
combined
it
with
elements
of
their
old
beliefs
Unfortunately
Landa
saw
it
as
sacred
duty
to
destroy
the
old
Mayan
ways
and
he
was
responsible
for
the
burning
of
many
chronicles
relating
to
their
beliefs
and
culture
In
1821
Mexico
declared
its
independence
from
Spain
Tension
had
been
simmering
for
decades
fostered
by
Spainâs
treatment
of
her
New
Spanish-born
colonists
or
criollos
(deemed
to
be
second-class
citizens
compared
to
those
born
in
the
homeland)
Her
trade
laws
decreed
that
everything
produced
in
New
Spain
must
first
cross
the
Atlantic
to
Spain
before
being
traded
with
third
country
so
that
the
proper
taxes
and
tariffs
could
be
collected
The
geography
of
the
northern
YucatÃ¡n
region
separated
it
physically
from
the
rest
of
New
Spain
and
fewer
colonial
landowners
settled
here
than
the
area
around
the
new
capital
(now
Mexico
City)
Furthermore
this
isolation
led
to
the
development
of
strong
independent
streak
for
both
colonists
and
indigenous
peoples
The
YucatÃ¡n
declared
its
independence
in
1821
but
did
not
join
the
fledgling
country
of
Mexico
until
1823
In
1840
it
changed
its
mind
and
withdrew
from
the
union
This
was
the
catalyst
for
the
oppressed
Maya
to
take
up
arms
against
their
colonial
oppressors
In
1847
savage
uprising
known
as
the
Caste
War
saw
Mayan
rebels
massacre
white
settlers
and
take
control
of
nearly
two-thirds
of
the
peninsula
By
1850
they
had
driven
the
Mexicans
back
to
their
strongholds
in
MÃ©rida
and
Campeche
However
in
an
amazing
turnaround
the
Mayaâs
ancient
beliefs
became
their
undoing
Just
when
the
Mexicans
were
on
the
point
of
surrender
the
rains
came
early
and
the
Indians
obedient
to
their
gods
dropped
their
weapons
and
returned
to
their
milpas
to
plant
the
sacred
corn
The
settlers
called
in
reinforcements
and
wreaked
terrible
revenge
on
the
natives
One
group
of
rebels
known
as
the
Chan
Santa
Cruz
held
out
in
the
jungles
of
Quintana
Roo
around
the
city
of
Tulum
harrying
the
Mexicans
and
making
the
east
coast
of
the
YucatÃ¡n
dangerous
area
off-limits
until
well
into
the
20th
century
The
Henequen
Boom
Life
was
difficult
in
northern
YucatÃ¡n
as
the
lack
of
surface
water
and
the
limestone
sub-surface
made
it
difficult
to
grow
commercial
crops
or
raise
cattle
However
in
the
late
19th
century
the
hacienda
or
plantation
owners
found
crop
that
grew
successfully
and
was
much
in
demand
around
the
worldÂ âÂ the
henequen
plant
The
fibers
produced
by
henequen
could
be
made
into
rope
and
twine
indispensable
for
sea-faring
and
international
trade
YucatÃ¡n
was
the
principal
producer
exporting
their
goods
through
the
port
of
Sisal
on
the
northern
coast
Processed
henequen
soon
became
known
around
the
world
as
sisal
The
money
earned
by
the
plantation
owners
was
spent
on
grand
mansions
along
MÃ©ridaâs
Paseo
de
Montejo;
they
were
filled
with
the
best
in
furniture
porcelain
and
artwork
The
Indians
however
worked
the
land
for
pittance
In
the
east
some
scraped
out
living
by
tapping
the
sap
of
the
zapote
or
chicle
tree
and
selling
it
to
American
manufacturers
of
chewing
gum
Unfortunately
when
the
henequen
bubble
burst
in
the
1930s
with
the
advent
of
synthetic
fibers
the
peninsula
fell
into
an
economic
decline
from
which
there
seemed
to
be
little
hope
of
respite
Meanwhile
under
the
presidency
of
Porfirio
Diaz
Quintana
Roo
on
the
YucatÃ¡n
peninsulaâs
eastern
coast
Â named
after
Andreas
Quintana
Roo
writer
and
independence
movement
leader
between
1810
and
1821Â â
was
declared
territory
of
Mexico
in
1902
Government
troops
clamped
down
on
rebellious
Indians
who
continued
to
resist
until
peace
treaty
was
finally
negotiated
in
1935
The
overthrow
of
Porfirio
Diaz
in
1917
led
to
reform
and
new
constitution
including
bill
of
rights
for
Mexican
workers
Many
haciendas
were
broken
up
and
returned
to
the
people
But
the
YucatÃ¡n
remained
backwater
largely
forgotten
and
ignored
No
overland
route
existed
from
MÃ©rida
to
the
rest
of
Mexico
until
1949
when
the
first
railway
arrived
Before
then
all
commercial
travel
to
and
from
the
peninsula
was
by
sea
and
it
was
faster
and
easier
to
travel
to
Cuba
or
the
US
than
to
Mexico
City
Mexicoâs
Mega-Resort
Despite
its
considerable
oil
reserves
and
mineral
wealth
debt
booming
population
growth
and
grinding
poverty
have
crippled
the
economy
of
modern
Mexico
In
an
effort
to
bring
more
hard
currency
into
the
country
the
government
decided
to
promote
tourism
three-year
study
of
various
sites
was
conducted
by
consortium
of
government
and
private
interests
and
the
deserted
island
of
CancÃºn
won
out:
not
only
was
it
beautiful
spot
but
its
use
would
revive
the
flagging
economy
of
the
YucatÃ¡n
and
finally
bring
Quintana
Roo
into
the
fold
The
territory
was
eventually
granted
statehood
in
1974
the
same
year
that
CancÃºn
opened
to
the
public
CancÃºn
is
now
Mexicoâs
most
popular
holiday
destination
pulling
in
almost
three
million
tourists
each
year
New
roads
have
appeared
and
televisions
and
refrigerators
are
now
the
norm
in
villages
that
didnât
even
have
electricity
20
years
ago
Despite
creating
pocket
of
wealth
for
the
region
Mexico
itself
suffered
number
of
crises
in
the
1980s
and
1990s
including
drastic
devaluation
of
the
peso
in
1995
following
months
of
economic
chaos
The
US
extended
40
billion
dollars
in
loans
to
stabilize
the
monetary
system
However
confidence
in
the
politicians
is
still
low
and
the
22%
increase
in
the
price
of
tortillas
the
basic
food
of
the
people
in
early
2000
indicates
that
the
problems
are
not
yet
over
These
questions
are
for
governments
based
in
Mexico
City
many
miles
from
the
YucatÃ¡n
greater
question
for
the
region
itself:
Can
the
development
be
controlled?
What
was
deserted
coastline
two
decades
ago
is
now
bustling
Riviera
Coral
reefs
are
being
damaged
by
careless
divers;
lagoons
that
once
teemed
with
tropical
fish
are
now
being
polluted
by
suntan
lotion;
the
beaches
where
sea
turtles
once
laid
their
eggs
are
being
taken
over
by
sun-beds
and
volleyball
nets;
crocodiles
and
manatees
that
once
cruised
the
coastal
waters
are
now
endangered
species
Conservation
areas
such
as
Rio
Lagartos
in
the
north
give
hope
for
the
future
but
conservationists
lost
one
recent
battle
when
they
were
powerless
to
prevent
the
International
Pier
at
Puerto
Maya
on
Cozumel
from
being
built
directly
on
top
of
North
Paradise
Reef
CancÃºnÂ âÂ in
fact
the
whole
YucatÃ¡n
peninsulaÂ âÂ is
embroiled
in
an
important
struggle
one
that
is
being
faced
all
over
the
worldÂ âÂ the
battle
between
the
conflicting
demands
of
development
and
conservation
What
to
Do
Most
visitors
to
China
come
to
see
the
nationâs
many
excellent
historic
and
cultural
sites
including
the
imperial
treasures
But
there
is
much
else
of
interest
in
this
vast
land
to
make
the
journey
truly
enjoyable
You
will
of
course
want
to
bring
home
at
least
few
souvenirs
and
you
will
have
opportunities
to
attend
presentations
of
an
incredible
range
of
performing
arts
It
will
not
be
difficult
to
fill
your
moments
of
leisure
with
memorable
activities
that
will
make
your
trip
last
well
after
you
return
home
Shopping
After
watching
coachloads
of
foreign
tourists
clamoring
to
buy
souvenirs
at
every
stop
from
the
Forbidden
City
to
the
oases
of
Xinjiang
the
Chinese
authorities
have
opened
shops
wherever
visitors
go
The
Friendship
Stores
found
in
all
significant
tourist
locations
make
for
easy
shopping
They
are
essentially
for
foreigners
only
and
salespeople
speak
several
languages
and
usually
have
all
the
patience
in
the
world
for
repetitive
queries
Foreign
money
may
be
changed
on
the
premises
and
some
credit
cards
are
accepted
But
more
adventurous
travelers
might
stumble
across
the
same
items
in
neighborhood
store
There
the
scene
is
less
relaxed
and
the
language
problem
might
daunt
you
but
at
least
youâll
be
able
to
catch
glimpse
of
Chinese
consumer
society
In
many
cities
arts
and
crafts
department
stores
showcase
the
output
of
local
artisans
Antiques
shops
specialize
in
old
pottery
jewelry
carvings
and
calligraphy
as
well
as
high-quality
reproductions
Since
the
distribution
system
is
unpredictable
old
China
hands
say
you
shouldnât
take
chance:
if
you
find
something
you
like
buy
it
for
it
might
not
be
on
sale
anywhere
else
Prices
are
as
marked;
do
not
try
to
bargain
What
to
Buy
Bargains
are
rare
but
thereâs
much
to
buy
in
Chinaâs
stores
shops
and
markets
Hereâs
an
alphabetically
organized
listing
to
start
you
on
your
rounds
Antiques
From
fossils
to
ancient
coins
Chinese
customs
regulations
prohibit
the
export
of
any
cultural
relics
except
those
marked
with
special
wax
seals;
and
only
fairly
recent
objects
are
given
the
seal
Even
so
browsing
is
fascinating
Remember
that
many
knowledgeable
buyers
will
have
preceded
you
The
authorities
here
peg
prices
to
international
levels
Bamboo
products
In
the
southern
regions
where
bamboo
grows
cottage
industries
turn
out
bamboo
tea
boxes
fans
flutes
chopsticks
walking
sticks
and
furniture
Brocades
and
silk
Since
the
Han
Dynasty
China
has
been
exporting
delicate
silk
fabrics
in
brilliant
colors
These
days
you
can
buy
inexpensive
raw
silk
by
the
meter
or
exquisite
brocades
as
well
as
silk
scarves
ties
and
blouses
Bronzeware
Modern
versions
of
traditional
hotpots
are
useful
in
the
home
as
are
bronze
pitchers
plates
and
vases
(often
engraved
with
intricate
dragon
or
floral
designs)
Carpets
and
rugs
Luxurious
and
colorful
oriental
rugs
of
wool
or
silk
are
tempting

China
(porcelain)
Reproductions
of
classical
designs
or
modern
teapots
cups
plates
and
vases
Shrewd
buyers
point
out
that
price
tags
always
indicate
the
excellence
of
porcelain
(and
of
cloisonne
ware
too)
In
the
line
of
Chinese
text
before
the
actual
price
look
for
the
Chinese
symbols
for
the
numerals
1
2
or
(one
two
or
three
horizontal
lines)
meaning
first
second
or
third
class
If
thereâs
no
number
at
all
it
means
first
class
Chopsticks
Now
that
youâre
becoming
familiar
with
Chinese
cooking
you
might
want
to
collect
the
appropriate
utensils
Elaborate
chopsticks
are
sold
in
their
own
fitted
carrying
casesÂ âÂ handy
for
picnic
or
an
emergency
Cloisonne
The
Chinese
donât
claim
to
have
invented
this
type
of
enamelware
but
they
have
been
doing
it
very
well
for
several
hundred
years
Cloisonne
is
applied
to
plates
vases
and
other
items
Ethnic
novelties
Artisans
from
Chinaâs
ethnic
minority
groups
produce
good
share
of
exotica:
ornaments
and
figurines
ceremonial
knives
and
swords
skullcaps
and
other
headgear
colorful
dresses
and
shirts
and
shaggy
sheepskin
coats
Fans
One
factory
in
Hangzhou
alone
manufactures
10
million
fans
per
year
most
of
them
for
export
They
come
in
several
hundred
varieties
but
the
best
known
folding
fans
are
made
of
fragrant
sandalwood
or
black
paper
Figurines
Ceramic
polychrome
figurines
of
historic
or
legendary
personages
are
popular
as
are
little
animals
with
the
panda
the
most
sought
after
Furniture
Boxwood
mahogany
or
bamboo
screens
chairs
and
chests
with
elaborately
carved
designs
re-create
the
atmosphere
of
old
China
Shipping
abroad
can
be
arranged
Furs
Glossy
sable
or
marten
coats
are
often
displayed
in
Friendship
Stores
The
styling
might
not
be
the
latest
fashion
but
the
price
tag
could
make
all
the
difference
Ginseng
The
all-purpose
Chinese
medicinal
herb
is
becoming
well
known
in
the
West
as
tonic
Small
doses
of
ginseng
in
tea
wine
or
soup
are
claimed
to
be
the
secret
of
enduring
vitality
Herbs
and
spices
Every
market
has
stands
selling
fragrant
spices
Look
above
all
for
varieties
particular
to
the
region;
in
Chongqing
for
instance
you
might
buy
Sichuan
dried
peppers
few
fen
will
buy
an
exotic
gift
especially
welcome
when
the
herbs
or
spices
are
unknown
or
unavailable
at
home
Ivory
Carvings
of
remarkable
intricacy
are
Chinese
specialty
But
only
an
expert
can
distinguish
between
genuine
tusk
and
substitute
material
Obtaining
real
ivory
of
course
means
the
slaughter
of
elephants
and
today
almost
all
import
of
ivory
products
has
been
banned
If
in
doubt
check
with
your
consulate
first
Jade
One
of
the
hardest
of
stones
jade
has
intrigued
the
Chinese
for
at
least
3,000
years
Even
if
you
donât
believe
in
its
mystic
powers
jadeâs
aesthetic
appeal
cannot
be
denied
Kites
In
windy
Beijing
and
many
other
Chinese
cities
high-flying
kites
are
favorite
of
children
and
others
The
designs
are
colorful
original
and
elaborate
Lacquerware
Numerous
layers
of
lacquer
individually
polished
are
applied
to
trays
cups
vases
and
boxes
Lacquer
also
makes
the
ideal
finish
for
tea
and
coffee
services
since
the
material
resists
boiling
water
as
well
as
the
chemicals
in
tea
and
coffee
Luggage
One
answer
to
the
problem
of
excessive
buying
might
be
to
buy
additional
luggage
to
carry
your
souvenirs
home
The
Chinese
make
good
cheap
sturdy
suitcases
of
all
sizes
Or
you
can
pick
up
local
imitation
of
Western
executive
attachÃ©
case
Musical
instruments
Such
European
and
Chinese
musical
instruments
as
violin
guitar
flute
and
pipa
(a
plucked
stringed
instrument)
are
well
made
and
usually
well
priced
Paintings
Squadrons
of
artists
copy
the
traditional
drawings
and
paintings
by
hand
lengthy
scroll
can
take
as
long
as
ten
days
to
complete
brushstroke
by
brushstroke
with
the
details
of
landscape
intended
to
be
viewed
in
sections
not
all
at
once
Artists
also
produce
original
meditations
on
venerable
themes
The
scrolls
have
the
advantage
of
being
already
rolled
up
for
packing
Paper
art
The
Chinese
who
invented
paper
are
thought
to
have
devised
the
decorative
art
of
paper
cutting
nearly
2,000
years
ago
With
great
skill
scissors-wielding
paper
cutters
produce
intricate
scenes
suitable
for
framing
Rubbings
and
reproductions
Stone
rubbings
of
inscriptions
from
ancient
temples
or
of
classical
calligraphy
on
stone
pillars
make
popular
(and
portable)
souvenirs
In
some
museums
you
will
find
shops
selling
reproductions
of
their
most
famous
archaeological
exhibits
(for
example
the
flying
horse
in
Lanzhou)
Tiny
facsimiles
of
the
Xiâan
warriors
are
now
available
in
many
parts
of
the
country
Seals
These
ink
stamps
(also
called
âchopsâ)
are
the
traditional
Chinese
substitute
for
handwritten
signatures
You
can
have
one
carved
just
for
you
with
your
name
incisedÂ âÂ perhaps
in
ancient
Chinese
block
charactersÂ âÂ in
soapstone
plastic
jade
or
ivory
Souvenirs
In
any
local
department
store
or
street
market
youâre
likely
to
come
across
some
very
Chinese
inspirations:
acupuncture
charts
and
dolls
those
ubiquitous
thermos
flasks
tea
mugs
with
lids
padded
jackets
posters
and
so
on
Tea
collection
of
Chinese
teas
(black
green
semi-fermented
and
flower-petal)
makes
an
inexpensive
useful
and
long-lasting
souvenir
Tea
is
frequently
packaged
in
special
artistically
decorated
containers
Toys
Cheap
and
unusual
childrenâs
toys
from
cuddly
animals
to
mechanical
games
are
being
manufactured
in
increasing
numbers
in
China
Woolens
An
unexpected
bargain
is
cashmere
sweaters
in
all
styles
and
colors
Other
woolens
too
can
be
economical
good-quality
purchases
Entertainment
After
grueling
day
of
sightseeing
you
might
not
be
too
disappointed
to
discover
that
an
eveningâs
entertainment
starts
and
ends
early
Nightlife
stays
on
high
cultural
plane
far
removed
from
the
nightclub
scene
of
Europe
or
North
America
Chinese
performances
combine
amusement
with
edification
in
glittering
package
few
Western
impresarios
could
afford
to
mount
Chinese
Opera
The
Chinese
hospitably
assume
that
foreigners
canât
bear
more
than
about
ten
minutes
of
traditional
Chinese
opera
You
might
indeed
find
the
voices
shrill
and
the
mannerisms
maddening
(many
characters
seem
to
spend
most
of
the
time
fussing
with
their
sleeves
which
can
unroll
to
the
floor)
So
you
should
not
mind
if
your
guide
or
host
rushes
you
out
of
the
theater
into
the
early
evening
traffic
But
if
you
persevere
you
will
begin
to
understand
what
the
Chinese
see
in
this
age-old
art
form
If
you
fail
youâve
still
enjoyed
the
splendid
costumes
and
makeup
the
acrobatics
that
enliven
some
regional
versions
and
the
experience
of
being
in
theater
surrounded
by
local
people
Peking
opera
is
the
version
most
familiar
to
Westerners
but
other
regions
have
their
own
variants
If
possible
familiarize
yourself
with
the
plot
in
advance
Ideologically
uplifting
operas
were
the
only
ones
permitted
during
the
Cultural
Revolution;
classical
stories
were
banned
But
today
both
classical
and
modern
works
are
presented
If
you
have
an
interpreter
at
hand
youâll
understand
why
some
scenes
animate
the
audience
and
others
donât
The
words
of
the
songs
are
projected
onto
screens
alongside
the
proscenium
arch
to
clarify
the
nuances
of
tonal
language
set
to
music
Apart
from
the
set
pieces
most
of
the
music
is
percussive
and
serves
to
support
and
reflect
the
action
and
mood
Props
are
minimal
and
the
action
is
subtle:
an
actor
closes
an
invisible
door
with
mime
gesture
and
anyone
walking
with
riding
crop
must
be
understood
to
be
mounted
on
horse
But
the
heroic
characters
couldnât
ever
be
mistaken
for
the
snarling
villains
Puppets
Acrobats
and
Folklore
Groups
Popular
with
adults
and
children
the
Chinese
shadow
play
(a
2,000-year-old
art
form)
dramatizes
familiar
legends
The
two-dimensional
puppets
manipulated
behind
silk
screen
can
jump
and
fly
giving
the
colorful
silhouettes
an
advantage
over
the
actors
in
Chinese
opera
The
busy
puppeteers
give
voice
to
their
characters
often
in
song
Professional
and
amateur
shadow-play
troupes
also
put
on
shows
with
marionettes
The
so-called
acrobatic
shows
staged
for
tourist
groups
are
more
fun
than
you
might
expect
The
trapeze
artists
of
course
are
first-class
and
so
are
the
contortionists
and
human
pyramid
acts
But
they
also
throw
in
jugglers
and
magicians
and
even
comics
and
you
donât
have
to
understand
word
to
join
in
the
laughter
Typically
the
âChinese
folkloreâ
performances
are
organized
especially
for
tourists
Shows
feature
the
costumes
songs
and
dances
of
the
national
minority
groupsÂ âÂ often
as
foreign
to
Chinese
audience
as
they
are
to
visitors
from
abroad
These
evenings
are
usually
uplifting
and
not
very
long
Concerts
and
Ballet
During
the
Cultural
Revolution
Beethoven
and
Tchaikovsky
were
banned
and
many
musicians
banished
to
the
countryside
for
âre-education.â
So
if
you
go
to
concert
today
youâll
sense
the
drama
of
recovery
from
mad
xenophobia
This
neednât
obscure
the
fact
that
some
professional
musicians
havenât
yet
reached
world
standards
But
the
enthusiasm
of
players
and
audience
is
exciting
in
itself
Ballet
vehicle
for
ideological
indoctrination
during
the
1960s
and
1970s
is
much
less
restricted
today
Folk
legends
are
often
source
of
inspiration
and
classical
European
works
are
sometimes
performed
with
elaborate
costumes
sets
and
lighting
effects
And
Nightcap
With
varying
degrees
of
success
the
tourist
hotels
try
to
meet
foreignersâ
demands
for
quiet
place
to
have
drink
and
chat
Only
the
newest
hotels
that
were
built
with
international
cooperation
contain
bars
reminiscent
of
those
in
Europe
or
America
The
others
are
likely
to
be
quaint
rather
than
cozy
Where
To
Go
Beijing
has
fascinating
districts
and
neighborhoods
to
stroll
However
the
main

youâll
be
taking
frequent
taxi
bus
or
subway
rides
no
matter
where
your
hotel
is
located

are
common
even
today
with
nearly
half
of
the
capitalâs
population
living
in
some
form
of
rectangular
courtyard
compound

hutongs
and
siheyuans
are

under
threat
of
urban
renewal

Ancient
Observatory
Beijingâs
Ancient
Observatory
(Guguan
Xiang
Tai)
was
built
in
1442
under
the
Ming
Dynasty
It
is
at
the
intersection
of
Changâan
Avenue
and
the
Second
Ring
Road
East;
almost
immediately
below
it
is
Beijing
subway
station
The
observatory
supplanted
one
created
by
Kublai
Khan
Inside
the
brick
tower
which
looks
like
remnant
of
the
old

wall
are
astronomical
displays
including
gold

Sanlitun
Located
in
the
heart
of
large
foreign
diplomatic
district
between
Dongzhimenwai
Dajie
and
the
Liangma
River
Sanlitun
has
become
the
nightlife
district
of
Beijing
Many
of
its
60
or
more
small
cafÃ©sÂ âÂ offering
international
cuisine
by
day
and
drinking
and
music
by
nightÂ âÂ are
located
on
Sanlitun
Lu
which
has
been
officially
named
Sanlitun
Bar
Street
(Sanlitun
Jiuba
Jie)
Many
of
Beijingâs
expatriates
and
foreign
tourists
as
well
as
the
cityâs
younger
Chinese
gather
here
each
summer
for
the
sidewalk
drinking
dining
and
people-watching
On
the
west
side
of
Sanlitun
Lu
there
are
two
open-air
markets
one
selling
rattan
furniture
and
bamboo
crafts
the
other
offering

While
Sanlitun
is
devoid
of
historic

it
stands
out
as
modern
Beijingâs
most
international
neighborhood
West
Beijing
Two
of
Beijingâs
top
attractions
the
Summer
Palace
and
the
Western
Hills
are
located
northwest
of
the
capitalâs
relentless
urban
sprawl
This
is
the
beautiful
hilly
countryside
of
the
Haidian
District
(home
to
Chinaâs
top
universities
and
computer
technology
developers)
And
closer
to
city
center
the
western
precincts
of
Beijing
are
the
site
of
four
major
temples
the
Beijing
Art
Museum
and
the
Beijing
Zoo
Summer
Palace
The
site
of
imperial
palaces
since
the
reign
of
Kublai
Khan
the
Summer
Palace
(Yi
He
Yuan)
achieved
its
present
form
during
reconstructions
from
1749
to
1764
Emperor
Qianlong
saw
to
the
expansion
of
the
park
its
hills
and
its
lake
and
he
added
pavilions
and
halls
that
stand
today
The
imperial
court
used
the
Summer
Palace
as
its
summer
home
escaping
the
heat
of
central
Beijing
and
the
Forbidden
City
Today
it
is
the
playground
of
locals
and
tourists
alike
Many
say
it
is
the
most
beautiful
imperial
garden
in
ChinaÂ âÂ a
large-scale
garden
equivalent
to
park
or
estate
The
Summer
Palace
was
twice
destroyed
after
its
expansion
under
the
early
Qing
emperors
In
1860
during
the
Second
Opium
War
British
and
French
troops
invaded
Beijing
and
ransacked
and
ruined
many
of
the
buildings
Empress
Dowager
Cixi
saw
to
complete
restoration
in
1886
but
the
Western
armies
returned
in
1900
in
retaliation
for
the
siege
of
the
Foreign
Legation
during
the
Boxer
Rebellion
Undaunted
the
Empress
Dowager
completed
second
restoration
in
1903
The
Summer
Palace
became
her
countryside
version
of
the
Forbidden
City
her
residence
of
choice
even
when
the
heat
of
summer
diminished
Like
the
Forbidden
City
the
Summer
Palace
was
opened
to
the
public
in
1925
The
280-hectare
(700-acre)
Summer
Palace
is
dominated
by
Kunming
Lake
which
itself
is
subdivided
into
West
Lake
and
South
Lake
by
several
causeways
Longevity
Hill
rises
above
the
north
shore
Behind
its
peaks
is
version
of
Beijingâs
Back
Lakes
created
during
the
Qing
Dynasty
The
main
strolling
area
is
along
the
north
shore
of
Kunming
Lake
where
the
pavilions
and
courtyards
are
linked
by
the
Long
Corridor
(Chang
Lang)
This
covered
promenade
stretches
777
(2,550
ft)
from
the
Eastern
Halls
west
to
the
Marble
Boat
First
built
in
1750
it
consists
of
273
crossbeam
sections
and
pavilions
Nearly
every
exposed
portion
of
its
beams
panels
and
pillars
is
decorated
with
painted
scene
from
Chinese
myth
history
literature
or
geographyÂ âÂ 10,000
brightly
painted
panels
in
all
Among
the
important
imperial
buildings
on
the
east
side
of
the
Long
Corridor
four
are
worth
viewing
The
Hall
of
Benevolent
Longevity
(Renshou
Dian)
is
where
Empress
Dowager
Cixi
received
court
members
from
her
Dragon
Throne
(which
is
still
in
place)
The
Hall
of
Jade
Ripples
(Yulan
Dian)
is
where
Cixi
confined
her
nephew
Emperor
Guangxu
while
she
ruled
in
his
place
The
Hall
for
Cultivating
Happiness
(Yile
Dian)
served
as
the
Empress
Dowagerâs
private
viewing
box
for
performances
in
the
adjacent
three-story
theater
which
was
built
to
honor
her
60th
birthday
Cixi
celebrated
many
of
her
birthdays
at
the
Summer
Palace
and
she
was
especially
fond
of
theatrical
performances
in
which
she
sometimes
played
role
This
theater
now
contains
some
of
her
imperial
garments
jewelry
and
cosmetics
as
well
as
Mercedes-Benz
said
to
be
the
first
passenger
car
in
China
The
Long
Corridor
begins
at
fourth
Qing
building
the
Hall
of
Happiness
and
Longevity
(Leshou
Tang)
where
the
Empress
Dowager
slept
The
curtained
bed
the
lamps
and
most
of
the
furniture
are
original
Midway
along
the
Long
Corridor
at
the
foot
of
Longevity
Hill
is
the
Hall
of
Dispelling
Clouds
(Pai
Yun
Dian)
where
Cixi
held
her
birthday
parties
This
hall
now
houses
collection
of
birthday
gifts
including
the
portrait
of
the
Empress
Dowager
painted
by
Hollandâs
Hubert
Vos
upon
the
occasion
of
her
70th
birthday
in
1905
The
Long
Corridor
ends
at
the
Pavilion
for
Listening
to
the
Orioles
(Tingli
Guan)
where
there
is
now
restaurant
serving
Qing
dynasty
imperial
dishes
Just
beyond
this
point
is
the
most
famous
(or
perhaps
notorious)
monument
in
the
Summer
Palace
the
Marble
Boat
known
officially
as
the
Boat
of
Purity
and
Ease
To
Beijingers
it
is
Chinaâs
âship
of
fools.â
Rebuilt
with
lavish
materials
(stone
and
stained
glass)
by
the
Empress
Dowager
in
1893
this
36-m
(118-ft)
statue
of
boat
was
restored
(it
is
said)
with
funds
meant
to
shore
up
Chinaâs
woeful
navy
but
it
was
not
long
before
Japan
completely
humiliated
China
in
battles
at
sea
Cixi
has
been
blamed
ever
since
for
her
profligate
and
selfish
ways
combined
with
her
Machiavellian
rise
from
concubine
to
Empress
popularly
held
to
be
the
cause
of
Chinaâs
weakness
and
the
fall
of
the
last
dynasty
The
Summer
Palace
remains
as
visible
testimony
to
the
extravagance
of
the
late
Qing
Dynasty
at
the
expense
of
Chinaâs
freedom
and
prosperity
at
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
While
many
scholars
doubt
that
Empress
Dowager
Cixi
played
such
villainous
role
her
Summer
Palace
is
undoubtedly
lavish
enough
to
have
launched
countless
tales
of
luxury
and
decadence
Even
today
the
view
of
Longevity
Hill
and
its
scores
of
tile-roofed
pavilions
and
towers
enjoyed
from
pleasure
barge
drifting
across
Lake
Kunming
is
scene
from
dream
of
old
China
in
which
emperors
and
empresses
led
lives
in
gardens
of
unimaginable
splendor
Here
even
the
bridgesÂ âÂ connecting
lake
isles
to
the
palace
shoresÂ âÂ wouldnât
be
out
of
place
in
Ming
or
Qing
scroll
painting
particularly
the
celebrated
Seventeen-Arch
Bridge
(Shiqi
Kong
Qiao)
150
(492
ft)
long
and
built
of
white
marble
Not
far
from
the
Summer
Palace
is
the
site
of
the
Old
Summer
Palace
(Yuan
Ming
Yuan)
When
Emperor
Kangxi
built
this
imperial
park
in
the
18th
century
it
had
no
equal
However
after
its
destruction
in
1860
by
French
and
British
troops
it
was
left
to
decay
and
the
courtâs
attention
turned
to
restoring
the
new
Summer
Palace
All
thatâs
left
now
in
the
Old
Summer
Palace
are
some
of
the
most
haunting
ruins
in
China
particularly
in
section
known
as
the
Garden
of
Eternal
Spring
(Changchun
Yuan)
where
European-style
halls
marble
fountains
mazes
and
concert
stand
are
now
broken
jumble
of
ornately
carved
columns
and
arches
Every
few
years
there
are
fresh
announcements
that
the
Old
Summer
Palace
will
be
restored
to
its
former
glories
For
now
it
provides
quiet
picnic
grounds
amidst
the
ruins
of
an
empire
Western
Hills
When
Chinaâs
rulers
really
wanted
to
escape
the
heat
of
the
city
they
went
farther
west
than
the
Summer
Palace
to
the
Western
Hills
(Xi
Shan)
romantically
known
today
as
Fragrant
Hills
Park
(Xiangshan
Gong
yuan)
Imperial
villas
first
dotted
these
hillsidesÂ âÂ 27
km
(17
miles)
from
BeijingÂ âÂ more
than
800
years
ago
But
it
was
the
Qing
Emperor
Qianlong
who
converted
the
Western
Hills
into
formal
mountain
retreat
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
court
complete
with
its
own
temples
lakes
gardens
and
even
zoo
Late
autumn
is
the
favorite
season
for
park
visitors
these
days
when
leaves
turn
fiery
red
However
locals
as
well
as
tourists
come
to
the
Western
Hills
year
round
for
the
natural
beauty
and
historic
sites
Two
renowned
temples
still
survive
in
the
Western
Hills
Near
the
parkâs
north
gate
are
the
four
great
halls
of
the
Temple
of
the
Sleeping
Buddha
(Wo
Fo
Si)
In
the
final
hall
(Wo
Fo
Dian)
there
is
5-m
(16-ft)
lacquered
statue
of
the
reclining
Buddha
(dated
1321)
about
to
attain
nirvana
Inside
the
parkâs
north
gate
is
an
even
larger
complex
the
Temple
of
the
Azure
Clouds
(Biyun
Si)
which
ascends
the
hillside
The
body
of
Sun
Yat-sen
founder
of
the
modern
Chinese
Republic
once
lay
in
state
here
before
removal
to
Nanjing;
his
hat
coat
and
coffin
are
still
at
this
temple
So
too
is
the
fascinating
Luohan
Hall
Luohans
are
followers
of
Buddha
who
achieve
enlightenment
but
choose
to
stay
on
Earth
to
show
others
the
way
The
500
luohans
portrayed
in
this
templeâs
carved
figures
range
from
the
ecstatic
to
the
gruesome
from
the
common
to
the
surreal
Topping
the
temple
is
the
Diamond
Throne
Pagoda
(Jinggang
Baozuo
Ta)
built
in
1748
in
the
Indian
style
with
four
pagodas
and
two
stupas
surrounding
35-m
(115-ft)
white
pagoda
The
most
popular
site
in
the
Western
Hills
is
natural:
summit
known
as
Incense
Burner
Peak
(Xiang
Lu
Feng)
named
for
the
image
created
when
fog
comes
sweeping
over
it
There
is
winding
path
to
the
top
known
as
Gui
Jian
Chou
(âEven
the
Devil
is
Terrifiedâ)
as
well
as
chair
lift
(20
minutes
each
way)
At
the
557-m
(1,827-ft)
summit
there
are
pavilions
vendors
and
small
paths
into
surrounding
forests
There
are
also
fine
views
of
the
lakes
temples
pavilions
and
pagodas
below
which
can
be
explored
upon
return
On
clear
day
one
is
tempted
to
linger
Here
thereâs
an
emperorâs
view
to
the
southeast
commanding
both
the
pavilions
of
the
Summer
Palace
and
the
skyscrapers
of
downtown
Beijing
White
Cloud
Temple
Beijingâs
most
active
Daoist
complex
Bai
Yun
Guan
is
better
known
as
White
Cloud
Temple
This
is
also
the
capitalâs
most
fascinating
religious
site
place
of
superstition
and
incense
mystery
and
spirited
worship
As
Chinaâs
leading
indigenous
religion
Daoism
differs
from
Buddhism
(transplanted
from
India)
not
so
much
in
the
architecture
of
its
temples
and
the
art
of
its
statuary
(these
are
often
quite
similar
in
style)
as
in
its
practices
and
beliefs
Daoism
emphasized
nature
the
individual
and
the
Way
but
in
its
organized
form
it
relies
on
huge
pantheon
of
gods
goddesses
and
supernatural
icons
promising
miracles
At
Baiyunguan
the
first
courtyard
features
the
Wind
Containing
Bridge
where
visitors
attempt
to
ensure
their
good
fortune
by
striking
17th-century
copper
bell
with
coins
In
the
Spring
Hall
for
the
Jade
Emperor
worshippers
touch
the
golden
feet
of
statues
representing
the
gods
of
wealth
In
the
side
halls
there
are
shrines
where
the
devout
can
appeal
to
the
proper
god
to
cure
eye
problems
ensure
the
birth
of
son
pass
an
examination
get
good
job
and
increase
longevity
Every
one
of
these
âwishing
hallsâ
is
usually
jammed
with
locals
who
are
often
dressed
in
their
most
expensive
clothes
for
the
tour
Festivals
on
the
first
and
fifteenth
of
the
lunar
month
are
especially
lively
times
to
visit
At
the
rear
of
the
complex
there
is
large
rock
garden
courtyard
and
classrooms
where
many
novice
monks
are
trained
in
Daoism
Baiyunguan
was
founded
in
739
and
received
its
present
name
in
1394
Most
of
the
halls
date
from
the
Qing
Dynasty
although
Yuanchen
Hall
where
visitors
try
to
locate
the
deity
on
the
zodiac
of
their
birthday
dates
from
the
time
of
Kublai
Khan
Just
south
of
this
temple
complex
is
Tianning
Si
Ta
the
Temple
of
Heavenly
Tranquillity
Pagoda
built
during
the
Liao
Dynasty
(907â1125)
making
it
Beijingâs
oldest
surviving
building
The
13-story
tower
is
58
(190
ft)
high
and
is
decorated
with
fine
Buddhist
carvings
White
Pagoda
Temple
Extensively
renovated
and
enlarged
in
1998
the
White
Pagoda
Temple
(Bai
Ta
Si)
is
renowned
for
its
Tibetan-style
pagoda
(usually
called
dagoba
or
stupa)
The
white
pagoda
at
this
temple
is
larger
than
the
more
famous
one
in
Beihai
Park
In
fact
it
is
the
largest
of
its
type
in
China
built
in
1279
during
the
reign
of
Kublai
Khan
The
main

of
the
White
Pagoda
Temple
(located
on
the
north
side
of
Fuchingmennei
Dajie)
the
first
courtyard
and
the
museum
are
new
The
museum
houses
many
Buddhist
artifacts
and
statues
discovered
on
the
temple
grounds
as
well
as
sutra
copied
out
by
Emperor
Qianlong
This
rare
manuscript
unearthed
in
1978
was
composed
in
the
emperorâs
own
hand
in
1753
Beyond
the
museum
to
the
north
are
three
finely
restored
prayer
halls
The
Hall
of
the
Great
Enlightened
Ones
is
stuffed
with
thousands
of
little
Buddhas
The
white
pagoda
itself
rising
51
(167
ft)
is
last
and
like
most
dagobas
remains
sealed
its
holy
treasures
and

somewhere
beneath

Nanchang
River
is
one
of
Beijingâs
most
beautiful
sights
the
Five
Pagoda
Temple
(Wu
Ta
Si)
Its
singular
main
hall
consists
of
square
stone
building
71â2
(25
ft)
high
its
outside
walls
decorated
with
one
thousand
niches
each
containing
an
engraved
Buddha
The
hall
is
crowned
with
cluster
of
five
elaborate
towering
pagodas
with
stairs
inside
leading
up
to
view
from
the
roof
The
five-pagoda
building
is
more
Indian
than
Chinese
in
style
It
was
built
in
1473
during
the
early
Ming
Dynasty
The
temple
was
originally
part
of
the
larger
Zhengjue
Temple
complex
(built
during
the
reign
of
Ming
Emperor
Yongle
in
the
1420s
and
sacked
by
Western
troops
in
1860
and
1900)
On
the
same
grounds
today
is
the
Beijing
Stone
Engraving
Art
Museum
an
open-air
display
of
over
500
ancient
stone
carvings
and
inscribed
stone
pillars
Big
Bell
Temple
Big
Bell
Temple
(Da
Zhong
Si)
received
its
apt
name
in
1743
when
the
largest
bronze
bell
in
China
was
placed
here
This
huge
bell
weighing
34,000
kg
(46
tons)
and
measuring
(23
ft)
high
was
cast
in
1420
just
as
the
Forbidden
City
was
finished
It
is
on
display
in
its
own
pavilion
at
the
rear
of
the
Big
Bell
Temple
Locals
often
climb
the
stairs
to
the
top
of
the
big
bell
and
drop
coins
through
an
opening
for
good
luck
ritual
that
thousands
of
pilgrims
in
the
past
followed
Since
the
early
1980s
the
Big
Bell
Temple
has
served
as
Chinaâs
bell
museum
with
over
700
bells
in
its
collection
few
of
the
bells
are
modern
(cast
to
commemorate
recent
events)
and
some
are
from
foreign
countries
but
most
are
Chinese
antiquities
Among
the
bells
displayed
in
the
various
halls
and
pavilions
are
some
that
are
4,000
years
old
For
small
fee
visitors
can
sound
set
of
stone
chimes
that
date
from
the
Warring
States
Period
(475â221
b.c.)
Beijing
Art
Museum
Doubling
as
museum
and
temple
the
Beijing
Art
Museum
(Zhongguo
Meishuguan)
is
housed
in
the
halls
of
the
Wanshou
Temple
the
Temple
of
Longevity
Although
the
temple
renovated
in
1761
by
Emperor
Qianlong
is
no
longer
active
it
contains
many
old
structures
including
the
bell
and
drum
towers
in
the
first
courtyard
which
date
from
1577
The
Empress
Dowager
Cixi
used
to
lodge
overnight
in
this
temple
on
her
voyage
by
royal
barge
from
the
Forbidden
City
to
the
Summer
Palace
The
large
meditation
hall
at
the
center
of
the
temple
complex
is
now
an
art
gallery
containing
modern
Chinese
oil
paintings
Side
halls
feature
other
art
exhibits
ceramics
historic
relics
and
artworks
and
crafts
for

At
the
rear
of
Wanshou
Temple
is
large
rock
garden
with
shrines
to
the
gods
of
three
of
Buddhismâs
sacred
mountains
in
China
two
pavilions
built
in
1761
(one
housing
stone
tablet
with
the
engraved
signature
of
Emperor
Qianlong)
and
two
arched
gates
constructed
in
the
style
of
18th-century
Europe
Beijing
Zoo
The
Beijing
Zoo
(Beijing
Dongwu
Yuan)
is
the
creation
of
Empress
Dowager
Cixi
who
in
1908
converted
this
private
Ming
Dynasty
garden
estate
into
preserve
for
some
700
exotic
animals
imported
from
Germany
The
entrance
gate
dates
from
the
late
Qing
Dynasty
and
many
of
the
exhibition
halls
seem
nearly
as
old
Even
the
outdoor
pens
seem
quite
dated
With
some
6,000
animals
the
zoo
is
the
largest
in
China
but
despite
its
notable
collection
of
giant
pandas
Siberian
tigers
golden
monkeys
and
red-crowned
cranes
the
facility
is
in
need
of
modernization
Few
foreign
visitors
are
happy
with
the
size
and
condition
of
the
cages
although
the
new
Panda
Garden
featuring
half-dozen
adult
pandas
and
twin
babies
is
bit
more
spacious
and
step
in
the
right
direction
Most
of
the
zooâs
recent
major
funding
has
gone
to
the
creation
of
the
adjacent
Beijing
Aquarium
state-of-the-art
marine
park
scheduled
to
have
50,000
aquatic
species
in
residence
Excursions
The
Great
Wall
is
Chinaâs
most
popular
attraction
From
Beijing
splendid
sections
of
the
wall
can
be
enjoyed
at
several
locations
Less
visited
(and
less
crowded)
are
two
of
Chinaâs
greatest
imperial
cemeteries:
the
Ming
Tombs
and
the
Eastern
Qing
Tombs
Two
other
major
excursions
from
Beijing
are
the
Peking
Man
Museum
at
Zhoudian
and
the
vast
imperial
retreat
and
temples
of
Chengde
Great
Wall
Construction
on
the
Great
Wall
began
as
long
ago
as
the
fifth
century
b.c.;
it
winds
across
northern
China
for
over
10,000
km
(6,200
miles)
However
the
Great
Wall
(Wanli
Chang
Cheng)
that
most
visitors
see
consists
of
few
beautifully
restored
segments
near
Beijing
that
were
built
extended
or
refortified
during
the
Ming
Dynasty
(a.d
1368â1644)
The
Ming
builders
were
the
first
to
finish
these
massive
earthen
fortifications
with
brick
They
built
new
section
of
the
wall
running
for
630
km
(390
miles)
just
north
of
Beijing
as
massive
buffer
and
early
warning
system
against
invaders
from
the
north
This
stratagem
was
to
fail
as
the
Manchus
eventually
broke
through
overthrew
the
Ming
seized
Beijing
and
established
the
Qing
Dynasty
in
1644Â ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Â Chinaâs
last
imperial
line
Hundreds
of
thousands
of
laborers
were
conscripted
over
the
centuries
to
extend
and
repair
the
Great
Wall
and
many
of
them
lie
buried
in
its
ruins
In
the
seventh
century
a.d
over
million
workers
were
said
to
be
involved
in
this
project
but
in
the
centuries
sinceÂ âÂ until
the
Ming
DynastyÂ âÂ much
of
the
wall
fell
into
ruin
Even
today
most
of
its
length
has
not
been
kept
up
the
earthen
remnants
barely
visible
While
it
is
often
reported
that
the
Great
Wall
is
the
only
manmade
object
visible
from
the
moon
the
claim
is
dubious
at
best
Still
it
is
Chinaâs
grandest
achievement
on
par
with
Egyptâs
pyramids
and
handful
of
other
ancient
wonders
of
the
world
The
Great
Wall
is
best
appreciated
at
four
main
sites
north
of
Beijing:
Badaling
Mutianyu
Simatai
and
Juyongguan
Three
of
these
four
segments
have
been
carefully
refurbished
with
the
exception
of
Simatai
which
is
largely
untouched
since
the
days
of
the
early
Ming
Dynasty
The
earthen
foundations
of
the
wall
and
watchtowers
as
well
as
much
of
the
brick-work
are
original
most
of
it
300
to
500
years
old
although
extensive
remodeling
and
fresh
materials
have
been
added
The
look
and
the
feel
are
authentic
enough
once
one
is
on
the
wall
itself
out
of
sight
of
the
shops
vendors
tour
buses
parking
lots
and
cable
cars
below
The
hordes
of
tourists
are
another
modern
addition
of
course
but
it
is
possible
at
all
these
sites
to
walk
beyond
the
crowds
The
steep
mountain
scenery
is
spectacular
and
the
air
is
usually
quite
clear
The
sheer
steepness
of
the
wallâs
stone
stairs
and
the
precarious
footing
provided
by
the
irregular
treads
are
what
most
surprise
first-time
visitors
As
it
snakes
up
and
down
the
peaks
and
ridges
the
wall
conforms
to
challenging
topography
one
that
leaves
many
tourists
gasping
for
breath
But
the
views
from
Chinaâs
ancient
Dragon
of
Stone
make
the
journey
unforgettable
Carefully
restored
in
1957
the
Great
Wall
at
Badaling
67
km
(42
miles)
northwest
of
Beijing
is
the
most-visited
portion
of
the
wall
The
mountain
setting
is
spectacular
and
the
wall
rises
and
falls
steeply
as
it
winds
up
and
down
the
ridges
About
(24
ft)
high
and
(18
ft)
wide
this
Ming
Dynasty
fortification
is
built
of
tamped
earth
stone
and
brick
Beacon
towers
of
stone
and
brick
are
mounted
at
regular
intervals
It
is
possible
to
walk
the
stairs
of
the
restored
section
for
about
km
(11â2
miles)
before
reaching
the
crumbling
remains
of
the
original
wall
on
either
end
At
the
northern
terminus
there
is
cable
car
connecting
the
wall
to
parking
lot
below
The
parking
lots
at
the
base
of
the
wall
are
filled
with
vendors
stores
restaurants
and
other
modern
attractions
including
cinema
and
KFC
fast-food
outlet
Badaling
is
crowded
especially
from
June
through
September
but
it
is
quite
beautiful
Equally
attractive
is
the
second-most
visited
section
of
the
Great
Wall
at
Mutianyu
88
km
(55
miles)
northeast
of
Beijing
Mutianyu
was
opened
to
tourists
in
1986
to
relieve
the
crowding
at
Badaling
There
is
also
cable
car
at
Mutianyu
eliminating
the
20-minute
hike
up
to
the
wall
and
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
there
is
again
village
of
vendors
shops
and
cafÃ©s
Mutianyu
is
one
of
the
oldest
restored
sections
of
the
Great
Wall
in
the
Beijing
area
thought
to
have
been
built
under
the
Ming
rulers
nearly
500
years
ago
Visitors
can
walk
well
over
kilometer
(nearly
mile)
atop
these
ramparts
from
watchtower
to
watchtower
At
either
end
you
can
view
the
crumbling
wall
running
to
the
horizon
broken
but
still
visible
In
the
early
spring
and
late
fall
particularly
on
weekdays
the
Great
Wall
at
Mutianya
is
not
very
crowded
Surrounded
by
its
renowned
green
forests
it
is
pleasant
alternative
to
Badaling
The
Great
Wall
at
Juyongguan
58
km
(36
miles)
northwest
of
Beijing
on
the
way
to
the
Badaling
section
is
the
newest
portion
of
the
wall
open
to
tourism
(1998)
and
the
nearest
to
the
capital
Juyongguan
contains
massive
guard
tower
marking
one
of
the
Great
Wallâs
most
celebrated
mountain
passes
This
guard
tower
built
in
1345
is
decorated
in
Buddhist
carvings
with
inscriptions
in
Chinese
Tibetan
Sanskrit
and
languages
of
the
northern
tribes
Some
of
the
temples
and
parks
clustered
at
the
pass
in
the
days
of
the
Ming
dynasty
have
also
been
restored
here
The
wall
can
be
walked
for
km
(21â2
miles)
as
it
winds
over
the
peaks
of
the
Taihang
Mountains
The
least
restored
least
crowded
major
segment
of
the
Great
Wall
near
Beijing
is
at
Simatai
124
km
(77
miles)
northeast
of
the
capital
Not
only
is
Simatai
rather
far
from
the
capital
it
is
also
quite
uncrowded
and
unreconstructed
Its
stairways
and
watchtowers
resemble
those
crumbling
edifices
one
can
only
glimpse
from
Badaling
Mutianyu
and
Juyongguan
The
natural
scenery
is
dramatic
and
the
ruined
state
of
the
wall
gives
Simatai
romantic
feel
(although
there
is
cable
car
to
the
top)
It
is
also
dangerous
with
broken
stairways
leading
up
some
of
the
70-degree
inclines
Other
portions
are
in
such
ruins
that
one
must
walk
along
the
outside
of
the
wall
on
steep
narrow
paths
where
the
footing
is
difficult
From
the
village
at
the
base
of
Simatai
there
is
half-mile
gravel
path
to
the
first
stairway
which
skirts
the
small
Simatai
Reservoir
The
reservoir
divides
the
Simatai
wall
from
another
section
known
as
Jinshanling
which
adventurous
hikers
can
also
tackle
Simatai
consists
of
14
beacon
towers
each
about
400
(a
quarter
mile)
apart
which
were
once
used
to
transmit
fire
and
smoke
signalsÂ âÂ tower
by
towerÂ âÂ to
the
Chinese
armies
encamped
below
should
an
enemy
be
sighted
The
highest
of
the
beacon
towers
(known
as
Wangjinglou)
stands
at
an
elevation
of
986
(3,235
ft)
affording
grand
view
southwest
toward
Beijing
Locals
say
the
lights
of
the
capital
are
visible
on
clear
evenings
from
here

The
tomb
of
Emperor

is
the
largest
although
its
underground
palace
where
the
emperor
and
his

are
buried
has
not
been
opened
Nor
have
the
16
satellite
vaults
where
Yongleâs
concubines
are
entombed
The
massive
courtyards
and
pavilions
above
Yongleâs
burial
chambers
have
been
restored
and
they
house
some
of
the
Ming
Tombsâ
excavated

The
burial
palace
of
Emperor
Wanli
(Ding

honors
the
13th
Ming
emperor
who
ruled
from
1573
to
1620
His

impressive
The
Ming
Tombs
were
once
staple
of
tours
to
the
Great

(1711â1799)
Emperor
Kangxi
(1654â1722)
and
the
notorious
Empress
Dowager

The
tomb
of
Emperor
Kangxi
(Jing
Ling)
is
also
unopened
but
its
magnificent
above-ground
halls
contain
many
original
imperial
treasures
including
Kangxiâs
Dragon
Throne
The
tomb
of
Emperor
Qianlong
(Yu

underground
it
consists
of
nine
immense
vaults
and
the
marble
coffins
of
the
Manchu
emperor
and
his
five
favorite
consorts
The
most
lavish
tomb
is
that
of
Empress
Dowager
Cixi
Above

The
cave
on

Bone
Hill
where
Peking
Man
lived
690,000
years
ago
showed
evidence
of
community
numbering
up
to

Nearby
caves
contained
fossils
and
artifacts
from
more-recent
Stone

settlements
(20,000
to
50,000
years
ago)
These

may
now
be

Chengde
The
small
city
of
Chengde
(formerly
known
in
the
west
as
Jehol)
250
km
(155
miles)
northeast
of
Beijing
requires
an
overnight
stay
for
visitors
based
in
the
capital
But
itâs
worthwhile
for
anyone
interested
in
seeing
the
monumental
remains
of
the
Qing
Dynasty
as
well
as
its
most
spectacular
Buddhist
temples
Chengde
became
the
imperial
resort
of
the
Qing
rulers
who
built
royal
city
and
park
here
rivaling
that
of
the
Forbidden
City
and
Summer
Palace
in
Beijing
The
Qing
rulers
never
forgot
their
nomadic
Manchu
roots
and
Emperor
Kangxi
developed
this
remote
valley
in
the
countryside
as
summer
court
and
hunting
ground
in
1703
It
was
here
that
Kangxiâs
grandson
Emperor
Qinalong
received
the
first
official
delegation
from
the
West
ever
to
visit
China
British
team
headed
by
Lord
Macartney
in
1793
And
it
was
here
that
Lord
Macartney
refused
to
kow-tow
(bow)
before
the
emperor
ending
any
hopes
for
peaceful
opening
of
the
door
to
trade
in
the
18th
century
The
Chengde
Summer
Palace
today
is
demarcated
by
wall
91â2
km
(6
miles)
around
and
its
grounds
comprise
the
largest
surviving
imperial
garden
in
China
Among
the
palaces
and
halls
still
in
place
are
the
Front
Palace
where
the
emperors
conducted
official
court
business
and
nine
courtyard
halls
in
plain
rustic
style
Beyond
this
cluster
of
imperial
halls
and
residences
is
large
park
with
lakes
bridges
pavilions
rockeries
and
the
grasslands
and
hills
where
the
court
enjoyed
sports
on
horseback
There
are
copies
of
famous
Chinese
gardens
here
as
well
as
small
temples
and
multilevel
viewing
pavilions
Chengdeâs
other
main
attractions
are
the
temples
in
the
hills
outside
the
park
Many
of
these
âEight
Outer
Templesâ
have
strong
Tibetan
flavor
All
were
built
under
Emperor
Qinalong
between
1713
and
1779
The
Mount
Sumera
Longevity

Happiness
Temple
(Xumifushou

The
Small
Potala
Temple
(Putuozongsheng
Miao)
built
in
1769
is
even
larger
and
more
lavish
covering
22
hectares
(54
acres)
Its
great
red
hall
evokes
the
Potala
Palace
in
Lhasa
and
the
arcades
within
are
filled
with
Buddhist
treasures
including
sensual
figures
related
to
the
esoteric
Buddhism
of
the
Red
Hat
sect
Beyond
these
and
the
other
temples
is

massive

that
can
be
reached
by

from
this
18-m
(60-ft)
natural
tower
of
the
valley
below
the
imperial
park
and
the
surrounding
Buddhist
temples
reveals
the
wealth
and
scale
of
the
Qing
Dynasty
at
its
height
In
1820
this
imperial
summer
villa
was
all
but
abandoned
after

Jiaqing
was
killed
here
by

Less

itself
was

marathons
are
all
regular
activities
and
many
of
Bermudaâs
sporting
associations
hold
invitationals
or
open

you
have
special
sporting
interest
it
would
be
worthwhile

quite
spectacular
Nightlife

is
concentrated

in
the
main

In
the
winter
season
(November
through
March)
nightlife
can
be
much
quieter

takes
up
the
slack
starting

and
other
cultural
events
featuring
performers
and

The
Festival
is
extremely
popular
with

Watching
Ceremonies
Bermuda
has
full
series
of
ceremonial
activities
throughout
the
summer
months
all
based
on
the
traditions
of
British
âpomp
and
circumstance.â
Such
events
as
the
Opening
of
Parliament
the
Beat
Retreat
Ceremony
and
the
âPeppercornâ
Ceremony
are
colorful
exciting
and
rich
in
history
They
also
bring
out
the
whole
community
and
attending
makes
you
feel
as
though
you
are
part
of
Bermudian
society
Shopping
Bermuda
is
not
duty-free
island
In
fact
since
there
is
no
income
tax
for
the
local
population
charging
duty
on
imported
goods
is
one
way
for
the
government
to
raise
funds
Duty
varies
on
the
type
of
goods
but
is
always
included
in
the
price
However
there
is
no
sales
tax
at
all
in
Bermuda
so
here
is
your
opportunity
to
save
little
Tax-free
shops
will
claim
to
save
you
up
to
30
percent
on
prices
back
home
but
this
is
not
universal
It
is
always
important
to
do
some
research
at
home
before
you
arrive
so
that
you
can
compare
prices
Some
goods
are
only
little
cheaper
in
Bermuda
but
you
might
want
ârealâ
bargain
In
many
ways
Bermuda
is
still
vendor
of
fine
British
goods
although
the
range
of
merchandise
is
definitely
expanding
Bermudian
traders
have
always
bought
directly
from
the
manufacturers
rather
than
through
middlemen
which
has
traditionally
resulted
in
cheaper
price
than
you
would
find
at
home
However
government-imposed
import
duty
means
that
prices
might
not
be
as
advantageous
as
they
once
were
The

natural

treasure
trove

Activities
for
Children
Thereâs
nothing
that
young
visitors
like
better
than
sandy
beach
and
the
sea;
they
can
play
for
hours
in
the
shallows
or
build
sandcastles
on
the
shore
Most
of
the
major
resorts
have
clean
safe
beaches
with
good
facilities
Always
remember
to
cover
youngstersâ
skin
with
suitable
sunscreen
and
to
limit
their
time
in
the
sun
for
the
first
few
days:
Bermuda
has
very
clear
air
resulting
in
more
of
the
damaging
rays
reaching
the
surface
Also
make
sure
they
are
well
supervised
whenever
they
are
near
the
water
Some
large
hotel
complexes
will
offer
special
programs
for
children
Some
might
even
have
special
club
where
children
can
make
new
friends
and
spend
the
whole
day
in
pursuit
of
such
activities
as
face
painting
Also
be
aware
that
certain
hotels
in
Bermuda
have
an
adults-only
policy
or
few
facilities
specifically
for
children
Always
research
the
facilities
available
at
any
hotel
before
you
make
reservation

great
fun
and
because
the
hole
is
round
and
small
kids
can
get
pretty
close
to
the
action
Just
make
sure
that
they
donât
become
bait!
Historical
re-enactments
In
Kingâs
Square
in

in
the

Brief
History
This
remote
group
of
islands
remained
unnamed
until
it
was
spotted
by
Spanish
navigator
Juan
BermÃºdez
in
1503
Only
few
years
later
an
Italian
map
showed
âLa
Bermuda.â
It
was
also
called
the
âIsles
of
Devilsâ
because
early
navigators
were
terrified
of
Bermudaâs
reefs
and
celebrated
their
salvation
when
they
had
passed
safely
by
Despite
benign
conditions
and
ample
food
there
were
few
visitors
and
those
who
landed
did
so
usually
because
they
were
shipwrecked
One
was
the
anonymous
sailor
who
carved
the
date
1543
on
rock
on
the
south
coast
now
known
as
Spanish
Rock
He
also
inscribed
cross
and
pair
of
letters
perhaps
his
initials
or
those
of
his
king
The
Sea
Venture
In
1606
James
granted
charter
to
the
Virginia
Company
to
establish
the
first
English
colony
in
America
named
Jamestown
in
the
kingâs
honor
Three
years
later
second
contingent
of
settlers
set
sail
from
Plymouth
under
Admiral
Sir
George
Somers
Less
than
halfway
across
the
Atlantic
the
fleet
ran
into
vicious
storm
The
flagship
vessel
called
Sea
Venture
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
convoy
and
eventually
snagged
on
the
reefs
just
east
of
Bermuda
on
28
July
1609
Miraculously
all
aboard
were
ferried
to
shore
It
turned
out
that
Bermuda
was
an
ideal
place
to
be
stranded
After
less
than
year
Somers
and
his
group
had
built
new
ships
from
local
cedar
and
timber
salvaged
from
the
remains
of
the
Sea
Venture
Leaving
behind
only
two
men
the
Somers
party
resumed
their
journey
westward
and
finally
landed
at
Jamestown
only
to
be
greeted
by
shock:
illness
starvation
and
Indian
attacks
had
drastically
decimated
the
colony
Somers
set
sail
almost
immediately
headed
back
to
Bermuda
He
knew
that
it
could
provide
the
people
of
Jamestown
with
enough
food
to
save
them
from
further
hardship
Unfortunately
he
died
trying
to
organize
the
Bermuda-Jamestown
lifeline
His
body
was
shipped
back
to
England
but
his
heart
was
buried
in
Bermuda
the
colony
he
would
later
be
credited
with
founding
King
James
added
the
name
of
Bermuda
to
the
original
Virginia
Company
Charter
and
in
the
spring
of
1612
more
than
50
colonists
were
sent
out
on
the
Plough
to
join
three
pioneers
who
had
volunteered
to
hold
the
fort
Defenses
were
built
and
the
town
of
St
Georgeâs
was
established
at
the
east
end
of
Bermuda
near
the
spot
where
the
Sea
Venture
castaways
had
first
landed
The
Bermuda
Company
was
then
created
to
administer
the
island
News
of
the
British
settlement
agitated
the
Spanish
After
all
Spaniard
had
discovered
(and
given
his
name
to)
Bermuda
Philip
III
of
Spain
was
urged
by
his
advisors
to
act
immediately
to
force
the
British
out
Two
ships
were
dispatched
with
orders
to
evaluate
the
situation
As
they
approached
the
island
the
small
British
population
created
number
of
ruses
to
convince
the
Spanish
that
Bermuda
was
well
defended;
two
salvos
fired
from
cannon
went
across
the
bay
The
Spanish
fell
for
the
ploy
and
fled
grossly
overestimating
the
strength
of
the
English
garrison
which
couldnât
have
mustered
third
shot
at
that
time
Bermudaâs
Britishness
was
affirmed
Growing
Colony
Progress
was
swift
during
the
first
few
years
of
the
colonyâs
existence
In
1619
the
congregation
of
St
Peterâs
Church
moved
into
permanent
building
and
Bermudaâs
parliament
met
in
an
enclosure
still
visible
amid
the
pews
But
it
was
soon
decided
to
separate
the
secular
from
the
religious
and
new
government
building
went
up
State
House
Bermudaâs
first
stone
structure
is
still
standing
today
in
St
Georgeâs
An
English
surveyor
Richard
Norwood
undertook
study
of
the
terrain
dividing
the
colony
into
the
nine
âtribesâ
that
are
the
parishes
(counties)
of
today
and
the
origin
of
the
numerous
âTribe
Roadsâ
still
to
be
seen
across
the
island
Of
the
nine
parishes
all
but
St
Georgeâs
were
named
after
prominent
shareholders
in
the
original
Bermuda
Company
During
this
period
local
money
was
minted
called
âHogâ
money
after
the
wild
pig
on
the
reverse
side;
it
was
Britainâs
first
colonial
currency
Agriculture
was
to
be
the
economic
base
for
the
new
colony
whose
major
crop
was
tobacco
In
reality
Bermuda
could
never
compete
with
the
crops
produced
in
Virginia
but
it
began
to
develop
plantation
system
including
the
importation
of
slave
labor
The
slaves
were
treated
bit
better
than
were
those
on
islands
farther
south
and
slavery
was
finally
abolished
in
Britain
(and
Bermuda)
in
1834
The
initial
centuries
of
enforced
settlement
followed
by
emancipation
and
the
ensuing
years
of
equality
have
produced
Bermudaâs
modern
biracial
society
When
agriculture
failed
to
be
profitable
the
ingenious
settlers
looked
for
other
ways
to
make
living
Bermuda
sits
astride
the
main
whale
migration
route
and
because
the
motherland
and
other
colonies
demanded
(and
paid
well
for)
the
oil
the
local
population
went
into
the
whaling
business
Once
the
colonists
were
good
enough
seamen
to
land
whales
it
was
perhaps
only
natural
that
they
might
turn
their
skills
to
another
historical
marine
tradition:
piracy
The
practice
evolved
modestly
perhaps
even
legally
from
the
salvaging
(called
âwreckingâ)
of
treasure
found
on
ships
grounded
on
the
local
reefs
From
there
it
was
easy
to
make
the
transition
to
taking
goods
by
subterfuge
or
by
force
Smuggling
was
so
commonplace
that
it
passed
almost
unnoticed
Changing
Loyalties
Isolated
from
London
by
more
than
5,300
km
(3,300
miles)
in
an
age
of
slow
communications
Bermuda
sometimes
found
itself
out
of
step
with
developments
in
the
homeland
In
1649
the
islanders
were
appalled
to
learn
of
the
execution
of
Charles
and
the
proclamation
of
Cromwellâs
Commonwealth
They
later
rejoiced
when
Charles
II
was
restored
to
the
throne
in
1660
Another
era
ended
in
1684
when
the
Bermuda
Company
lost
its
charter
After
five-year
legal
battle
Bermuda
became
British
colony
with
degree
of
self-government
The
authorities
in
London
appointed
Governor
to
act
as
the
crown
representative
(this
is
still
the
system
today)
The
most
difficult
test
of
Bermudaâs
loyalties
came
when
the
American
colonies
rose
in
rebellion
against
George
III
London
forbade
Bermuda
to
trade
with
or
otherwise
support
General
Washingtonâs
revolutionaries
This
was
heartbreaking
decree
for
the
islanders
to
obey
in
light
of
Bermudaâs
close
personal
and
family
ties
with
the
people
of
Virginia
and
other
American
colonies
Commerce
also
provided
strong
rationale
for
helping
the
rebels
for
Bermuda
received
most
of
its
grain
from
the
North
American
colonies
Simply
put
Bermuda
needed
food
and
George
Washington
needed
gunpowder
On
dark
night
in
mid-August
1775
several
boats
sailed
into
the
dark
harbor
of
Tobacco
Bay
near
Fort
St
Catherine
and
in
daring
and
dangerous
raid
stole
100
kegs
of
gunpowder
from
the
main
ordnance
store
Once
safely
on
the
boats
the
ammunition
made
its
way
to
the
rebel
forces
To
this
day
nobody
knows
if
this
was
part
of
an
orchestrated
campaign
or
simply
spur-of-the-moment
action
by
local
sympathizers
But
Bermuda
got
its
grain
The
British
authorities
were
horrified
but
could
find
no
conclusive
proof
of
guilt
The
Tuckers
prominent
family
with
many
connections
to
the
American
revolutionaries
were
the
prime
suspects
Not
all
Bermudians
however
were
sympathetic
to
the
rebel
cause
as
privateers
continued
to
capture
and
ransack
American
ships
Gibraltar
of
the
West
With
the
loss
of
its
naval
bases
in
the
American
colonies
Britain
began
to
appreciate
Bermudaâs
strategic
importance
They
wanted
to
create
âGibraltar
of
the
Westâ
and
set
about
building
large
naval
dockyard
on
Ireland
Island
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
archipelago
from
the
main
population
center
of
St
Georgeâs
The
addition
of
this
important
facility
shifted
the
center
of
communications
in
the
colony
prompting
authorities
to
transfer
the
capital
from
St
Georgeâs
to
the
hitherto
undistinguished
village
of
Hamilton
Traditionalists
were
furious
Starting
in
1824
Britain
sent
convicts
to
Bermuda
to
supplement
the
slave
labor
working
on
the
dockyard
project
At
any
given
time
there
were
well
over
1,000
prisoners
employed
in
the
development
of
the
outpostâs
military
potential
Yellow
fever
dysentery
and
scurvy
killed
sizable
proportion
of
these
unfortunates
who
were
crammed
into
filthy
floating
prisons
(called
âhulksâ)
during
the
hours
they
werenât
working
These
hulks
were
used
until
1863
Bermuda
and
the
US
Civil
War
Slavery
had
been
abolished
in
Bermuda
more
than
quarter-century
before
the
outbreak
of
the
American
Civil
War
yet
islandersâ
sympathies
lay
with
the
South
Although
Britain
remained
officially
neutral
and
British
subjects
were
forbidden
from
taking
part
in
the
hostilities
the
Bermudians
pitched
in
to
help
supply
British
arms
and
goods
to
the
Confederate
cause
against
the
Union
forces
St
Georgeâs
Harbour
and
Pennoâs
Wharf
were
working
at
full
capacity
to
unload
cargoes
that
were
then
transferred
onto
blockade-runners
These
long
slim
vessels
were
specially
designed
to
outrun
the
Union
navyâs
picket
ships
They
made
their
way
to
Wilmington
North
Carolina
the
closest
Confederate
port
to
Bermuda
Here
they
would
take
on
new
cargo
of
cottonÂ âÂ a
most
profitable
ballast
that
increased
in
value
tenfold
by
the
time
it
was
delivered
to
buyers
in
Britain
St
Georgeâs
boomed
during
the
Civil
War;
the
town
seethed
with
sailors
speculators
Confederate
agents
and
Union
spies
When
General
Lee
laid
down
his
sword
in
1865
it
was
as
if
Bermuda
too
had
lost
war
In
the
years
that
followed
Bermudaâs
fortunes
picked
up
as
the
first
steamships
began
to
arrive
on
regular
basis
In
1883
Princess
Louise
(daughter
of
Queen
Victoria)
arrived
on
lengthy
visit
en
route
to
her
new
home
farther
north
as
the
wife
of
the
Governor
General
of
Canada
She
extolled
Bermuda
to
those
in
her
upper-class
English
circles
and
wealthy
tourists
began
to
arrive
soon
thereafter
By
the
turn
of
the
century
Bermuda
was
well-known
winter
destination
for
visitors
from
the
US
and
Canada
as
well
as
Britain
The
Princess
Hotel
was
opened
in
Hamilton
in
1885
to
commemorate
the
visit
Three
More
Wars
At
the
turn
of
the
twentieth
century
the
Boer
War
(the
struggle
between
British
and
Dutch
settlers
in
South
Africa)
sent
shock
waves
as
far
as
Bermuda
Thousands
of
Boer
prisoners
were
shipped
to
the
colony
and
prison
camps
were
established
on
half-a-dozen
islands
in
Great
Sound
After
the
Boers
lost
the
war
many
of
the
prisoners
chose
to
remain
in
Bermuda
rather
than
accept
British
South
Africa
During
World
War
I
Bermudian
volunteers
fought
in
France
while
others
joined
resident
British
forces
in
defending
the
islands
German
submarines
aggravated
the
supply
problem
and
threatened
ships
stopping
in
the
islands
to
refuel
for
the
remainder
of
the
Atlantic
crossing
When
the
Americans
entered
the
conflict
Whiteâs
Island
just
opposite
the
Hamilton
waterfront
was
leased
to
the
US
government
It
was
small-scale
preview
of
the
American
military
presence
that
would
be
established
in
World
War
II
Between
the
two
world
wars
tourism
became
prime
economic
factor
and
luxury
cruise
liners
began
regular
runs
between
New
York
and
Bermuda
during
the
1920s
Resort
hotels
were
built
to
attract
Americans
escaping
the
northern
winter
(and
the
Prohibition
laws
against
alcoholic
beverages)
When
war
broke
out
in
Europe
in
1939
Bermudaâs
growing
tourist
industry
all
but
collapsed
The
ships
were
commandeered
to
carry
troops
or
become
floating
hospitals
and
the
waters
around
the
islands
were
infested
with
German
submarines
Bermuda
played
an
important
role
in
intelligence
In
the
basements
of
the
Princess
and
Bermudiana
hotels
more
than
thousand
British
experts
analyzed
communications
intercepted
between
the
western
hemisphere
and
Europe
Mail
quietly
removed
from
refueling
ships
and
planes
was
steamed
open
and
tested
for
microdots
and
invisible
codes
an
important
contribution
to
the
struggle
against
Axis
spying
activity
The
big
hotels
stayed
in
business
by
serving
as
billets
for
servicemen
and
civilian
war
workers
Just
as
the
first
British
M15
intelligence
operatives
were
arriving
in
Hamilton
in
August
1940
the
Lend-Lease
Act
was
negotiated
between
Britain
and
the
US
Under
99-year
lease
the
US
acquired
about
one-tenth
of
the
land
area
of
Bermuda
for
the
development
of
naval
and
air
bases
modernizing
the
defenses
of
Britainâs
âGibraltar
of
the
West.â
Changing
Times
In
the
years
after
World
War
II
the
centuries-old
links
with
Britain
began
to
change
The
âImperialâ
coffers
were
empty
the
empire
swiftly
began
to
contract
and
British
military
forces
were
pulled
out
of
Bermuda
after
174
years
Social
changes
also
began
to
revolutionize
the
old
way
of
life
The
motor
car
was
introduced
bringing
about
the
demise
of
the
horse-drawn
carriage
and
eventually
causing
the
bankruptcy
of
the
new
Bermuda
Railway
in
1947
The
1950s
saw
racial
segregation
end
in
the
major
hotels
and
restaurants
(although
schools
were
not
integrated
until
1971)
In
1968
new
constitution
was
adopted
to
make
self-government
more
representative
and
effective;
elections
were
won
by
the
United
Bermuda
Party
Then
suddenly
in
1970
the
colony
was
expelled
from
the
âSterling
area,â
and
Bermuda
chose
to
ally
its
currency
to
the
US
dollar
These
abrupt
and
far-reaching
changes
on
an
island
proud
of
its
traditional
ways
brought
strain
and
conflict
Riots
broke
out
in
1968
and
British
troops
had
to
be
called
in
to
restore
order
Five
years
later
the
governor
Sir
Richard
Sharples
and
his
aide
were
assassinated
When
the
alleged
assassins
were
executed
in
1977
more
riots
ensued
However
Bermuda
pulled
back
from
the
brink
of
social
chaos
and
began
to
return
to
its
peaceful
and
law-abiding
ways
With
progressive
taxation
for
its
residents
the
colony
enjoyed
one
of
the
highest
standards
of
living
in
the
world
Where
whaling
and
piracy
were
once
important
industries
the
colony
now
looked
to
the
less
exciting
but
more
predictable
earnings
from
tourism
insurance
and
banking
enterprises
In
the
1970s
the
number
of
so-called
exempt
companies
more
than
doubled
and
they
now
compete
with
tourism
as
the
major
contributor
to
Bermudaâs
balance-of-paymentsâ
surplus
The
political
status
quo
under
the
United
Bermuda
Party
continued
until
November
1998
when
the
PLP
(Progressive
Labour
Party)
won
an
unexpected
landslide
victory
in
the
general
elections
This
not
only
surprised
the
old
school
but
ushered
in
new
era
full
of
opportunity
for
development
as
the
island
keeps
up
with
rapidly
changing
world
Challenges
include
environmental
and
housing
issues
as
well
as
problems
of
unemployment
unknown
in
modern
Bermuda
until
the
final
years
of
the
20th
century
Positive
long-term
solutions
will
ensure
that
Bermuda
continues
to
enjoy
the
wealth
security
and
comfort
it
has
created
for
itself
Brief
History
Beijing
has
frequently
been
at
the
center
of
Chinese
history
from
the
rise
and
fall
of
dynasties
to
the
recent
triumphs
and
tragedies
at
Tiananmen
Square
Each
great
phase
left
visible
marks
on
Beijing
and
the
capital
is
virtual
museum
devoted
to
the
worldâs
oldest
continuous
civilization
Peking
Man
The
skull
and
bones
of
Chinaâs
oldest
prehistoric
resident
Peking
Man
were
discovered
50
km
(30
miles)
southwest
of
Beijing
in
1929
This
excavation
at
Zhoukoudian
estimated
to
be
500,000â690,000
years
old
constituted
one
of
the
major
chapters
in
modern
paleontology
since
it
was
the
first
evidence
that
early
man
(Homo
erectus)
might
have
evolved
in
Asia
as
well
as
Africa
The
Peking
Man
Caves
and
Museum
at
Zhoukoudian
are
still
major
Beijing
tourist
site
although
many
of
the
important
fossils
are
in
collections
outside
China
Within
Beijing
itself
there
was
no
evidence
of
prehistoric
settlement
until
the
accidental
discovery
in
1996
of
Stone
Age
village
barely
km
(half
mile)
from
the
Forbidden
City
and
Tiananmen
Square
The
stone
implements
and
human
fossils
at
this
site
beneath
the
new
Oriental
Plaza
office
and
shopping
complex
are
now
on
public
view
in
basement
gallery
They
push
the
known
human
settlement
of
central
Beijing
back
to
20,000
b.c
Capital
of
the
Khans
There
are
records
of
town
existing
at
Beijing
as
early
as
the
Western
Zhou
Dynasty
(1100â771
b.c.)
but
the
growth
of
the
city
did
not
begin
until
the
end
of
the
Tang
Dynasty
(a.d
618â907)
Invaders
from
the
north
the
Khitan
swept
down
and
made
Beijing
their
secondary
capital
from
which
they
controlled
much
of
northern
China
This
period
was
known
as
the
Liao
Dynasty
(a.d
916â1125)
but
there
are
almost
no
traces
of
it
in
Beijing
today
The
Liao
capital
at
Beijing
then
known
as
Yanjing
occupied
the
southeast
region
of
what
is
the
modern
capital
today
with
the
Fayuan
Temple
the
only
surviving
monument
Another
swarm
of
nomadic
invaders
eventually
routed
the
Khitan
establishing
the
capital
of
the
Jin
Dynasty
(1115â1234)
on
the
outskirts
of
Beijing
(which
they
renamed
Zhongdu
or
Central
Capital)
The
Jin
capital
was
in
turn
completely
razed
by
fresh
batch
of
northern
nomadic
usurpers
They
were
the
MongolsÂ âÂ led
by
Genghis
KhanÂ âÂ who
would
leave
more
lasting
and
extensive
mark
on
Beijing
and
all
of
China
Genghis
Khan
laid
the
groundwork
gradually
uniting
all
China
under
his
rule
and
leaving
it
to
his
famous
grandson
Kublai
Khan
to
secure
the
Yuan
Dynasty
(1279â1368)
Kublai
Khan
erected
his
own
capital
in
1279
on
the
shores
of
Beijingâs
Beihai
Lake
where
some
of
his
imperial
treasures
remain
on
display
today
It
was
to
these
same
shores
that
Marco
Polo
claimed
to
have
journeyed
at
the
end
of
the
13th
century
where
he
won
the
support
of
Kublai
Khan
He
made
Beijing
then
known
as
Khanbaliq
(Khanâs
Town)
or
Dadu
(Great
Capital)
the
base
for
his
extensive
travels
in
China
as
emissary
of
the
Khan
Of
the
13th-century
capital
Marco
Polo
wrote
that
âthe
whole
interior
of
the
city
is
laid
out
in
squares
like
chessboard
with
such
masterly
precision
that
no
description
can
do
justice
to
itâÂ âÂ a
pattern
Beijing
retains
to
this
day
The
Ming
Period
The
Mongol
rulers
of
the
Yuan
Dynasty
were
eventually
undone
by
indigenous
Chinese
rebels
who
established
one
of
the
most
renowned
of
all
imperial
lines
the
Ming
Dynasty
(1368â1644)
The
capital
was
again
razed
and
rebuilt
and
Ming
Emperor
Yongle
gave
it
new
name
that
would
stick:
Beijing
(Northern
Capital)
By
1420
he
had
finished
constructing
the
cityâs
most
famous
surviving
monument
the
Forbidden
City
This
was
accompanied
by
other
monumental
projects
The
Bell
Tower
the
Drum
Tower
and
above
all
the
graceful
Temple
of
Heaven
were
built
in
the
early
15th
century
Many
of
Beijingâs
major
temples
also
date
from
the
Ming
Dynasty
The
Ming
rulers
cautiously
welcomed
few
Catholic
missionaries
from
Europe
to
Beijing
In
the
17th
century
the
Jesuits
headed
by
Matteo
Ricci
had
profound
influence
not
so
much
on
Chinese
religion
(they
made
few
converts
among
Beijingers)
as
on
science
mathematics
astronomy
art
medicine
and
other
forms
of
knowledge
that
had
never
before
been
infused
with
Western
ideas
in
China
Perhaps
the
greatest
project
of
the
Ming
however
was
the
restoration
and
extension
of
the
Great
Wall
north
of
Beijing
For
the
first
time
brick
was
used
to
finish
these
magnificent
fortifications
It
is
the
Ming
Dynasty
Great
Wall
that
millions
visit
today
at
Beijing
The
Qing
Period
The
Ming
rulers
were
understandably
nervous
about
yet
another
invasion
from
the
north
and
took
defensive
measures
by
extending
the
Great
Wall
They
were
nonetheless
undone
by
precisely
what
they
feared
most:
northern
invaders
This
time
the
conquerors
were
the
Manchus
who
established
dynasty
that
proved
as
long-lived
and
as
glorious
as
the
Ming
The
Manchu
rulers
of
the
Qing
Dynasty
(1644â1911)
were
wise
enough
to
adopt
Chinese
ways
They
kept
the
capital
at
Beijing
but
unlike
preceding
dynasties
did
not
raze
it
Instead
the
Manchus
preserved
and
restored
Chinaâs
past
The
Forbidden
City
the
Temple
of
Heaven
and
Beihai
Lake
were
maintained
as
imperial
strongholds
Old
temples
were
renovated
and
the
hutong
neighborhoods
of
courtyard
mansions
were
developed
Two
of
the
greatest
Qing
emperors
Kangxi
and
his
grandson
Qianlong
maintained
the
Ming
Tombs
and
saw
to
the
building
of
the
Summer
Palace
while
the
last
great
imperial
ruler
of
China
the
Empress
Dowager
Cixi
kept
the
Summer
Palace
and
the
Forbidden
City
in
splendid
condition
into
the
early
20th
century
These
and
most
other
historic
sites
at
Beijing
were
either
preserved
or
created
by
the
Qing
rulers
including
their
own
imperial
tombs
which
rival
those
of
the
Ming
The
Qing
Dynasty
is
also
celebrated
for
its
elaboration
of
the
artistic
traditions
it
inherited
from
the
Ming
Dynasty
What
we
know
as
Peking-style
opera
and
still
see
performed
today
in
the
capital
became
formalized
under
the
Qing
although
its
roots
(and
costumes)
go
back
to
Ming
and
earlier
eras
The
Ming
were
also
noted
for
their
superb
ink
paintings
cloisonnÃ©
enamel
work
furniture
design
and
lacquerwareÂ âÂ but
above
all
for
their
porcelains
of
the
âfive-colorsâ
and
âblue-and-whiteâ
schools
At
the
end
of
the
Ming
these
porcelains
with
landscape
and
garden
designs
became
all
the
rage
in
Europe
where
imitation
âChineseâ
pottery
began
to
be
produced
The
Qing
continued
these
artistic
traditions
adding
increasingly
rich
and
dense
ornamentation
and
applying
new
colors
many
of
them
clashing
or
gaudy
This
absorption
in
overly
elaborate
artwork
combined
with
heavy
demands
for
imperial
luxuries
finally
coincided
with
decline
in
the
dynasty
itself
In
the
19th
century
the
Qing
rulers
faced
new
legion
of
invaders
not
from
the
north
(as
in
the
past)
but
from
the
West
and
they
were
unable
to
resist
the
tide
Since
the
time
of
the
First
Opium
War
(1839â1842)
Western
nations
had
been
pushing
China
to
open
its
doors
to
foreign
trade
In
1860
during
the
Second
Opium
War
British
and
French
troops
forcibly
occupied
Beijing
and
exacted
treaty
rights
Foreign
delegations
businesses
and
missionaries
poured
into
the
capital
taking
up
residence
in
the
Legation
Quarter
located
just
southeast
of
the
Forbidden
City
In
1900
the
Legation
Quarter
was
attacked
by
the
Boxers
radical
nationalist
group
that
had
the
tacit
support
of
the
Qing
court
In
retaliation
for
this
unsuccessful
attempt
to
expel
Westerners
from
Beijing
military
forces
representing
the
eight
foreign
nations
resident
in
the
capital
went
on
rampage
destroying
the
national
library
and
even
setting
fire
to
the
Summer
Palace
Thereafter
the
Legation
Quarter
exercised
complete
control
over
its
own
affairs
becoming
its
own
foreign
city
within
the
city
of
Beijing
Many
of
the
European-style
embassy
buildings
offices
banks
hotels
and
mansions
of
the
period
have
survived
although
all
have
been
converted
to
other
uses
since
the
revolution
of
1949
Republicans
and
Warlords
Chinaâs
history
of
imperial
rule
is
far
older
than
Beijingâs
reign
as
capital
but
it
was
at
Beijing
that
the
last
of
Chinaâs
dynasties
was
destined
to
fall
The
Qing
rulers
were
overthrown
in
1911
and
the
Republic
of
China
led
by
Sun
Yat-sen
was
declared
period
of
regional
civil
wars
and
power
struggles
among
rival
warlords
ensued
Students
used
Tiananmen
Square
in
1919
as
the
stage
for
their
protests
against
post-World
War
âunequal
treatiesâ
that
favored
Japan
patriotic
demonstration
known
as
the
May
the
Fourth
Movement
In
1928
Beijing
was
re-established
as
the
national
capital
under
the
Guomindang
(Nationalist
Party)
led
by
Chiang
Kai-Shek
For
the
first
time
in
Beijing
history
the
imperial
strongholds
from
the
Forbidden
City
to
the
Temple
of
Heaven
were
no
longer
forbidden
to
Chinaâs
masses
Progress
and
freedom
were
short-lived
in
Beijing
Japan
invaded
northern
China
on
the
eve
of
World
War
II
seizing
the
capital
in
1937
after
valiant
battle
at
the
Marco
Polo
Bridge
(one
of
many
new
monuments
added
to
Beijing
in
the
20th
century)
The
Japanese
occupied
Beijing
until
the
warâs
end
in
1945
Nanjing
became
Chinaâs
new
capital
under
the
ruling
Nationalist
Party
but
revolutionary
change
was
in
the
air
Communists
and
Capitalists
On
October
1949
new
nationÂ âÂ the
Peopleâs
Republic
of
ChinaÂ âÂ was
declared
from
the
podium
facing
Tiananmen
Square
and
Beijing
was
again
to
serve
as
Chinaâs
capital
This
new
China
was
indeed
radically
new
Led
by
Chairman
Mao
Zedong
it
was
the
largest
communist
state
in
the
world
and
it
would
soon
begin
its
own
program
to
reverse
and
destroy
the
âfeudalâ
legacy
of
thousands
of
years
of
imperial
rule
The
Chinese
Communist
party
first
initiated
popular
program
of
reconstruction
to
transform
and
modernize
the
nation
In
Beijing
the
ancient
city
walls
were
pulled
down
and
the
city
moat
was
filled
in
Only
few
of
the
venerable
city
gates
and
towers
remain
standing
today
Chinaâs
first
subway
system
now
makes
loop
that
retraces
the
foundations
of
the
city
walls
with
the
subway
stops
named
for
the
ancient
city
gates
Tiananmen
Square
was
substantially
enlarged
Changâan
Avenue
widened
the
Great
Hall
of
the
People
built
the
Museum
of
History
and
the
Museum
of
the
Revolution
openedÂ âÂ all
in
the
1950s
Old
neighborhoods
began
to
be
replaced
by
modern
brick-and-concrete
highrises
Beijing
became
its
own
powerful
municipality
(not
part
of
any
province)
the
seat
of
the
new
revolutionary
government
for
the
nation
The
Cultural
Revolution
(1966â1976)
closed
Beijingâs
doors
to
the
outside
world
Mao
and
his
most
radical
followers
shut
down
the
nationâs
institutions
and
went
on
witch
hunt
for
those
alleged
to
harbor
politically
incorrect
thoughts
behaviors
or
backgrounds
(which
at
times
seemed
to
include
anyone
not
waving
Maoâs
Little
Red
Book)
Many
of
Beijingâs
temples
and
historic
sites
were
not
only
closed
but
severely
damaged
all
in
the
name
of
making
complete
break
with
the
feudal
superstitious
past
Renovations
as
result
of
this
era
of
cultural
destruction
are
not
yet
complete
and
some
ancient
sites
have
never
reopened
Nevertheless
after
the
death
of
Chairman
Mao
(whose
mausoleum
on
Tiananmen
Square
has
become
much-visited
modern
monument
to
Chinaâs
modern
âemperorâ)
Beijing
entered
period
of
liberal
economic
reform
that
has
again
transformed
the
capital
Under
âsupreme
leaderâ
Deng
Xiaoping
China
opened
its
doors
to
Western
investment
and
culture
in
the
1980s
By
the
time
of
Dengâs
death
in
1997
Beijing
was
firmly
reshaping
itself
as
an
international
capital
in
the
Western
mode
complete
with
expressways
skyscrapers
shopping
plazas
luxury
hotel
chains
rock
concerts
and
state-of-the-art
computer
technologiesÂ âÂ not
to
mention
rising
crime
rates
soaring
pollution
levels
increasing
unemployment
and
income
disparities
sharp
enough
to
make
Mao
turn
over
in
his
crypt
The
skyline
of
the
capital
rises
higher
and
higher
each
year
glass
and
steel
replace
brick
and
mud
in
the
old
courtyards
cars
replace
carts
in
the
streets
and
computers
replace
abacuses
in
the
schools
Todayâs
Beijing
would
seem
to
have
little
in
common
with
the
Beihai
lakeshore
of
Kublai
Khan
and
Marco
Polo
the
Forbidden
City
of
the
Ming
the
Summer
Palace
of
the
Qing
the
Temple
of
Confucius
or
even
the
patriotic
tomb
of
Chairman
Mao
But
Chinaâs
capital
has
not
escaped
the
history
that
shaped
it
be
it
ancient
or
modern
Visitors
can
still
see
both
today
Where
to
Go
Bali
is
not
large
island:
you
can
easily
get
to
any
place
on
Bali
in
several
hours
But
to
the
Balinese
the
island
is
their
universeâa
world
unto
itself
You
will
cut
traveling
time
and
get
to
know
different
areas
of
Bali
in
depth
if
you
make
overnight
stays
or
visits
of
few
days
in
each
of
the
islandâs
regions
Donât
expectâand
donât
even
tryâto
rush
around
seeing
all
the
temples
and
other
cultural
attractions
on
the
island
or
all
those
mentioned
in
this
section
The
island
scenery
and
fleeting
glimpses
of
everyday
life
are
just
as
rewarding
Best
of
all
is
to
turn
corner
and
find
procession
perhaps
the
whole
population
of
village
dressed
in
their
best
and
blocking
the
road
Balinese
temples
palaces
and
other
buildings
however
exotic
or
exquisite
only
really
come
to
life
when
filled
with
ceremonies
and
the
bustle
of
festivals
We
have
selected
some
of
the
most
interesting
and
important
attractions
but
to
truly
appreciate
and
absorb
what
you
see
we
suggest
that
you
take
few
at
time
Start
as
soon
after
dawn
as
possible
when
itâs
cool
and
the
light
is
better
for
photography
prompt
start
also
gives
you
extra
time
to
reach
the
more
remote
areas
The
Southern
Resorts
Most
of
Baliâs
tourism
is
concentrated
in
tiny
fraction
of
the
island
with
the
vast
majority
of
visitors
heading
for
the
âbig
threeâ
beaches
namely
Sanur
Kuta
and
Nusa
Dua
all
within
short
drive
of
the
airport
Some
stretches
of
sand
are
so
magnificent
and
the
water
so
warm
itâs
hard
to
believe
that
they
were
ignored
for
so
long
by
the
Balinese
people
who
have
traditionally
turned
away
from
the
sea
Now
visitors
come
in
the
millions
from
all
over
the
world
with
little
in
mind
but
sun
sand
warm
seas
and
watersports
Sanur
Southeast
of
Denpasar
Baliâs
capital
Sanur
is
where
the
first
modern
tourist
hotel
10
stories
high
was
built
in
the
1960s
Fortunately
no
other
high-rise
hotels
have
been
built
on
Baliâthe
authorities
decreed
that
in
the
future
no
building
should
be
higher
than
palm
tree
In
atmosphere
Sanur
falls
somewhere
between
the
brash
noisy
Kuta
and
secluded
pricey
Nusa
Dua
Half-hidden
by
tropical
gardens
and
foliage
many
of
Sanurâs
hotels
are
small
in
scale
and
face
the
pleasant
sandy
beach
The
water
is
generally
calm
protected
from
waves
and
undercurrents
by
an
outlying
coral
reef
At
high
tide
the
swimming
is
wonderful
but
at
low
tide
the
water
dips
to
knee
or
waist
level
and
wading
is
the
only
activity
possible
Beyond
the
reef
are
massive
pounding
waves
challenge
for
experienced
surfers
Just
inland
parallel
to
the
beach
the
town
of
Sanur
looks
at
first
like
nothing
more
than
long
strip
of
souvenir
shops
clothing
boutiques
and
restaurants
But
take
walk
along
some
of
the
lanes
leading
off
the
main
road
Jalan
Tanjung
Sari
or
beyond
the
impatient
traffic
of
the
bypass
(Jalan
Bypass)
and
youâll
find
traditional
life
still
going
on
as
if
tourism
had
never
happened
Many
small
Indonesian
and
seafood
restaurants
on
the
street
are
pleasant;
one
or
two
are
outstanding
Sanur
hotels
provide
the
best
top-bracket
dining
Only
short
walk
north
along
the
shore
from
the
ten-story
Grand
Bali
Beach
Hotel
is
the
Le
Mayeur
Museum
once
the
house
of
the
Belgian
painter
Adrien
Jean
Le
Mayeur
He
came
to
Bali
in
1932
and
stayed
to
marry
the
beautiful
Ni
Pollok
who
had
been
well-known
legong
dancer
(see
pageÂ 88)
before
retiring
(at
14!)
to
teach
dance
In
its
day
the
garden
with
its
ponds
and
statues
was
open
on
the
seaward
side;
now
it
is
fully
enclosed
The
outside
of
the
house
is
covered
with
stone
carvings
while
the
interior
is
gallery
of
sculpture
collected
by
Le
Mayeur
The
walls
are
hung
with
his
own
paintings:
European
landscapes
Balinese
scenes
and
studies
of
dancers
including
Ni
Pollok
When
Le
Mayeur
died
in
1958
the
house
was
turned
into
museum
that
his
widow
ran
until
her
death
in
1985
Near
the
small
harbor
at
this
end
of
Sanur
Beach
you
can
find
motorized
prahu
(outrigger
boats)
to
take
you
to
Nusa
Lembongan
an
island
17Â km
(11Â miles)
offshore
to
the
east
which
is
noted
for
its
good
surfing
and
snorkeling
At
the
southern
end
of
Sanur
Beach
near
the
Sanur
Beach
Hotel
the
signs
point
to
Pura
Belanjong
Itâs
only
short
walk
but
few
people
find
their
way
to
this
old
temple
deserted
unless
thereâs
ceremony
stone
pillar
now
set
in
pit
and
protected
by
railings
bears
an
inscription
said
to
date
from
a.d.Â 913
but
as
it
is
normally
wrapped
in
cloth
youâre
unlikely
to
see
it
Kuta
The
most
famous
stretch
of
beach
in
Bali
forms
the
western
shore
of
narrow
neck
of
land
just
north
of
the
airport
After
travelers
in
the
1960s
discovered
that
they
could
enjoy
back-to-nature
existence
here
at
minimal
cost
they
gathered
in
ever-increasing
numbers
Tales
were
told
in
Australia
about
the
âperfect
wave,â
and
Kuta
became
the
dream
destination
for
every
surfer
Once
poor
fishing
village
and
wasteland
believed
to
be
inhabited
by
bad
spirits
by
the
1980s
it
was
transformed
into
frenetic
scene
fueled
by
plenty
of
alcohol
and
for
while
illegal
drugs
The
height
limit
was
virtually
the
only
regulation
applied
to
building
and
sprawling
shantytown
soon
sprang
up
Theft
and
prostitution
(chiefly
blamed
on
incomers
from
the
other
islands)
looked
as
if
they
were
becoming
endemic
On
and
off
the
beach
every
foreigner
was
plagued
by
hawkers
as
adhesive
as
bush
flies
Eventually
voices
were
heard
at
banjar
meetings
urging
clean-up
and
the
raising
of
standards
Today
Kuta
has
gone
long
way
toward
putting
its
house
right
Drugs
have
largely
disappeared
and
crime
rates
are
down
although
you
still
need
to
beware
of
pickpockets
and
shouldnât
leave
property
unguarded
Traffic
however
remains
Kutaâs
nightmare
Kuta
and
its
progressively
upscale
neighbors
to
the
north
Legian
Seminyak
and
Kerobokan
(as
well
as
Tuban
to
the
south)
provide
an
enormous
selection
of
hotels
restaurants
pubs
and
shopping
choices
In
all
price
ranges
youâll
find
some
of
the
best
Italian
French
Vegetarian
Asian
and
Mexican
restaurants
on
the
island
as
well
as
some
of
the
best
shops
for
crafts
from
other
islands
fashion
locally
produced
ikat
cloth
and
casual
Bali-style
beach
clothing
In
keeping
with
its
new
image
Kuta
has
begun
to
acquire
the
trappings
of
modern
town
in
the
form
of
the
multi-story
Kuta
Center
and
Galleria
shopping
and
leisure
complexes
Every
street
and
gang
(alley)
is
lined
with
moneychangers
clothing
shops
car
and
bike
rental
agencies
all
sorts
of
accommodations
and
numerous
bars
and
restaurants
The
beach
is
the
real
reason
to
be
here
and
even
though
you
wonât
escape
the
hawkers
itâs
rest
cure
after
the
bustle
of
the
town
Swim
only
between
the
flags
where
Australian-style
lifeguards
keep
watch:
the
undertow
and
currents
can
be
hazardous
Surf
shops
abound
Towards
sunset
golden
light
reflects
off
the
sea
and
local
people
come
out
to
stroll
or
paddle
in
the
shallows
Young
men
play
soccer
on
the
sand
or
join
the
tourists
in
volleyball
game
while
the
eager
beach
masseuses
rustle
up
new
wave
of
business
At
nightfall
new
choices
beckon
You
can
inspect
Baliâs
selection
of
shops
pick
restaurant
go
on
pub
crawl
or
see
movie
and
wait
for
midnight
when
the
discos
get
into
gear
Kutaâs
Neighbors
Kuta
Beach
can
mean
the
small
area
around
the
original
village
or
the
whole
coast
stretching
from
the
airport
north
to
Legian
and
beyond
Kutaâs
neighbors
are
developing
separate
identities
Tuban
Beach
to
the
south
has
half
dozen
big
hotels
and
waterpark
with
waterslides
and
swimming
pool
attracting
families
and
groups
The
beach
has
calmer
water
and
streets
are
quieter;
however
sea
pollution
can
sometimes
be
problem
here
Adjoining
Kuta
to
the
north
Legian
at
first
seems
like
more
of
the
same
with
big
concentration
of
places
to
eat
drink
dance
and
sleep
along
Jalan
Melasti
Jalan
Padma
and
Jalan
Legian
itself
Sunrise
is
an
idyllic
time
to
be
on
Legian
Beach
Surfers
are
out
at
the
first
light
of
dawn
and
runners
pace
the
waterâs
edge
The
farther
north
you
go
the
less
congested
the
streets
and
the
beach
until
you
can
almost
find
yourself
standing
alone
on
the
broad
sands
of
Seminyak
North
again
surfers
find
their
way
to
Canggu
Beach
by
way
of
narrow
tracks
through
the
rice
fields
The
final
kilometer
or
so
is
passable
only
by
motorcycle
or
on
foot
Bukit
Badung
Referred
to
simply
as
Bukit
(or
âthe
hillâ)
by
the
Balinese
the
peninsula
south
of
the
airport
is
almost
separate
island
Most
of
it
is
windswept
limestone
plateau
entirely
unlike
the
rest
of
southern
Bali
Too
dry
for
rice
its
rocky
soil
is
used
to
grow
beans
cassava
and
peanuts
In
the
past
few
people
lived
here
and
the
only
reason
they
might
visit
was
to
worship
at
one
of
the
temples
and
particularly
at
Uluwatu
on
the
cliffs
at
the
western
tip
In
the
1980s
the
government
decided
to
develop
an
exclusive
resort
zone
at
Nusa
Dua
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
Bukit
peninsula
Another
site

Jimbaran
Its

At

The
name
meaning
âtwo
islands,â
refers
to
two
knobs
of
land
sticking
out
from
the
coast
in
the
middle
of
the
reserve
They
are
not
true
islands

are
each
connected
by
narrow
neck

As
at

when

out
the

is
too
low
for

most
Nusa

vast

Once

All
the

youâll
be

Denpasar
The
capital
of
Bali
since
the
end
of
World
WarÂ II
Denpasar
was
still
small
market
town
only
20Â years
ago
Now
ten
times
the
size
fueled
by
prosperity
from
the
tourism
boom
with
all
the
government
institutions
and
buildings
to
match
its
status
itâs
noisy
polluted
urban
sprawl
Rush
hour
lasts
most
of
the
day
and
when
traffic
lights
change
thereâs
cavalry
charge
of
motorcycles
and
scooters
In
the
middle
of
it
all
the
better-off
live
in
traditional
family
compoundsÂ âÂ extra-high
walls
are
the
main
concession
to
this
kind
of
life
Those
who
have
had
to
adapt
to
apartment
living
in
the
city
can
still
have
their
family
templeÂ âÂ on

The
most
prominent
central
landmark
is
big
grey
statue
of
the
four-faced
Hindu
god
Catur
Muka
looking
each

at
the

The

West
of

Jalan
Gaja

About
1Â km

to
the
local

At

youâll
find
the
Bali

(Museum

This
interesting

rather
antiquated
museum
of
ethnography

and
art
was
created
by
the
Dutch
in
1910
Three
of
the
four
museum
buildings
(fascinating
in
themselves)
represent
different
styles
of

The
main

contains
historical
artifacts
ranging
from
2,200-year-old
stone
sarcophagus
to
photographs
of
the
1906

upstairs
is
collection
of
day-to-day

items
The

in
the
Singaraja
style
displays
antique
Balinese
textiles;
the
Second
Pavilion
in
the
18th
century
Karangasaem
style
houses
religious

objects;
the
Third

in
the
style
of
the
Tabanan

displays
artifacts
used

From
Denpasar
to
Ubud:
The
Craft
Villages
When
the
rajas
ruled
Bali
they
organized
the
various
crafts
on
village
basis
One
village
would
specialize
in
wood-carving
another
in
weaving
and
third
in
basketry
Passed
down
through
each
family
today
those
same
skills
are
still
practiced
in
the
same
communities
Along
the
busy
road
north
from
Denpasar
to
Ubud
the
various
craft
villages
have
virtually
merged
into
each
other
but
you
can
tell
which
one
youâre
in
by
their
products
noisy

of
Batubulan
(moonstone)
specializes
in

Youâll
see
them
on

along
the
main
street
and
also
in
some
of
Baliâs
hotels
Then
comes
Bona
center
of
basketry
which
also
bills
itself
as
the
home
of
the
kecak
dance
The
regular
performances
here
are
certainly
more
complete
than
most
versions
Back

Vast
numbers
of
shops

line
the

Unless

has

just
stop
anywhere
and
look
inside
without
buying
right
away
Then
investigate
the
side
streets
Away
from

you
might
find
an
entire

Ubud
Once
magnet
for
foreign
artists
and
still
home
to
some
Ubud
and
the
cluster
of

around
it
form
the
cultural
and
artistic
focus
of
Bali
An
increasing
number
of
visitors
come
on
day
trips
from
the
coastal
resorts
but
better
plan
is
to
stay
overnight
or
longer
Thereâs
wide
choice
of
accommodations
ranging
from
cheap
homestays
and
charming
middle
range
hotels
to
high-priced
luxury
hideaways
in
the
countryside
just
outside
Ubud
Day
trippers
only
get
to
see
the
commercialism
and
chaos
in
Ubudâs
main
streets
Just
short
walk
away
however
youâre
among
the
green
peaceful
rice
terraces
and
jungle-filled
river
gorges
that
have
captivated
Baliâs
visitors
for
decades
and
are
so
much
part
of
the
regionâs
legendary
mystique
For
schedules
of
dance
performances
and
other
events
in
the
vicinity
pay
an
early
visit
to
the
Bina

information
office
on
Jalan

Excellent
very
inexpensive
performances
of
traditional
dance
are
offered
in
the

in
the
center
of

In
addition
to
its
many
shops
markets
and
galleries
Ubud
is
home
to
number
of
interesting
museums
Museum
Puri
Lukisan
is
reached
by
gateway
across
the
road
from
the
tourist
office
on
Jalan
Raya
In
lush
gardens
fine
hall
has
been
built
to
house
the
works
from
the
collection
of
the
Dutch
painter
Rudolf
Bonnet
who
helped
guide
the
Pita
Maha
art
movement
in
the
1930s
and
from
the
collection
of
his
patron
Cokorda
Gde
Agung
Sukawati
who
governed
Ubud
for
many
decades
Look
for
the
work
of
IÂ Gusti
Nyoman
Lempad
one
of
the
first
artists
to
adopt
Western
techniques
and
bring
the
flat
wayang
figures
of
traditional
painting
to
life
Remarkably
he
was
probably
over
50
years
old
when
he
met
Walter
Spies
and
Bonnet
(see
pageÂ 53)
Even
he
did
not
know
his
exact
age
The
museumâs
estimate
that
he
died
in
1978
at
the
age
of
115
may
be
an
exaggeration
IÂ Gusti
Nyoman
Lempad
was
chief
architect
and
sculptor
to
the
ruling
Sukawati
family
of
Ubud
and
designed
the
Pura
Saraswati
temple
with
its
beautiful
lotus
pond
and
water
garden
on

you
can
see
the

of
the
Europeans
who
were
so
influential
as

as
that

Some
of
the
most
striking
pictures
are
by
Indonesians
working
in

While

adopted

East
of
Ubud
Two
of
Baliâs
most
impressive
archaeological
finds
are
concentrated
in
two
small
areas:
one
close
to
Ubud
another
roughly
13Â km
(8Â miles)
away
to
the
northeast
near
Tampaksiring
Goa
Gajah
Closest
to
Ubud
is
the
so-called
Elephant
Cave
cut
into
the
hillside
below
the
road
just
east
of
Teges
It
probably
dates
from
the
10th
century
a.d.
but
the
whole
site
was
buried
beneath
volcanic
ash
and
mud
When
the
cave
mouth
was
rediscovered
in
1923
the
huge
face
carved
around
it
was
mistaken
for
an
elephantâs
head
and
the
name
has
stuck
Inside
the
mouth
passage
measuring
12Â m
(39Â ft)
long
leads
to
plain
transverse
chamber
reaching
31â2
(11Â ft)
wide
20Â m
(66Â ft)
long
and
high
enough
to
stand
up
in
Dim
electric
lights
reveal
niches
at
either
end
that
are
believed
to
have
housed
shrines:
One
now
holds
damaged
statue
of
the
elephant-headed
god
Ganesha
Later
excavations
revealed
an
11th-century
bathing
pool
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
cave
with
fountains
in
the
shape
of
seven
nymphs
representing
Indiaâs
great
rivers
fairly
steep
scramble
down
the
bank
behind
the
pool
leads
to
another
cave
with
two
ancient
statues
of
Buddha
Yeh
Pulu
Less
than1Â km
(about
1â2Â mile)
east
of
Goa
Gajah
look
for
signpost
to
Yeh
Pulu
pointing
to
the
right
down
quiet
village
street
The
road
soon
ends
but
footpath
continues
through
rice
terraces
and
past
the
local
bathing
pool
The
rock
face
on
the
left
of
the
path
is
carved
in
series
of
scenes
about
25Â m
(82Â ft)
long
Quite
different
from
the
usual
Balinese
style
the
simple
bold
and
naturalistic
figures
include
prince
and
his
servants
out
hunting
wild
boar
with
woman
clinging
to
his
horse
The
carvings
probably
date
from
the
14th
century
but
like
Goa
Gajah
the
site
was
covered
by
mud
and
only
excavated
in
the
1920s

as
the
âTemple

typical
of
the
Dong-son

dating
from
about
300
b.c.
but
whether
it
was
brought
to

here
is
unknown
According
to
legend
it

broken
out
of

only
the
geometric

Tampaksiring
To
the

the

climbs
for
10Â km
(6Â miles)
to
Tampaksiring
where
craft

compete
to
entice

In

to
the

away
long
flight
of

descends
into

lined
by

At
the
bottom
of
the
steps
narrow
passage
and
gateway
cut
through
solid
rock
opens
out
suddenly
into
the
temple
area
To
the
left
two
rows
of
hollows
have
been
carved
out
of
the
cliffs
on
either
side
of
ravine
Legend
says
theyâre
the
marks
of
giantâs
fingernails
scraped
out
in

of
the

Not
to
be
confused
with
the
place
Gunung
Kawi
the
temple
of
Pura
Gunung
Kawi
is
some
way
away
in
the
village
of
Sebatu
and
often
many
visitors
asking
for
directions
have
been
sent
there
by
mistake
In
fact
it
is
worth
the
trip
partly
for
the
sights
and
scenery
en
route
From
Tampaksiring
the
road
opposite
the
turning
to
Tirta
Empul
twists
through
villages
that
specialize
in
the
mass
production
of
woodcarvings
Youâll
see
rows
of
identical
ducks
alongside
armies
of
chess
pieces
and
perhaps
some
original
new
design
of
statue
that
hasnât
yet
hit
any
of
the
shops
Two
successive
right
turns
signposted
lead
to
Sebatu
and
Pura
Gunung
Kawi
brightly
painted
temple
with
sacred
springs
feeding
water
to
ponds
and
bathing
pools
At
the
northern
edge
of
Tampaksiring
the
road
forks
right
Immediately
on
the
left
is
the
temple
and
holy
spring
of
Tirta
Empul
source
of
the
river
that
flows
through
Gunung
Kawi
It
is
believed
to
have
been
created
by
the
god
Indra
to
revive
his
ailing
army
whose
men
had
been
poisoned
by
an
enemy
He
pierced
the
earth
and
out
flowed
amerta
the
water
of
immortality
It
is
still
thought
by
many
to
have
healing
powers
and
the
pools
here
are
often
thronged
with
those
seeking
purification
The
temple
is
situated
against
wooded
hillside
in
contrast
to
the
nearby
souvenir
shops
which
are
some
of
the
less
attractive
in
Bali
High
above
the
temple
stands
government
rest
house
built
by
the
Dutch
and
turned
into
palace
by
the
late
President
Sukarno
who
they
say
kept
telescope
trained
on
the
womenâs
pool
Eastern
Bali
In
contrast
to
the
softer
south
the
mountain
slopes
here
reach
down
to
the
sea
creating
rocky
shores
and
small
bays
Where
there
is
sand
itâs
grey
the
result
of
the
weathering
of

The
rajas
once
ruled
most
of
Bali
from
their
capitals
at
Karangasem
(now
Amlapura)
and
Klungkung
Approaching
from
the
south
the
road
passes
through
busy
Gianyar
also
former
rajaâs
capital
The
brick
palace
in
the
center
of
town
is
still
the
home
of
his
family
and
is
not
open
to
the
public
Weaving
is
the
main
industry
and
number
of
small
factories
and
some
workshops
along
the
road
from
Ubud
are
open
for
tours
Here
you
can
learn
about
making
ikat
(endek
in
Balinese)
using
threads
that
have
been
tie-dyed
in
bunches
before
weaving
Klungkung
The
dynasty
founded
by
Batu
Renggong
the
first
Dewa
Agung
was
paramount
in
Bali
for
300Â years
first
ruling
from
Gelgel
and
then
moving
to
Klungkung
in
1710
Standing
high
above
the
modern
town
where
its
broad
main
streets
cross
the
Kerta
Gosa
Pavilion
the
Royal
Hall
of
Justice
was
built
at
the
time
of
the
move
and
continued
as
courthouse
under
the
Dutch
The
ceiling
is
covered
in
vivid
paintings
in
style
unique
to
the
region
Although
the
paintings
have
frequently
been
restored
and
in
fact
entirely
replaced
more
than
once
the
work
has
always
been
done
by
artists
from
the
nearby
village
of
Kamasan
and
it
is
likely
that
the
designs
resemble
the
18th-century
originals
Many
of
the
panels
relate
tales
from
Balinese
mythology
but
visitorsâ
eyes
tend
to
be
drawn
to
the
series
depicting
the
dreadful
punishments
awaiting
evildoers
in
the
kingdom
of
the
dead
Important
guests
were
received
in
the
exquisite
Bale
Kambang
pavilion
surrounded
by
water
to
give
the
appearance
that
it
is
floating
among
the
water
lilies
Its
painted
ceiling
illustrates
more
lyrical
stories
from
Balinese
legend
Facing
the
palace
garden
small
museum
has
been
opened
in
one
of
the
old
buildings
Some
of
the
most
impressive
exhibits
are
the
photographs
of
the
rajas
and
their
families
dating
from
before
1908
the
year
of
the
puputan
which
took
place
in
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
palace
and
marked
the
end
of
effective
resistance
to
the
Dutch
(see
pageÂ 19)
Across
the
street
monument
erected
in
1992
commemorates
that
tragic
event
West
of
Klungkung
narrow
lane
leads
to
the
village
of
Tihingan
one
of
only
two
places
in
Bali
where
the
gongs
for
gamelan
orchestras
are
made
The
other
is
Sawan
near
the
north
coast
(see
pageÂ 65)
In
any
of
the
bronze
foundries
youâll
find
the
same
medieval
scene
with
boy
apprentice
pumping
the
bellows
to
keep
charcoal
fire
blazing
while
the
smiths
hammer
away
Hanging
mats
keep
the
place
in
semi-darkness
so
that
the
workers
can
judge
the
temperature

NyomanÂ Gunarsa
On
the
eastern
periphery
of
Klungkung
bridge
crosses
the
gorge
of
the
Unda
river
which
is
used
as
big
communal
bath
every
afternoon
as
the
sun
goes
down
Ash
mud
and
floods
from
the
1963
eruption
of
Gunung
Agung
devastated
this
part
of
the
island
and
the
effects
are
still
felt
today
as
its
agriculture
has
not
yet
fully
recovered
from
the
disaster
Goa
Lawah
Considered
one
of
Baliâs
oddities
the
Bat
Cave
and
its
temple
are
hemmed
in
by
souvenir
stalls
hawkers
sash
dispensers
donation
collectors
ticket
sellers
and
for
most
of
the
day
parked
tour
buses
Once
past
this
obstacle
course
youâll
see
the
cave
mouth
and
seething
mass
of
leathery
bats
clinging
to
the
rock
face
here
and
there
dropping
off
circling
and
then
coming
in
to
land
again
They
canât
all
find
place
in
the
cave
so
some
hang
outside
in
broad
daylight
If
you
are
staying
anywhere
near
perhaps
at
Candi
Dasa
you
might
time
visit
here
for
dusk
Thatâs
when
the
bat
colony
pours
out
of
the
cave
like
liquid
black
stream
and
wheels
away
into
the
distance
to
feed
on
the
myriad
insects
of
the
tropical
night
On
the
foreshore
near
the
Bat
Cave
few
people
scratch
living
by
harvesting
salt
Seawater
is
first
concentrated
by

in
shallow
pans
and
then
transferred

Padangbai
This
little
port
stands
on
Baliâs
only
natural
harbor
with
an
unobstructed
approach
from
the
sea
The
first
Dutch
ships
dropped
anchor
in
the
sheltered
bay
in
1597
(see
pageÂ 14)
Todayâs
cruise
ships
usually
do
the
same
and
their
passengers
are
ferried
ashore
for
sightseeing
excursions
regular
passenger
and
car
ferry
makes
two
or
three
sailings
per
day
to
Lombok
The
voyage
can
be
rough
and
may
take
longer
than
the
scheduled
four
hours
Many
visitors
opt
for
the
newer
faster
and
more
expensive
twin-hull
Mabua
Express
ferry
from
Benoa
Port
(see

but
backpackers
and
most
locals
prefer
this
traditional
albeit
less
comfortable
route
Fishermen
land
their
catches
at
Padangbaiâs
small
busy
beach
which
is
jammed
with
boats
just
to
the
north
of
the
main
jetty
Facing
it
at
the
far
end
are
two
or
three
simple
but
adequate
cottage-style
homestays
You
can
arrange
diving
or
fishing
trips
here
but
the
water
in
the
bay
looks
too
dirty
for
swimming
Beyond
Padangbai
comes
the
broad
sweep
of
Amuk
Bay
site
of
controversial
new
oil
terminal
At
its
eastern
end
after
the
coast
road
crosses
an
iron
bridge
track
leads
down
to
the
sea
at
the
village
of
Buitan
also
called
Balina
Beach
the
name
of
its
main
hotel
and
SCUBA-diving
center
Candi
Dasa
(pronounced
Chandi
Dasa)
Cottage-style
hotels
and
homestays
began
to
be
built
along
this
stretch
of
coast
in
the
late
1970s
People
in
search
of
more
quiet
than
Kuta
and
lower
prices
than
at
Sanur
and
Nusa
Dua
liked
the
easy-going
atmosphere
the
beach
of
grey
volcanic
sand
and
snorkeling
over
the
reef
But
in
the
1980s
the
coral
reef
was
mined
and
destroyed
for
cement
to
build
new
hotels
the
beach
it
had
protected
was
washed
away
and
the
shoreline
quickly
eroded
In
an
attempt
to
stem
the
loss
ugly
jetties
were
built
and
network
of
concrete
blocks
was
planted
into
the
sea
The
erosion
has
been
stopped
but
probably
not
reversed
Thereâs
still
some
dark
sand
exposed
during
low
tide
mixed
with
broken
coral
so
it
is
advisable
to
wear
shoes
if
you
want
to
swim
in
the
sea
If
nothing
else
the
beach
erosion
has
helped
to
keep
Candi
Dasa
quiet
place
well-stocked
with
hotel
rooms;
it
has
also
halted
plans
that
would
have
led
to
even
more
development
In
an
island
of
varied
villages
Tenganan
is
one
of
the
strangest
From
Candi
Dasa
it
is
4Â km
(21â2Â miles)
inland
on
the
lower
slopes
of
Mount
Agung
The
residents
there
are
Bali
Aga
âoriginal
Balinese,â
and
many
of
their
customs
and
rituals
date
from
the
animist
days
before
the
advent
of
Hinduism
They
have
their
own
music
and
dances
Marriage
outside
the
community
used
to
be
forbidden
and
the
population
shrank
Once
the
rule
was
eased
the
downsizing
trend
halted
The
rough
road
from
the
coast
terminates
at
parking
area
outside
the
village
walls
where
you
are
asked
to
make
donation
before
entering
One
long
street
climbs
up
from
the
main
gateway
past
succession
of
open-sided
pavilions
and
up
cobblestoned
terraces
By
day
it
becomes
continuous
market
with
some
unusually
chatty
cheerful
shopkeepers
The
weavers
of
Tenganan
are
well
known
for
making
grinsing
(or
gerinsing)
cloth
double
ikat
(see
pageÂ 93)
in
which
both
warp
and
weft
threads
are
tie-dyed
in
bunches
before
weaving
The
intricacy
of
the
process
of
lining
up
the
patterns
can
only
be
imagined:
It
takes
months
to
make
sarong
and
prices
are
high
Youâll
see
lot
of
cloth
that
is
fakeÂ âÂ the
genuine
item
is
rare
Amlapura
(Karangasem)
North
of
Candi
Dasa
the
road
turns
inland
crossing
hills
and
fertile
valleys
with
views
of
the
volcanic
cone
of
Gunung
Agung
Amlapura
was
known
as
Karangasem
before
1963
That
is
still
the
name
of
the
region
but
its
capital
wanted
to
erase
the
memory
of
Mount
Agungâs
eruption
and
perhaps
to
confuse
any
evil
spirits
who
might
still
want
to
destroy
the
town
of
Karangasem
Part
of
the
rajaâs
palace
and
gardens
were
damaged
then
but
there
has
been
some
restoration
and
one
of
three
palaces
at
the
site
Puri
Agung
is
open
to
visitors
The
last
raja
fancied
his
talents
as
an
architect
and
built
two
rather
elaborate
water
gardens
Ujung
on
the
coast
was
built
in
the
1920s
It
was
devastated
in
1963
but
some
of
its
gateways
pavilions
terraces
and
its
weed-choked
pool
still
stand
forlorn
and
deserted
like
the
relics
of
some
far
more
ancient
civilization
From
Ujung

the
eastern

The

enough
to
make
the

ride
to
Amed
worth
the
effort
Thereâs
much
more
beautiful
alternativeÂ âÂ taking
in
the
rajaâs
second
fancy
creation
the
water
playground
in
the
hills
at
Tirtagangga
5Â km
(3Â miles)
northwest
of
Amlapura
This
water
garden
was
only
established
after
World
War
II
and
despite
being
nearer
to
the
eruption
it
was
spared
serious
damage
You
can
cool
off
in
the
spring-fed
pools
built
for
the
rajaâs
family
and
there
are
places
to
stay
if

Here
many

The
Mountains
To
the
Balinese
the
mountains
are
the
abode
of
the
gods
the
source
of
the
rivers
that
water
their
crops
and
of
occasional
outbursts
of
destructive
fury
The
highest
of
them
are
active
or
dormant
volcanoes:
Gunung
Batur
simmers
more
or
less
continuously
while
Gunung
Agung
erupts
violently
once
every
few
hundred
years
When
you
set
out
for
the
higher
altitudes
be
prepared
for
cold
with
damp
mists
or
for
scorching
sunshine.Either
condition
is
possible
Many
tour
companies
run
day
trips
sometimes
combining
visits
to
Besakih
(see
pageÂ 60)
and
Penelokan
(see
pageÂ 58)
This
is
an
easy
way
to
see
the
views
but
you
will
arrive
at
the
same
time
as
hundreds
of
others
With
more
and
more
accommodations
opening
think
about
overnighting
at
mountain
resort
or
an
inexpensive
guest
house
If
you
plan
to
climb
one
of
the
peaksÂ âÂ not
mountaineering
feat
but
few
hoursâ
or
full

hill
walking
and
scrambling
over
rocksÂ âÂ itâs
essential
to
stay
nearby
and
start
early
Bangli
On
the
main
road
from
the
south
towards
Mount
Batur
the
chief
town
of
the
former
rajadom
of
Bangli
looks
like
nursery
for
gorgeous
flowering
shrubs
It
comes
alive
every
three
days
for
the
big
morning
market
in
the
central
square
To
the
south
of
town
on
the
Gianyar
road
is
Pura
Dalem
Penuggekan
typical
example
of
the
many
temples
for
the

Carved

show
the
nightmarish

in
the
after-life
On
the
northern

the
chief
temple
of
the

of
Bangli
Pura
Kehen
comprises
the
typical
three
courtyards
here
particularly
large
and
linked
by
steep

The

The
roads
from

climb
out
of
the
rice

of
the

through
coffee
plantations
and

at
around
600Â m
(2,000Â ft)
eventually
thinning
out
into
open

out
the

until
you

on
the
narrow
rim
of
huge
crater
(technically
caldera
or

Penelokan
(âPlace

can
offer
great
panorama
but
itâs
an
ugly
village
at
its
worst
when
enveloped
in
cold
wet
fog
and
you
canât
see
the
view
anyway
The
peddlers
here
are
the
most
aggressive
in
Bali:
Balinese
travelers
have
complained
about
them
since
long
before
the
arrival
of
tourists
The
height
of
confusion
comes
at
lunchtime
when
the
tour
buses
disgorge
their
passengers
at
the
restaurants
especially
built
for
them
Avoid
the
buffets
which
are
often
not
fresh
and
notorious
for
making
visitors
ill
Thereâs
an
even
better
view
into
the
caldera
and
no

from
the

short
way
east
from
Penelokan
(heading

Mount
Batur
went
into
an
active
phase
in
August
1994
blowing
huge
puffs
of
smoke
and
rocky
debris
from
new
vent
on
its
northwest
face
As
result
some
of
the

there
were
cut
In

On

lies
Tirta

They
are
believed
to
be
both
holy
and
highly

base
for
the
two-hour
climb
(longer
in
the
heat
of
the
day)
to
the
summit
of
Mount
Batur
Itâs
best
to
start
before
dawn:
Some
of
the
guided
parties
set
out
as
early
as
3:30am
Guides
available
locally
or
at
Kintamani
can
suggest
various
longer
hikes
Batur

One
long

the

the

worth
it
Gunung

at
3,142Â m
(10,309Â ft)

also
its
holiest
Still

Besakih
known
as
Baliâs
âmother

stands
high
up
on
the

youâll
see
forest
of
black
thatched
pagoda-like
meru
roofs
rising
in
tiers
above
the
rice
terraces
with
the
volcano
as
backdrop
This
was
probably
even
holy
place
in
the
pre-Hindu
era
During
more
than
thousand
years
it
has
evolved
into
complex
of
nearly
200
temples
and
shrines
The
most
important
group
stands
in

Most
tour
buses
arrive
at
mid-morning
and
mid-afternoon
but
no
matter
when
you
visit
you
will
be
harassed
by
hawkers
goaded
by
guides
and
ordered
by
gatekeepers
to
make
donations
Local
people
donât
see
this
commercial
activity
as
inappropriate;
to
them
temple
isnât
holy
place
until
the
gods
are
present
and
that
only
happens
during
religious
ceremony
There
are
also
guides
offering
their
services
to
those
who
want
to
climb
Gunung
Agung;
only
the
fit
and
well-prepared
should
attempt
it
and
only
in
the
dry
season
Even
then
the
expedition
can
take
as
long
as
twelve
hours
and
involves

of
slipping
and
sliding
on
stony
slopes

while
the

of
routes
to

The
main

descends
by
way
of

direct
to

Alternatively
you
can
take
the
little-used

past

Buyan
and
Tamblingan
and
down
through
Munduk
to
Seririt
(see

The

and
you
will

Munduk
is
home

new
attraction
in

is
the

Pyramid
Plastic
built
from

The
North
Coast
Before
the
days
of
flying
most
visitors
to
Bali
arrived
in
the
north
The
first
Dutch
military
expeditions
disembarked
near
Singaraja
which
became
the
islandâs
administrative
capital
and
the
colonyâs
chief
port
Now
almost
everyone
arrives
and
stays
in
southern
Bali
and
only
fraction
of
them
ever
take
trip
to
the
north
coast
although
the
journey
takes
less
than
two
hours
by
road
There
is
quite
contrast
between
the
south
and
north
It
is
hotter
and
drier
in
the
north
and
far
less
densely
populated
The
proportion
of
Muslims
is
higher;
some
of
the
people
are
descended
from
traders
and
immigrants
from
other
islands
There
is
only
narrow
strip
of
flat
land
between
the
mountains
and
the
sea
or
in
some
places
none
at
all
Cactus
plants
are
as
common
as
palm
trees
and
the
small
area
of
rice
depends
on
irrigation
The
region
is
also
dotted
with
Baliâs
local
vineyards
Lacking
an
airport
losing
the
status
of
capital
and
denied
any
substantial
cash
flow
from
tourism
Singaraja
hasnât
expanded
as
much
as
Denpasar
As
can
be
expected
from
the
former
capital
colonial
buildings
predominate
in
the
port
area
of
Bululeng
(the
original
town
that
gave
its
name
to
the
northern
rajadom)
and
the
old
center
But
thereâs
little
to
detain
visitor
and
no
attractive
accommodations
For
that
you
have
to
travel
short
distance
out
ofÂ town
Lovina
Beach
The
beaches
west
of
Singaraja
began
to
attract
escapist
travelers
in
the
early
1970s
and
simple
and
fairly
inexpensive
accommodations
were
built
to
house
them
Slowly
the
number
of
visitors
grew
and
the
small
homestays
turned
themselves
into
larger
bungalow-type
hotels
Today
tour
groups
come
for
short
stays
and
as
everywhere
in
Bali
standards
and
prices
are
steadily
going
up
Actually
Lovina
is
not
one
village
but
string
of
small
ones
starting
6Â km
(4Â miles)
west
of
Singaraja
and
continuing
for
10Â km
(6Â miles)
up
the
coast
road
Shops
restaurants
and
moneychangers
are
scattered
along
the
busy
stretch
The
beach
itself
is
shallow
and
gently
shelving
making
it
an
ideal
place
for
small
children
There
is
calm
water
on
the
inside
of
the
reef
and
good
snorkeling
over
it
Lovinaâs
dark
sand
is
less
inviting
than
the
white
or
golden
variety
at
the
southern
resorts
and
gets
too
hot
to
walk
on
in
bare
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
day
Dawn
and
dusk
are
the
best
times
for
the
beach
Dolphins
frolic
offshore
almost
every
morningÂ âÂ boats
will
take
you
out
to
see
them
up
close
At
sunset
the
fishermen
prepare
for
nightâs
work
aided
by
batteries
of
lights
on
the
boats
to
attract
their
catch
while
local
farmers
herd
their
goats
or
lead
their
water
buffaloes
along
the
sand
If
youâre
lucky
you
may
be
around
to
see
the
races
between
beautifully
decorated
pairs
of
water
buffaloes
pulling
sled
around
track
in
the
fields
Ask
if
any
are
scheduled:
They
follow

calendar
East
of
Singaraja
Once
clear
of
the
outskirts
of
the
town
at
Sangsit
look
for
turn
off
the
main
road
(there
will
be
signs)
heading
towards
the
sea
to
the
beautiful
temple
of
Pura
Beji
Dedicated
to
the
rice
goddess
this
is
the
most
elaborate
and
ornate
temple
in
the
north
Itâs
decorated
with
intricate
carvings
of
flowers
animals
gods
and
monsters
The
road
that
leads
inland
for
5Â km
(3Â miles)
will
take
you
to
Jagaraga
village
fortified
by
Jelantik
against
the
Dutch
colonialists
in
1848
and
1849
The
small
temple
on
the
left-hand
side
just
before
you
reach
the
village
center
has
some
of
the
strangest
carved
stone
decoration
in
BaliÂ âÂ and
some
of
the
most
secular
dating
from
the
1930s
In
one
panel
an
open-top
car
carries
two
European
passengers
being
held
up
by
man
with
gun
while
others
point
up
at
some
airplanesÂ âÂ one
of
them
crashing
into
the
sea
Jagaraga
is
also
famous
for
its
dance
troupes
which
can
sometimes
be
seen
in
performance
here
About
2Â km
(11â2Â miles)
to
the
south
of
Jagaraga
Sawan
has
couple
of
gongmakersâ
workshops
that
supply
gamelan
orchestras:
The
only
other
village
where
the
craft
is
practiced
is
in
Tihingan
situated
near
Klungkung
(see
pageÂ 51)
Methods
are
utterly
traditional
Bronze
is
made
by
melting
copper
and
tin
together
by
heating
them
in
an
ancient
pot
over
red-hot
charcoal
or
else
old
and
broken
instruments
are
recycled
The
molten
bronze
is
poured
into
stone
molds
to
form
rough
discs
which
are
then
hammered
and
heated
and
hammered
again
until
they
finally
take
the
shape
of
gongs
Itâs
essential
that
the
craftsmen
who
make
the
gongs
have
musical
ear
so
that
they
are
able
to
hear
whether
the
sets
of
gongs
are
suitable
for
the
five-tone
Balinese
scale
The
correct
note
is
ensured
by
adjusting
the
mass
of
metal
and
its
distribution
over
the
surface
of
the
gong
Back
on
the
coast

at
Kumbutambahan

youâll
come
to
Pura

an

large
part
of
this
end
of
the

has
been
designated
as
the
Bali
Barat
National
Park
and
the
road
crosses
small
section
of
it
an
area
covered
with
woodland
and
scrub
with
plenty
of
grey
monkeys
The
park
encompasses
and
protects
760Â sqÂ km
of
true
rainforests
mangrove
swamps
and
woodlands
and
is
home
to
over
100Â species
of
birds
(including
the
endangered
Bali
Starling)
as
well
as
many
indigenous
animals
Visitors
to
the

West
of

Fertile
land
and
high
rainfall
have
brought
prosperity
to
this
part
of
Bali
without
the
debatable
benefits
of
tourism
In
the
main
towns
youâll
find
more
computer
suppliers
than
souvenir
shops
There
is
very
little
in
the
way
of
accommodations
and
not
much
choice
when
it
comes
to
eating
but
the
region
is
rewarding
to
explore
Mengwi
Just
to
the
northwest
of
Kapal
thereâs
major
road
junction
The
right
fork
goes
north
to
Bedugul
(see
pageÂ 61)
and
Singaraja
but
you
only
have
to
go
3Â km
(2Â miles)
to
reach
the
town
of
Mengwi
where
youâll
find
one
of
Baliâs
most
beautiful
temples
Pura
Taman
Ayun
near
the
center
of
town
was
built
in
1634
and
renovated
in
1937
Itâs
notable
for
its
double
moat
Every
morning
as
well
as
late
in
the
afternoon
people
use
the
wide
outer
moat
for
washing
themselves
and
their
clothes
You
can
circle
the
outside
of
the
wall
that
surrounds
the
inner
compound
and
look
in
at
the
cluster
of
merus
(pagoda-like
multi-roofed
towers)
Meru
towers
may
only
contain
an
odd
number
of
roofs
Once
the
daily
influx
of
visitors
begins
about
mid-morning
an
outrigger
boat
shuttles
people
across
the
outer
moat
to
craft
display
and
shop
North
of
Mengwi
(signposted
as
it
is
situated
off
the
main
road)
is
Sangeh
Monkey
Forest
grove
of
tall
nutmeg
trees
protected
for
their
religious
significance
and
also
as
nature
preserve
The
residents
engage
in
their
business
swinging
from
branch
to
branch
and
they
flock
to
Bukit
Sari
the
temple
while
hawkers
swarm
around
the
visitors
Remember
to
hide
all
portable
possessions
from
the
monkeys
Those
in
the
mood
to
explore
should
head
north
from
Sangeh
where
the
road
climbs
into
lovely
countryside
and
rarely
visited
villages
Eventually
it
peters
out
on
the
slopes
of
Mount
Catur
Marga
In
November
1946
Ngurah
Rai
and
his
men
were
trapped
by
Dutch
forces
close
to
this
village
12Â km
(7Â miles)
northwest
of
Mengwi
In
an
heroic
but
hopeless
last
stand
they
were
all
killed
(see
pageÂ 21)
The
battlefield
just
north
of
the
village
is
now
marked
by
several
memorials
statue
depicts
aÂ group
of
defiant
freedom
fighters
The
Margarana
monument
is
tall
candi
(or
shrine)
whose
columns
carry
the
symbols
of
pancasila
theÂ five
principles
of
the
Indonesian
state
(see
pageÂ 37)
Carved
panels
record
Ngurah
Raiâs
message
to
the
Dutch
demanding
their
withdrawal
and
ending
with
the
words
âSekali
Merdeka
Tetap
Merdekaâ
(âFreedom
now
freedom
foreverâ)
Beyond
the
shrine
is
field
of
memorials
to
all
those
who
died
for
the
cause
of
Baliâs
independenceÂ âÂ 1,372Â men
and
women
in
total
It
looks
like
cemetery
but
these
are
not
actual
graves
The
museum
at
the
site
is
worth
visit
for
the
photographs
and
other
relics
of
the
campaign
If
you
have
reliable
transport
and
good
road
map
head
farther
north
into
the
hills
for
16
km
(10
miles)
along
little-used
roads
to
Pura
Luhur
the
chief
temple
of
the
rajadom
of
Tabenan
beautifully
set
amid
lush
forest
Despite
its
ancient
appearance
this
is
modern
reconstructionÂ âÂ lichens
grow
quickly
in
the
high
humidity
Tanah
Lot
Practically
every
brochure
for
Bali
shows
this
exotic
sea
temple
on
its
rocky
islet
often
silhouetted
against
the
setting
sun
Inevitably
tour
buses
converge
here
in
late
afternoon
so
everyone
can
take
that
same
picture
It
is
10Â km
(6Â miles)
down
narrow
side
road
from
Kediri
to
the
coast
and
there
can
be
long
procession
of
traffic
You
might
like
to
plan
dawn
visit
instead
avoiding
at
least
some
of
the
hawkers
who
congregate
later
in
the
day
Tanah
Lot
is
believed
to
have
been
founded
in
the
16th
century
by
the
Javanese
priest
Nirarta
who
dedicated
it
to
the
sea
god
Now
the
sea
threatens
to
undermine
the
rock
on
which
it
stands
and
concrete
breakwaters
have
been
positioned
to
hold
back
the
waves
Nothing
however
is
done
to
hold
back
the
commercial
tide
Ever
more
souvenir
stands
and
food
stalls
cluster
as
near
as
they
can
get
and
the
nearby
coast
is
being
developed
as
huge
and
controversial
resort
complex
But
the
former
rajaâs
capital
of
Tabanan
goes
about
its
business
with
few
concessions
to
tourism
The
Dutch
burned
the
palace
here
in
1906
so
the
heart
of
the
old
town
is
gone
but
Tabanan
remains
center
for
music
and
dance
Kerambitan
just
off
the
main
road
to
the
southwest
is
pretty
town
with
three
palaces
still
the
property
of
princely
family
Today
one
of
the
palaces
the
Puri
Anyar
acts
as
an
aristocratic
type
of
homestay
where
guests
can
experience
the
traditional
hospitality
that
might
have
been
extended
to
honored
visitors
in
the
past
The
main
road
reaches
the
coast
at
Soka
with
two
small
beaches
and
occasional
good
surfing
waves
Balian
Beach
is
similar
with
informal
bungalow
accommodations
Experienced
surfers
head
west
to
Medewi
where
simple
but
pleasant
new
cottage-style
hotels
face
mostly
rocky
shore
with
small
beach
The

temple
at
Rambut

off
the
main

Negara
23Â km
(14Â miles)
farther
west
is
known
for
its
water-buffalo
racing
The

traditionally
ran
in
September
and
October
and
the
championships
still
take
place
then
but
races
for
the
benefit
of

are
now
staged
year-round
on

Lombok
Baliâs
smaller
neighbor
to
the
east
easily
visible
on
clear
day
is
at
times
billed
by
hopeful
promoters
and
developers
as
âthe
next
Bali.â
That
however
paints
misleading
picture;
the
scenery
the
people
their
culture
and
religion
are
all
too
different
There
is
less
rainfall
and
the
rainy
season
is
prone
to
fail
leaving
most
of
the
island
parched
and
dusty
It
may
be
only
20-minute
flight
away
or
few
hours
by
ferry
but
itâs
another
world
Lombok
is
roughly
70Â km
(43Â miles)
from
north
to
south
and
the
same
distance
across
Its
one
great
mountain
Gunung
Rinjani
is
the
second
highest
in
Indonesia
and
dominates
the
northern
half
of
the
island
Most
people
live
on
the
east-west
plain
across
the
middle
fertile
after
rain
and
sun-scorched
by
the
dry
season
The
far
south
is
arid
with
low
scrub-covered
hills
and
eroded
valleys
rather
like
some
parts
of
northern
Australia
From
study
of
their
plants
and
animals
the
19th-century
naturalist
Alfred
Wallace
divided
the
Indonesian
islands
into
western
group
regarded
as
part
of
southeast
Asia
and
an
eastern
group
which
belonged
geographically
to
Australia/Oceania
He
then
drew
the
line
between
the
two
through
the
deep
Lombok
Strait
separating
Bali
and
Lombok
The
division
is
not
quite
so
clear-cut
now
but
the
basic
principle
of
the
âWallace
Lineâ
is
still
accepted
For
many
years
the
island
of
Lombok
was
the
domain
of
the
Sasaks
people
who
had
come
from
the
Asian
mainland
by
way
of
Java
and
Bali
They
were
animists
who
revered
the
spirits
they
believed
to
be
in
the
living
things
and
inanimate
objects
around
them
As
Islam
spread
through
the
islands
(apart
from
Bali)
some
people
in
Lombok
adopted
it
in
version
of
their
own
Wektu
Telu
which
retained
many
influences
of
animism
Today
majority
of
people
are
more
or
less
orthodox
Muslims:
As
you
travel
about
Lombok
you
will
notice
many
exotic
country
mosques
with
their
domes
and
arabesque
arcades
as
well
as
the
growing
numbers
of
young
women
who
wear
robes
and
headscarves
The
first
succession
of
Balinese
invasions
started
in
the
16th
century
For
while
most
of
Lombok
was
governed
from
Karangasem
in
Bali
Later
the
Balinese
province
in
Lombok
became
independent
and
even
attempted
to
capture
Karangasem!
The
beliefs
of
the
animist-Hindu
Balinese
and
the
animist-Muslim
Sasaks
however
were
not
always
in
conflict;
there
was
lot
of
intermarriage
Today
the
Balinese
minority
mainly
lives
in
west
Lombok
and
is
influential
in
commerce
and
tourism
At
the
end
of
the
19th
century
the
Dutch
took
advantage
of
the
conflict
raging
between
the
Sasaks
and
Balinese
joining
in
on
the
Sasak
side
and
then
taking
complete
control
After
the
Japanese
occupied
Lombok
during
World
War
II
the
Dutch
briefly
returned
only
to
depart
again
when
Indonesia
gained
independence
Where
to
Go
in
Lombok
You
wonât
find
many
notable
temples
palaces
or
other
historic
sites
but
visitors
to
Lombok
are
rewarded
with
the
pleasures
of
the
islandâs
relaxed
rustic
ways:
the
sight
of
water
buffaloes
and
their
calves;
hens
and
chicks
dashing
across
your
path;
sudden
views
of
blue
sea
dotted
with
sails
Most
visitors
stay
in
the
hotels
alongside
Senggigi
beach
but
the
far
south
and
the
offshore
Gilis
also
have
good
beaches
and
snorkeling
Some
villages
are
renowned
for
their
traditional
craftsÂ âÂ intricate
basketry
weaving
pottery
or
carving
few
of
them
have
realized
the
chances
of
increasing
the
flow
of
tourist
traffic
setting
up
stalls
by
the
roadside
or
getting
younger
members
of
the
family
to
bring
visitors
to
have
look
at
the
work
going
on
For
an
insight
into
village
life
itâs
worth
inquiring
about
the
timing
of
local
market
days
held
in
the
mornings
once
or
twice
week
in
many
towns
and
villages
Roads
are
refreshingly
free
of

prime
source
of

One
of
the
most
pleasant
exotic
ways
to
arrive
in
Lombok
is
on
the
Bounty
and
Mabua
Express
ferries
Faster
and
more
comfortable
(and
more
expensive)
than
the
older
ferries
from
Padangbai
these
leave
Bali
from
Benoa
Harbor
and
arrive
at
Bangsal
close
to
the
Gilli
Islands
Small
craft
take
you
from
the
ferries
to
the

at
Bangsal
or
to
the

avoiding
the
grungy

the
more
idyllic
parts
of

Not
so
long
ago
the
old
port
of
Ampenan
the
administrative
center
of
Mataram
and
the
commercial
district
of
Cakranegara
were
completely
separate
Now
they
have

lined
by
an
improbable
number
of
government
buildings
links
them
all
and
then
continues
to
Sweta
the
islandâs
transport
hub
The
port
area
of
Ampenan
is
crumbling
and
mostly
disused
but
the
narrow
streets
of
the
old
town
are
livelier
Many
of
the
people
here
are
descended
from
Arab
tradersÂ âÂ noticeable
in
the
well-attended
mosques
and
the
cries
of
the
muezzins
in
their
minarets
calling
the
faithful
to
prayer

is
south
of

on
Jalan
Banjar
Tilar

gives
an
overview
of
the
islandâs
culture
as
well
as
its
unique
and
volatile
ecology
Mataram
has
the
array
of
government
institutions
found
in
every
Indonesian

Cakranegara
(or
just
CakraÂ âÂ remember
that
it
is
pronounced
âChakraâ)
grew
up
around
the
palace
of
the
Balinese
rajas
Today
it
is
the
commercial
center
of
Lombok
All
that
remains
today
of
the
royal
compound
is
the
1744

the
former
meeting
hall
and
court
of
justice
standing
in
the

This
was
the
scene
of
short-lived
Balinese
victory
over
Dutch
troops
in
1894
The
result
was
reversed
only
weeks
later
and
the
Dutch
went
on
to
take
over
the
whole
island
Across
the

Pura

the

In

the

Batubolong
temple

perched
on

point
to
watch
the

over
the
Lombok
Strait
The
prime
place
to
stay
is
around
Senggigi
Beach
just
north
of
Batubolong
There
are
accommodations
in
all
sizes
strung
out
along
10-km
(6-mile)
strip
of
coast
starting
about
8Â km
(5Â miles)
north
of
Ampenan
The
beach
shelves
steeply
in
places
and
the
coral
reef
or
rocks
can
be
just
below
the
surface
so
itâs
advisable
to
wear
rubber
shoes
North
of
Senggigi
the
road
is
like
one
big
giddy
roller-coaster
that
passes
some
of
the
lovliest
coastline
in
the
Indonesian
archipelago
At
times
it
climbs
to
the
cliff
tops
and
then
swoops
down
into
bays
Tiny
fishing
villages
hide
among
the
palm
trees
and
the
sea
is
flecked
with
bright
lateen
sails
of
prahus
out
after
tuna
and
snapper
Instead
of
the
coast
road
tours
from
Senggigi
and
traffic
from
Mataram
sometimes
take
the
inland
route
via
the
Pasuk
Pass
The
two
ways
meet
at
Pemenang
where
side
road
leads
to
harbor
at
Bangsal
the
starting
point
for
trips
to
the
Gilis
(Visitors
often
call
them
the
Gili
Islands
but
gili
means
âisland.â)
Gili
Air
is
nearest
about
3Â km
(2Â miles)
away
Next
comes
Gili
Meno
and
then
Gili
Trawangan
the
farthest
out
at
8Â km
(5Â miles)
and
the
biggest
although
itâs
only
21â2Â km
(11â2Â miles)
long
The
Gilis
are
known
for
their
tranquility
surrounded
by
sparkling
waters
Snorkeling
diving
and
sunning
are
the
islandsâ
chief
activities
The
boats
that
ply
the
route
from
Bangsal
to
the
islands
wait
for
full
load
of
15
to
20Â people
In
July
and
August
that
wonât
take
long
but
out
of
season
you
can
face
delay
unless
you
pay
for
the
empty
places
or
charter
whole
boat
(fares
are
low
and
fixed)
Thereâs
losmen
or
bungalow
accommodations
and
growing
number
of

very
comfortable
small
hotels
on
all
three
islands
as
well
as
small
stores
where
you
can
buy
basic
food
bottled
water
and
cold
drinks
Warungs
serve
simple

mostly
the
standard

Mountain
Treks
The
silhouette
of
Gunung
Rinjani
3,726Â m
(12,200Â ft)
tall
can
be
seen
from
every
part
of
the
island
sometimes
as
single
peak
other
times
like
line
of
broken
teeth
An
active
volcano
(although
there
has
been
no
major
eruption
for
century)
the
mountain
is
sacred
to
both
Sasaks
and
Balinese
who
make
pilgrimages
to
its
crater
lake
and
hot
springs
Recently
it
has
begun
to
attract
foreigners
too
and
two
villages
in
the
foothills
to
the
south
of
Bayan
are
the
most
popular
starting
points
Trekking
is
only
safe
in
the
dry
season
between
June
and
September
rough
and
narrow
road
from
the
middle
of
Bayan
ascends
rapidly
to
Batu
Koq
and
then
continues
to
nearby
Senaru
where
it
ends
Those
wanting
to
go
farther
have
to
walk
The
original
tiny
village
has
traditional
Sasak
houses
on
stilts
surrounded
by
wooden
fence
Some
of
the
locals
have
opened
homestays
along
the
road
few
with
warung
attached
Guides
and
porters
can
be
hired
by
the
day
and
you
can
buy
basic
food
and
rent
camping
gear
including
tents
Take
water-purifying
tablets
warm
clothes
and
arrange
for
small
camping
stove
The
main
objective
of
most
trekkers
is
the
awesome
crater
with
its
big
C-shaped
lake
Itâs
hard
dayâs
walk
from
Senaru
before
you
reach
the
rim
The
crater
itself
is
600Â m
(2,000Â ft)
deep
and
the
steep
quite
slippery
scramble
down
to
the
lake
takes
several
hours
more
Plan
at
least
three-day
expedition
(five
if
you
also
want
to
climb
to
the
top
of
Rinjani)
Those
with
lot
less
time
and
energy
could
take
half-hour
walk
to
beautiful
waterfall
and
pools
in
the
valley
below
Senaru
South
and
East
Lombok
As
in
Bali
different
areas
specialize
in
particular
crafts
but
until
recently
it
all
happened
behind
closed
doors
Now
the
increased
tourist
traffic
has
encouraged
local
people
to
set
up
stalls
by
the
roadside
and
some
of
the
villages
have
become
quite
accustomed
to
visitors
At
Sukarara
to
the
south
of
Mataram
you
will
find
almost
every
house
has
an
old-fashioned
loom
for
weaving
the
gorgeous
songket
fabric
which
mingles
gold
and
silver
threads
with
cotton
Penujak
little
farther
south
produces
pottery
including
some
trick
water
pots
which
can
be
tipped
upside
down
without
spilling
the
contents
Invert
them
again
and
you
can
pour
as
normal
The
secret
of
this
maneuver
is
clever
interior

of
the

of
Praya

in
the
craft
of
intricate
basketry
They
say
that
it

to
make
large
tablemat
Rambitan
is
traditional
type
of
Sasak
village
with
thatch-and-bamboo
houses
and
tall
rice
barns
but
it
sees
lot
of
visitors
and
you
may
well
be
besieged
by
souvenir
sellers
Sade
is
similar
but
smaller
Look
for
the
simple
thatch-roofed
mosques
in
both
villages
Farther
south
the
dry
scrub-covered
hills
slowly
give

to

with
an
occasional

playing
the
role
of

Energetic
resurfacing
and
new
construction
has
transformed
the
road
but
Kuta
Beach
is
still
far
from
resembling
its
namesake
in
Bali
Most
of
the
time
its
white
coral
sands
are
largely
deserted
Most
accommodations
are
still
in
simple

some
with

What
To
Do
Once
sleepy
capital
with
little
to
do
but
sightsee
by
day
Beijing
has
opened
considerably
to
the
outside
world
since
the
days
of
Chairman
Mao
Entrepreneurs
have
enlivened
the
shopping
scene
and
given
the
capital
its
first
dose
of
nightlife
in
recent
years
Beijing
is
becoming
modern
international
capital
but
one
with
strong
Chinese
characteristics
that
keep
it
an
interesting
and
distinctive
place
to
visit
Shopping
Beijing
has
some
of
the
worldâs
best
places
to
shop
for
Chinese-made
goods
and
traditional
arts
and
crafts
often
with
prices
far
below
those
paid
in
the
West
The
capital
is
renowned
for
its
selection
of
silk
fabrics
and
clothing
embroidery
pearls
jade
porcelains
cloisonnÃ©
lacquerware
carpets
furniture
antiques
and
artwork
(both
contemporary
and
traditional)
The
most
popular
shopping
streets
are
Wangfujing
Dajie
downtown
Liulichang
Culture
Street
and
the
Dazhalan
Mall
south
of
Tiananmen
Square
and
Xidan
Street
west
of
city
center
(the
favorite
of
locals)
All
three
of
these
avenues
are
superb
for
strolling
and
window-shopping
Most
shops
and
stores
stay
open
seven
days
week
from
about
9am
to
8pm
or
later
Some
English
is
spoken
in
most
shops
Few
stores
accept
credit
cards
so
carry
plenty
of
Chinese
cash
ATMs
are
appearing
in
the
capital
but
donât
count
on
finding
one
when
you
need
it
(see

Sunday
is
the

crowded
day
of
the

the
variety
of
goods
available
in
Beijing
(from
crafts

department
store
for
tourists
the
Friendship
Store
located
well
east
of
the

City
(at

Jianguomenwai
Dajie)
Although
small
shops
department
stores
and
large
modern
shopping
plazas
carry
wide
range
of
goods
these
days
the
best
places
to
find
bargains
are
the
street
markets
and
bazaars
scattered
throughout
the
city
These
open-air
markets
are
also
the
most
interesting
places
to
shop
in
Beijing
Best
Buys
Antiques
Beijing
has
antiques
galoreÂ âÂ and
plenty
of
fakes
too
Any

must
have
red
wax
seal
to
allow
export
from
China
Hotel
shops
and
the
Friendship
Store
are
the
most
reliable
antiques
dealers
and
they
often
provide
international
shipping
services
for
purchases
The
antiques
shops
along
Liulichang
Culture

They
should
be
quite
inexpensive
particularly
when
purchased
from
streetside
vendors
Craftworkers
in
China
are
turning
out
an
increasing
number
of
fine
ornaments
aimed
at
foreign
shoppers;
these
make
perfect
Christmas
presents
to
carry
back
home
Carpets
Chinese
carpets
of
silk
or
wool
should
be
inspected
carefully
The
colors
should
not
be
fading
and
the

should
be
fine
and
tightly
woven
Handmade
carpets
from
the
far
western
provinces
and
from
Tibet
are
popular
in
Beijing

anyone
in
China
had
their
own
carved
stamp
called
chop
usually
palm-sized
stone
block
that
was
dipped
in
special

This
ink
stamp
served
as
an
official

you
can
easily
afford
Some

ventures

is
the
rule

exercise
patience

caution
It
helps
to
have
notion
of
the
market
value
of
the
merchandise
by
first
checking
out
prices
in
stores
Street
markets

have
the
lowest
prices
of
all
but
the
initial
price
set
by
the
vendor
is
always
on
the
high
side

Beijing
Located
well
south
of
city
center
inside
the
Third
Ring
Road
it
goes

troupes
Your

as
Beijing
This
Month
Welcome
To
Beijing
and
others
that
are
distributed
to
hotels
and
cafÃ©s
They
list
wide
range
of
entertainment
possibilities
as
well
as
special
events
and
concerts
Beijing
also
has
several
teahouse
theaters
presenting
samplers
of
traditional
entertainment
forms
along
with
snacks
or
dinners
Finally
the
capital
has
growing
number
of
late-night
spots
(some
with
live
pop
music)
and
discos
that
welcome
foreign
visitors
Peking
Opera
and
Acrobatics
Peking
Opera
(Jing
Ju)
today
varies
little
from
the
form
it
assumed
during
the
Qing
Dynasty
about
250
years
ago
The
costumes
choreography
instruments
and
singingÂ âÂ all
quite
unique
to
ChinaÂ âÂ might
seem
strange
to
Westerners
but
these
highly
stylized
elements
are
part
of
familiar
tradition
that
many
Beijingers
love
Other
areas
of
China
have
their
own
regional
styles
of
opera
but
Peking
Opera
is
definitely
the
most
famous
Chinese
opera
becomes
more
comprehensible
and
enjoyable
when
the
plot
is
known
(itâs
usually
historic
drama
or
tragic
love
story)
and
when
subtitles
(in
English)
are
projected
on
side-screen
It
is
also
helpful
to
know
that
the
masks
painted
faces
and
costumes
identify
each
characterâs
social
role
and
personality
and
that
the
live
music
with
its
gongs
and
cymbals
often
functions
like
film
score
to
emphasize
the
action
on
stage
With
the
closing
of
the
centuries-old
Zhengyici
Theater
(an
opera
venue
since
1713)
the
best
place
to
take
in
an
evening
of
exotic
opera
Beijing-style
is
the
Liyuan
Theater
in
the
Qianmen
Hotel
(175
Yongâan
Lu)
Here
spirited
excerpts
from
three
or
four
operas

subtitles

of
snacks)

Grand
Theater

prices
vary
widely
depending

the
seat
location
and
snack
or
meal
options
ranging
from
as
little
as
20
yuan
to
over
200
yuan
for
the
best
seat
and
treats
in
the
house
Acrobatics
are
part
of
most
opera
performances
but
this
2,000-year-old
tradition
in
China
has
produced
its
own
highly
entertaining
performers
Some
of
the
best
acrobatic
groups
are
based
in
Beijing
When

Troupe
performs
at
the
Wansheng
Theater
(95
Tianqiao
Market)
The
Sichuan
Acrobatic
Troupe
often
uses
the
Chaoyang
Theater

expensive
venue
is
provided

the
Poly
Plaza
International
Theater
(14

Dajie)

plate-spinning
and
chair-stacking
